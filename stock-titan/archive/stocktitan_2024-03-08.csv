The collaboration aims at sustainable mining practices. Positive None. Negative None. 03/08/2024 - 03:11 AM STOCKHOLM, March 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- As the first mining operator, Boliden has signed an agreement for the production and delivery of a newly developed explosive with significantly improved environmental and climate performance. As a result, the need for nitrogen treatment of water is strongly reduced and climate performance is improved by around 400 tons of CO2 per year. ""For us, it is important to be part of technology development in many areas and when it is successful, we also want to be early with implementation. Together with the electrification of transport and other machines, this means another important step towards being able to conduct mining operations that are, in principle, fossil-free, says Peter Bergman, General Manager of The Boliden area. As the first mining operator, Boliden has signed an agreement with the Swedish explosives supplier Hypex Bio regarding the production and delivery of nitrate-free and environmentally friendly explosives to Kankbergsgruvan, Boliden. The agreement means that Boliden and Hypex will cooperate on the production and delivery of nitrate-free and environmentally friendly explosives to the Kankberg mine, which includes the establishment of a production facility at the mine as well as a delivery and service agreement. The supply and service agreement for Hypex's explosives solution spans five years starting in 2024. The production quantity is expected to amount to 400 - 450 tonnes and thus largely meet the Kankberg mine's annual needs. In addition to the fact that the explosive drastically reduces the need for nitrogen treatment of water, the climate impact is reduced by approximately 400 tons of CO2 per year (Scope 3). The collaboration between Hypex Bio and Boliden has been ongoing since 2020, where the nitrate-free explosive has been developed and tested in the Kankberg mine. The technology has proven to meet Boliden's requirements for safety, performance, environment and reduced carbon dioxide emissions. Tests have also been carried out in the Garpenberg mine and are to be started in the Aitik copper mine. For further information please contact:Klas Nilsson, Director Group Communications, tel: +46 (0)70-453 65 88klas.nilsson@boliden.com Boliden's vision is to be the most climate-friendly and respected metal provider in the world.

Cool Company Ltd. - Ex Dividend,2024-03-08T06:00:00.000Z,Low,Very Negative,"Cool Company Ltd. (CLCO) announces a dividend of $0.41 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023, impacting trading as of March 8, 2024.","Cool Company Ltd. - Ex Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Negative) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Cool Company Ltd. (CLCO) announces a dividend of $0.41 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023, impacting trading as of March 8, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a dividend of $0.41 per share for Cool Company Ltd. is a substantial event for shareholders and potential investors. Dividends are a way for companies to distribute profits back to shareholders and can be indicative of the company's current financial health and future outlook. The ex-dividend date is crucial as it determines the eligibility of shareholders to receive the declared dividend. Those who own the stock as of March 8, 2024, will receive the payment on the scheduled distribution date.From a financial perspective, the size of the dividend relative to the company's share price can indicate the yield, an important metric for income-focused investors. It's also essential to consider the company's payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders. A sustainable payout ratio typically suggests that the company can continue to pay dividends at the current rate or grow them over time without compromising its financial stability.Moreover, investors often look at dividend announcements as a signal of management's confidence in the company's cash flow and profitability. A steady or increasing dividend could be perceived as a positive sign, while a decrease or suspension might raise concerns about the company's future performance. Market Research Analyst When analyzing the market implications of Cool Company Ltd's dividend announcement, it's important to evaluate the sector averages and the historical dividend patterns of the company. If the dividend increase is above the industry average, it can attract more investors to the stock, potentially driving up its price. Conversely, if the dividend is lower than expected, it may lead to a negative market reaction.Another aspect to consider is how this dividend payment fits into broader market trends. For example, during periods of low-interest rates, dividend-paying stocks can become more attractive to investors seeking income. In contrast, in a high-interest-rate environment, the relative appeal of dividend stocks might decrease as investors have access to other income-generating investments with potentially lower risk.It's also worth noting the market's reaction to the dividend announcement. If the stock price does not change significantly, it may indicate that the dividend was in line with market expectations. Significant price movements could suggest that the market was surprised by the news, either positively or negatively. Economist Dividend distributions can have broader economic implications, especially for companies with a significant market capitalization like Cool Company Ltd. The dividend payment can influence the overall consumer spending, as shareholders might use the extra income for consumption, potentially stimulating the economy. On the other hand, investors might choose to reinvest their dividends, which could have a compounding effect on their investment portfolio and contribute to the overall market liquidity.Additionally, the company's decision to pay dividends can reflect its assessment of the opportunity cost of reinvesting in the business versus returning capital to shareholders. In a robust economic climate with numerous investment opportunities, companies might opt to reinvest profits for growth rather than pay out dividends. Conversely, in a slower economic environment or when fewer attractive investment opportunities are available, companies may increase dividend payouts.The dividend announcement could also impact the currency markets, particularly for a company like Cool Company Ltd, which is listed on multiple exchanges, including the NYSE and the Oslo Stock Exchange. Investors and currency traders may watch for shifts in investment flows that could arise from international investors seeking to capitalize on the dividend payment, potentially affecting the demand for the respective currencies. 03/08/2024 - 01:00 AM HAMILTON, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The shares in Cool Company Ltd. (NYSE: CLCO / CLCO.OL) will be traded ex dividend of $0.41 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023 as of today, March 8, 2024.

(NYSE American: SCPX) announced the pricing of a public offering of 10,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.15 per share, generating $1,500,000 in gross proceeds. The offering is expected to close on March 12, 2024, with net proceeds intended for working capital and general corporate purposes.","Scorpius Holdings, Inc. Announces Pricing of Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Scorpius Holdings, Inc. (NYSE American: SCPX) announced the pricing of a public offering of 10,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.15 per share, generating $1,500,000 in gross proceeds. The offering is expected to close on March 12, 2024, with net proceeds intended for working capital and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Scorpius Holdings, Inc.'s decision to price its public offering at $0.15 per share for a total of 10 million shares is indicative of the company's need to raise capital, likely to fund operations and maintain liquidity. The aggregate gross proceeds of $1.5 million, before expenses, suggest a relatively small scale of operation, considering the typical size of capital raises in the biotech and pharmaceutical CDMO sector. The pricing of the offering below market value can often lead to immediate dilution of existing shareholders' equity, a factor that investors must weigh against the potential benefits of the capital infusion.Furthermore, the use of net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes is standard, yet it provides limited insight into the company's strategic growth initiatives or debt reduction plans. Investors might question the long-term value creation from such a capital raise, especially if the company does not have a clear roadmap for revenue generation or cost reduction. The involvement of ThinkEquity as the sole book-running manager also suggests a targeted approach to the capital raise, which could either streamline the process or limit the offering's exposure to a broader range of institutional investors. Market Research Analyst Assessing the impact of Scorpius Holdings' public offering on its stock price requires an understanding of the CDMO market dynamics. The sector is known for its capital-intensive nature, with firms often requiring significant investment to expand manufacturing capabilities and adhere to regulatory compliance. The modest size of the offering could signal to the market that Scorpius is in the early stages of growth or potentially facing financial constraints.Moreover, the timing of the offering and the chosen price point might reflect the company's urgent capital needs, possibly due to competitive pressures or an immediate requirement for operational funding. Investors and analysts will closely monitor the stock's performance post-offering, as it can serve as a barometer for market confidence in the company's future prospects. It is also crucial to consider the broader industry trends, such as M&A activities, technological advancements and regulatory changes, which could influence Scorpius' position in the market and its ability to capitalize on the raised funds effectively. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding Scorpius Holdings' offering is grounded in its compliance with SEC regulations, as evidenced by the use of a shelf registration statement on Form S-3. This type of registration allows for the issuance of securities to the public in multiple tranches over time, providing the company with flexibility in capital raising efforts. The reliance on a written prospectus, both preliminary and final, underscores the importance of transparency and full disclosure to potential investors.It is also noteworthy that the offering's legality is contingent upon adherence to state and jurisdictional securities laws, which can vary and impact the distribution of the offering. The disclaimer in the press release serves as a reminder of the regulatory complexities involved in public offerings and the necessity for compliance to avoid legal repercussions. The legal structure of the offering, if well-executed, can provide Scorpius with a sound framework to secure funding while minimizing legal risks. 03/08/2024 - 12:20 AM DURHAM, N.C., March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Scorpius Holdings, Inc.

It is crucial to assess the dilution effect on current shareholders and the impact on the company's earnings per share (EPS). The additional 30-day option for underwriters to purchase up to 469,565 shares provides a buffer that could stabilize the stock price post-offering, but also introduces the possibility of further dilution.Given that Nayax will not receive proceeds from the selling shareholders' portion, the net capital inflow will be limited to the new shares issued. Investors should scrutinize the intended use of these proceeds, as they often fund growth initiatives or debt reduction. The involvement of reputable financial institutions as book-running managers and distributors suggests confidence in the offering's success, though it does not guarantee market performance. The timing of the offering's closure, set for March 12, 2024, will be a key date for stakeholders to monitor. Market Research Analyst Nayax's public offering occurs within the context of a global commerce enablement and payment solutions market that is becoming increasingly competitive. The company's positioning as a platform designed to help merchants scale their business is significant, as it taps into the broader trend of digital transformation in commerce. It is essential to evaluate how this capital raise might bolster Nayax's competitive edge, possibly through technology advancements or market expansion.Furthermore, the decision by key executives and board members to sell a portion of their shares could be interpreted in various ways by the market. While it might raise questions about their confidence in the long-term prospects of the company, it could also be a typical liquidity event. The market's response to this news will be telling of investor sentiment towards Nayax's growth trajectory and governance. Legal Expert Compliance with the Securities Act of 1933 is a fundamental aspect of this offering, as evidenced by the effective registration statement with the SEC. The role of Phoenix and Active as distributors in Israel, explicitly not making offers or sales in the United States, highlights the regulatory complexities of international securities offerings. Prospective investors should be aware of the legal frameworks governing their investments, particularly in cross-border transactions.The clear statement that this press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy ensures adherence to SEC regulations regarding communication. This also serves as a reminder to stakeholders of the importance of the final prospectus supplement, which will provide detailed information about the offering and should be reviewed thoroughly for risk factors and financials before making any investment decisions. 03/07/2024 - 09:26 PM HERZLIYA, Israel, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nayax Ltd.

Negative None. 03/07/2024 - 11:01 PM Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - March 7, 2024) - CGX Energy Inc. (TSXV: OYL) (""CGX"" or the ""Company"") announced today the release of its audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, together with its Management Discussion and Analysis (the ""Financial Disclosures""). These Financial Disclosures will be posted on the Company's website at www.cgxenergy.com and on SEDAR at www.sedarplus.ca. All values in the Financial Disclosures are in United States dollars unless otherwise stated.Company Highlights:Wei-1 Well StatusAs previously disclosed, the Wei-1 well was drilled by the Company and Frontera Energy Corporation (""Frontera""), joint venture partners (the ""Joint Venture""). On June 11, 2023, the Company reached a significant milestone with the Wei-1 well, achieving a depth of 20,450 feet. Subsequently, wireline logging operations were successfully completed by June 23, 2023, and operations related to Wei-1 concluded by July 5, 2023, resulting in the release of the drilling rig.During the drilling process, the Wei-1 well encountered multiple oil-bearing intervals in the northern part of the Corentyne block. These formations span various geological ages, including Maastrichtian, Campanian, and Santonian. Notable findings include the presence of medium sweet crude oil with an API of 24.9 in the Maastrichtian interval. The Campanian interval confirmed the presence of moveable hydrocarbons through downhole fluid analysis.The Joint Venture believes that the rock quality discovered in the Maastrichtian horizon in the Wei-1 well is analogous to that reported in the Liza Discovery on Stabroek block. Results further demonstrate the potential for a standalone shallow oil resource development across the Corentyne block. The Joint Venture has discovered 228 feet of net pay in Kawa-1 and 114 feet of net pay in Wei-1, as summarized below:Feet of Net PayWei-1Kawa-1Maastrichtian1368Campanian6166Santonian4076Coniacian*-18Total Net Pay114228 * Coniacian targeted in Kawa-1 well only.An independent third-party laboratory conducted an analysis of the rock and fluid properties of the Campanian and Santonian intervals in the fourth quarter of 2023. This data showed low permeabilities in the Kawa-1 and Wei-1 penetrations.The Joint Venture believes that approximately 514 to 628 mmboe PMean unrisked gross prospective resources may be present in the Maastrichtian horizons alone and that additional potential upside may exist in the deeper Campanian and Santonian horizons. The Joint Venture believes the Maastrichtian has the potential for a stand-alone commercial development, with potential upside in the deeper zones.2023 Joint Operating Agreement AmendmentOn August 9, 2023, CGX Resources Inc. (""CRI"") and Frontera Energy Guyana Corp (""Frontera Guyana"") a wholly-owned subsidiary of Frontera, entered into an agreement to further amend the joint operation agreement (""JOA"") dated January 30, 2019 and subsequently amended (the ""2023 JOA Amendment"").Pursuant to the 2023 JOA Amendment, the Company agreed to transfer an additional 4.7% participating interest in the Corentyne block to Frontera Guyana, in exchange for Frontera Guyana funding CGX's participating interest share of the costs associated with the Wei-1 well for up to approximately $16.5 million.Pursuant to the 2023 JOA Amendment, if the final amount paid by Frontera Guyana as a carry towards CGX's participating interest share of Wei-1 expenses is less than $16.5 million, the Company has the right to receive from Frontera Guyana a re-assignment of a portion of said 4.7% interest equivalent to the portion of the consideration that is not used towards the payment of CGX's participating interest share of costs associated with the Wei-1 well. The 2023 JOA Amendment was completed during the fourth quarter of 2023, pending approval from the Government of Guyana.According to the final cost of the Wei-1 well, the Company would have the right to receive from Frontera Guyana a reassignment of 0.78% participating interest in the Corentyne block. However, pursuant to that certain Closing Letter dated March 7, 2024 (""Closing Letter"") between the Company and Frontera Guyana, the Company has instead agreed to receive from Frontera Guyana (i) the re-assignment of a 0.18% participating interest in the Corentyne block, (ii) $1.5 million cash consideration to cover certain other operating expenses of the Company, and (iii) $0.6 million in settlement of other accounts payable related to the Joint Operations.Pursuant to the 2023 JOA Amending Agreement, and the Closing Letter, the Company holds a 27.48% working interest in the block, and Frontera Guyana holds the remaining 72.52% working interest in the block.Houlihan Lokey Supporting Active Pursuit of Strategic Options for Corentyne BlockHoulihan Lokey, a leading global investment bank and capital markets expert, is supporting active pursuit of strategic options for the Corentyne block, including a potential farm down, as it seeks to develop this potentially transformational oil investment in one of the most attractive oil and gas destinations in the world today, Guyana. A data room has been opened and management presentations are underway There can be no guarantee that the review of strategic options will result in a transaction.Berbice Deep Water PortThe in-river construction of the 50 x 12 m access trestle built from the quayside yard westward into the Berbice river has been completed on budget and with no HSE related incidents. The Berbice Deep Water Port (""BDWP"") facility intends to serve as an offshore supply base for the oil and gas industry and as a multipurpose terminal to service agricultural import and export, containerized and specialized cargo including aggregates for construction purposes.The announcement of significant infrastructure projects in Region 6 by the Government of Guyana motivates the completion of the cargo aspects of the Port earlier, especially with respect to the handling of aggregates and other construction materials which must be imported into the region from elsewhere in the country and offshore. Initial cargo operations at the port is expected to commence in the second quarter 2024, projected based on expressed interest from third parties to utilize the Port for the importation and storage of aggregates. The port will be capable of loading and offloading barges, mainly aggregates, from the completed trestle, as well as the storage of material at the completed port yard. This will require the construction of a ramp to access the trestle as well as the installation of mooring piles at the trestle to aid in bringing barges alongside. Operation of the full cargo terminal aspects of the port is forecasted for the end of 2024 and operation of oil and gas support is forecasted for 2025, subject to construction schedules, financing, and supply chains.

TCAR is a minimally invasive surgical procedure to treat carotid artery disease, reducing the risk of stroke and improving outcomes. The partnership aims to provide comprehensive solutions to patients in China, where stroke is a major health concern. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The exclusive distribution agreement between Silk Road Medical and Genesis MedTech Group to introduce TCAR products in China is a strategic move with potential to significantly impact the healthcare landscape. TCAR, being a minimally invasive procedure, presents a lower risk alternative to traditional carotid artery disease treatments, such as Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA) and Transfemoral Carotid Artery Stenting (TFCAS). The introduction of this technology is particularly relevant in China, where stroke is the leading cause of death and disability and there is a high prevalence of ischemic strokes caused by carotid artery disease.From a medical research perspective, the data indicating over 85,000 TCAR procedures in the United States underscores the procedure's acceptance and growth potential. The clinical benefits of TCAR, which include reduced risk of stroke, myocardial infarction and cranial nerve injury, align with the global healthcare shift towards less invasive treatments with better patient outcomes. As the Chinese population ages, the demand for effective stroke prevention strategies will likely increase, positioning TCAR as a potentially transformative option within the country's healthcare system. Market Research Analyst Exploring the commercial implications, Silk Road Medical's expansion into the Chinese market through this distribution agreement taps into a significant patient population. Given the scale of the Chinese healthcare market and the high incidence of stroke, the potential customer base for TCAR products is substantial. The partnership with Genesis MedTech, which has an established distribution network, is a strategic move that could accelerate market penetration and adoption of the ENROUTE systems in China.Furthermore, the medical device sector in China is growing rapidly, fueled by both domestic innovation and international partnerships. Silk Road Medical's entry into this market with a cutting-edge treatment option could enhance its competitive positioning and potentially increase its market share. The market's response to the TCAR products will depend on factors such as pricing, reimbursement policies and the ability of the companies to navigate regulatory challenges. However, the partnership's success could serve as a case study for other medical device companies looking to enter or expand in the Chinese market. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the distribution agreement could have a positive impact on Silk Road Medical's revenue growth, given the size and growth potential of the Chinese medical device market. The ability to tap into a market where there is a high incidence of the condition that TCAR treats represents a significant opportunity for revenue expansion. The long-term financial success of the agreement will depend on the adoption rate of TCAR in China, which could be influenced by factors such as the effectiveness of the commercial team, the training of physicians and patient outcomes compared to traditional treatments.Investors should monitor the roll-out of the TCAR products in China, considering the potential increase in Silk Road Medical's global footprint and diversification of revenue streams. While the initial investment and costs associated with market entry and scaling operations could affect short-term financials, the long-term growth potential in a market with high demand for stroke prevention solutions could be substantial. The company’s stock performance could reflect the market's perception of the deal's potential and its execution. 03/07/2024 - 09:00 PM WUXI, China, March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Silk Road Medical (NASDAQ: SILK), a medical device company based in California USA and Genesis MedTech Group have signed an exclusive distribution agreement to introduce the TCAR® core products, ENROUTE® Transcarotid Neuroprotection System and ENROUTE® Transcarotid Stent System, in China. TCAR (Transcarotid Artery Revascularization) is an innovative minimally invasive surgical procedure used to treat carotid artery disease, a condition characterized by the narrowing or blockage of the carotid arteries in the neck. This narrowing or blockage can restrict blood flow to the brain and increase the risk of stroke. Since its establishment in 2019, Genesis MedTech Group has continuously strived to enhance its peripheral interventional portfolio, offering comprehensive solutions to both physicians and patients. Through its commercial team and distribution network, patients in China will now have access to the core TCAR products, the ENROUTE® Neuroprotection System and Stent Delivery System. TCAR has shown to reduce the risk of stroke, death, myocardial infraction (MI), and Cranial Nerve Injury (CNI). It is a less invasive procedure with lower rates of procedural complications and an overall improvement in outcomes, contributing to a positive impact on healthcare. Carotid artery disease often occurs in the middle-aged and elderly population, especially among those with atherosclerosis. The condition is characterized by the buildup of plaque, and over time can cause narrowing or blockage of the carotid arteries, affecting blood supply to the brain and leading to diseases such as ischemic stroke. In recent years, stroke has become the second leading cause of mortality worldwide. In China, it now ranks as the primary cause of death and disability. Each year, over 17 million strokes affect individuals over 40 years old. Notably, around one third of ischemic strokes are caused by carotid artery disease. In the United States, TCAR is rapidly replacing traditional procedures. As of the end of 2023, over 85,000 TCAR procedures have been performed. Before the introduction of TCAR, moderate to severe carotid artery disease was generally treated clinically with two surgical methods: Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA) and Transfemoral Carotid Artery Stenting (TFCAS). However, CEA involves a large incision and carries a higher risk of complications, posing a risk of damage to the cranial nerves of patients. Studies have also shown a higher risk of stroke during TFCAS as compared to TCAR and CEA. Based on clinical studies, TCAR is an advancement in the management of carotid artery disease. Professor Chen Zhong, Chairman, Vascular Surgery Group of Chinese Medical Association, President, Vascular Surgery Physicians Branch of Chinese Medical Doctor Association and Chief Physician, Vascular Surgery at Beijing Anzhen Hospital, commented, ""There is considerable evidence showing that TCAR offers advantages for patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis or those at anatomical or surgical risk."" Silk Road Medical's CEO, Chas McKhann stated, ""This agreement represents a promising initial step towards expanding the reach of the TCAR therapy with the offering of our ENROUTE Neuroprotection System and Stent Delivery System to more patients worldwide, including those in China. We are very pleased to have partnered with Genesis MedTech, a respected leader in medtech, who shares our vision for the potential impact of TCAR in preventing strokes."" ""Enabling TCAR to be made accessible to the patients in China certainly marks another milestone in our efforts to bring innovative treatments to our patients. Together with Silk Road Medical, we remain dedicated to make better healthcare more accessible, improving patient care and outcomes."" shared Warren Wang, Genesis MedTech Group's Chairman and CEO.

However, investors should be cautious about potential dilution of their holdings. The additional capital may fuel growth or operational expansions, but it's critical to evaluate the company's past capital allocation efficiency to gauge future expectations. Market Research Analyst The oil and gas sector is highly volatile, with prices influenced by geopolitical events, regulatory changes and shifts in supply and demand. Empire's decision to raise capital through a Rights Offering should be viewed in the context of the industry's capital-intensive nature. The infusion of $25 million could enable Empire to invest in new technologies, secure additional assets, or pay down debt, which could enhance its competitive position.It is also important to note the non-transferability of the rights and the absence of their trading on stock exchanges. This approach can limit liquidity for the rights but may also prevent speculative trading that could lead to price volatility. Investors should monitor the uptake of the Rights Offering and the subsequent use of proceeds for indications of the company's strategic direction and financial health. Legal Expert Empire's Rights Offering is subject to legal and regulatory scrutiny, as indicated by the involvement of the SEC and the necessity of a prospectus supplement. Compliance with securities laws is crucial to avoid legal repercussions and maintain investor trust. The restriction of the sale of securities in certain states until registration or qualification under those states' securities laws is a standard regulatory safeguard.Investors should be aware of the legal framework governing such offerings, including their rights and the company's obligations. The fact that Empire's largest shareholders have indicated their intention to participate fully is a sign of commitment but also raises questions about potential changes in control and influence within the company, which are factors that should be considered from a legal and governance standpoint. 03/07/2024 - 08:51 PM TULSA, Okla., March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Empire Petroleum Corporation (NYSE American: EP) (""Empire"" or the ""Company""), an oil and gas company with current producing assets in New Mexico, North Dakota, Montana, Texas, and Louisiana, announced today that it has commenced its previously announced subscription rights offering (“Rights Offering”) pursuant to which it intends to raise gross proceeds of up to approximately $25.0 million.

Kyverna Therapeutics and Stanford University Agree to Evaluate KYV-101 in Patients with Non-Relapsing and Progressive Forms of Multiple Sclerosis,2024-03-08T00:26:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Kyverna Therapeutics collaborates with Stanford University to conduct a phase 1 investigator-initiated trial for KYV-101, an anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, in multiple sclerosis patients, aiming to assess safety, feasibility, and tolerance.","Kyverna Therapeutics and Stanford University Agree to Evaluate KYV-101 in Patients with Non-Relapsing and Progressive Forms of Multiple Sclerosis Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Kyverna Therapeutics collaborates with Stanford University to conduct a phase 1 investigator-initiated trial for KYV-101, an anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, in multiple sclerosis patients, aiming to assess safety, feasibility, and tolerance. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The initiation of a phase 1 trial for KYV-101 in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients represents a significant step in the application of CAR T-cell therapy beyond oncology. Historically, CAR T-cell therapies have been used in the treatment of certain cancers, but their potential in autoimmune diseases like MS is now being explored. This shift from oncology to autoimmune diseases could signal a new therapeutic frontier, potentially increasing the addressable market for such treatments.From a research perspective, the collaboration with Stanford University is poised to enhance the understanding of disease biology in MS and may identify biomarkers predictive of treatment response. Such biomarkers are crucial for personalizing treatment, thereby improving outcomes and reducing unnecessary exposure to potentially harmful therapies for non-responders.However, it is essential to consider that early-phase trials primarily focus on safety and tolerability and efficacy data, which is critical for regulatory approval and market adoption, will not be available until later-phase trials. The outcome of this study could impact Kyverna Therapeutics' stock, especially if the results are positive and indicate a viable pathway for treating MS with KYV-101. Biotech Financial Analyst The initiation of this trial is likely to be seen as a positive development by investors, as it reflects progress in the company's pipeline and the expansion of its therapeutic reach. The involvement of a prestigious institution like Stanford University may also lend additional credibility and visibility to Kyverna's efforts.Investors will be particularly interested in the potential for KYV-101 to address a significant unmet medical need in non-relapsing multiple sclerosis. The success of KYV-101 could open up a new revenue stream for Kyverna. However, the costs associated with research and development, as well as the long timeline until potential commercialization, must be weighed against the current and projected cash flow of the company.It's also worth noting that the biotech sector is highly volatile and the success of early-stage trials does not guarantee future success. Nonetheless, diversifying the application of CAR T-cell therapy could mitigate some of the risks associated with a pipeline concentrated in oncology. Healthcare Economist The economic implications of extending CAR T-cell therapies to autoimmune diseases could be substantial. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic condition that requires lifelong management, often involving expensive treatments. If KYV-101 proves to be safe and effective, it could potentially reduce the long-term healthcare costs associated with managing MS by offering a more definitive treatment option.Moreover, the healthcare system could benefit from a reduction in the indirect costs associated with MS, such as lost productivity and disability. However, the high initial costs of CAR T-cell therapies could pose challenges for payer acceptance and patient access. It will be crucial to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of KYV-101 compared to existing therapies, considering both the direct and indirect costs of MS. 03/07/2024 - 07:26 PM The Investigator-Initiated Trial will assess the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of KYV-101, a fully human anti CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in up to 12 study participants The clinical study will be supported by cutting edge correlative studies funded through a parallel research collaboration between Kyverna and Stanford University The agreements further expand the scale of ongoing clinical studies assessing the potential therapeutic effects of KYV-101 in multiple diseases and locations around the world EMERYVILLE, Calif., March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Kyverna Therapeutics, Inc. (Kyverna), a patient-centered, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing cell therapies for patients suffering from autoimmune diseases, today announced the signature of a collaboration agreement with Stanford University to allow the use of KYV-101, an investigational, anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in an open label, phase 1 investigator-initiated trial (IIT) in nine to twelve adult subjects with non-relapsing and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis. Each participant will receive a single dose of KYV-101. A parallel agreement will support the development of correlative studies thoroughly investigating disease biology upon KYV-101 infusion in MS patients, including the definition of predictors of response and the potential for immune reset. The investigator-initiated trial adds to the Kyverna-sponsored KYSA-7 Phase 2 study in MS and other sponsored KYSA trials in other rheumatological and neurological autoimmune disorders. ""We foresee great therapeutic potential for CAR T-cell therapy for immune-mediated disease of the nervous system. This phase 1 trial is a first-in-human study that will assess safety, feasibility, and tolerance in patients with non-relapsing multiple sclerosis for which there is no proven treatment,"" said Jeffrey Dunn, M.D., the Lily Sarafan director of Neuroimmunology and clinical professor and chief of Neuroimmunology within the Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. ""We are grateful for the opportunity to join forces with Kyverna to explore what may prove to be paradigm-changing immunotherapy."". ""As CAR T-cell therapies are entering the field of B cell-driven autoimmunity, leveraging on our knowledge and expertise in oncology will provide a faster option to address an unmet medical need and make these potentially life-changing therapies available to non-cancer patients,"" said Robert Lowsky, M.D., professor of medicine, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. ""We are excited about the interest shown by world-class institutions like Stanford to evaluate the clinical performance of KYV-101 in patients suffering from multiple sclerosis,"" said Peter Maag, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Kyverna. ""We look forward to enriching our collective knowledge about the potential paradigm-shifting value of CAR T-cell therapy through these dedicated collaborations between Industry and Academia."" CAR T-cell therapy involves modifying a patient's T cells to recognize and remove B cells in the patient's body. Kyverna's CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, KYV-101, specifically targets CD19, a protein expressed on the surface of B cells, which are involved in various types of autoimmune diseases. Kyverna plans to continue to explore additional indications for KYV-101 and develop a robust pipeline of promising product candidate immunotherapies aimed at addressing unmet medical needs in autoimmune diseases. About Multiple sclerosis (MS)Multiple sclerosis is a chronic neurodegenerative autoimmune disease affecting over 2.8 million individuals worldwide1. It affects more frequently women, people of Northern European descent, and is also associated with certain environmental and genetic factors. Patients with MS can experience a range of symptoms including blurred vision, slurred speech, tremors, numbness, extreme fatigue, problems with memory and concentration, and, in severe cases, the inability to walk or stand.Current disease-modifying treatments for MS aim to reduce the frequency of disease relapses and delay progression of disability, but the disease remains a chronic condition that will progressively worsen for most patients. About KYV-101KYV-101 is an autologous, fully human CD19 CAR T-cell product candidate for use in B cell-driven autoimmune diseases. The CAR in KYV-101 was designed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to improve tolerability and tested in a 20-patient Phase 1 trial in oncology. Results were published by the NIH in Nature Medicine2. KYV-101 is currently being evaluated in sponsored, open-label trials of KYV-101 in patients with lupus nephritis, an autoimmune disease in which more than half of patients do not achieve a complete response to current therapies and are at risk of developing kidney failure. Additionally, FDA's IND clearance has been obtained for Phase 2 trials of KYV-101 for multiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis, and a Phase 1/2 trial for systemic sclerosis. We believe that the differentiated properties of KYV-101 are critical for the potential success of CAR T cells as autoimmune disease therapies. KYV-101 is also being evaluated in investigator-initiated trials for multiple indications in multiple geographies. About Kyverna Therapeutics Kyverna Therapeutics (NASDAQ: KYTX) is a patient-centered, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing cell therapies for patients suffering from autoimmune diseases. Our lead CAR T-cell therapy candidate, KYV-101 is advancing through clinical development with sponsored clinical trials across two broad areas of autoimmune disease: rheumatology and neurology, including Phase 2 trials for multiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis, a Phase 1/2 trial for systemic sclerosis, and two ongoing multi-center, open-label Phase 1 trials in the United States and Germany for patients with lupus nephritis. Kyverna's pipeline includes next-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies in both autologous and allogeneic formats with properties intended to be well suited for use in B cell-driven autoimmune diseases. By advancing more than one mechanism for taming autoimmunity, Kyverna is positioned to act on its mission of transforming how autoimmune diseases are treated.

Financial Analyst Delek Logistics Partners, LP's announcement of a public offering of over 3 million common units at $38.50 each represents a significant capital influx for the company. The decision to use the net proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit agreement suggests a strategic move to improve the company's balance sheet and reduce interest expenses. This action could potentially enhance Delek Logistics' financial flexibility and creditworthiness, which may be viewed favorably by investors and credit rating agencies. However, the dilution of Delek US Holdings, Inc.'s ownership from 78.7% to approximately 73.4% indicates a redistribution of equity that may affect control dynamics and dividend distributions. Market Research Analyst The offering price of $38.50 per unit provides a snapshot of the market's current valuation of Delek Logistics' common units. It is essential to compare this pricing with the historical performance, peer valuations and industry benchmarks to assess market sentiment. The fact that the offering is being made pursuant to a shelf registration statement indicates a pre-planned financing strategy, allowing for a faster response to market conditions.

The offering is anticipated to close shortly, providing RadNet with significant funds for its operations. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of RadNet's underwritten public offering at $44.00 per share, aiming to raise approximately $200 million, is a significant capital market event. This influx of capital could be indicative of RadNet's strategic initiatives for expansion or debt reduction. The offering size and pricing suggest investor confidence in RadNet's market position and growth prospects. However, it's crucial to assess the dilutive impact on current shareholders, as the addition of 4,550,000 shares will spread earnings over a larger equity base.It is also important to note the 30-day option granted to underwriters to purchase additional shares. This 'greenshoe' option can stabilize the stock price post-offering, which might be beneficial for both the company and its investors. The use of proceeds is not detailed, which leaves some uncertainty regarding the specific intentions of the company. Investors should monitor how these funds will be allocated to gauge the potential for return on investment. Market Research Analyst RadNet's positioning in the outpatient diagnostic imaging services market is crucial to understanding this public offering's potential impact. The fixed-site outpatient imaging sector is growing due to trends like the shift from inpatient to outpatient care, technological advancements and an aging population. By raising capital, RadNet may be aiming to invest in new technologies, expand its geographic footprint, or acquire smaller competitors, which could increase its market share and competitive edge.However, the market will be observing how effectively RadNet deploys the raised capital. The company's ability to leverage these funds for profitable growth is essential for long-term value creation. Failure to do so could lead to market skepticism and stock underperformance. Additionally, the timing and size of the offering could reflect management's view of the market conditions and their stock's valuation, which could be interpreted as a positive signal if the pricing is perceived to be favorable. Economist From an economic perspective, RadNet's public offering is a microcosmic indicator of broader economic trends. The willingness of the market to absorb a $200 million offering reflects liquidity and investor appetite for healthcare sector investments. This sector often exhibits counter-cyclical characteristics, which means it can maintain stability even during economic downturns due to the essential nature of healthcare services.The pricing of the offering at $44.00 per share provides insights into the perceived value of RadNet's stock and the company's capital structure optimization. The decision to raise equity, as opposed to debt financing, could be influenced by current interest rates and the company's balance sheet considerations. An equity offering, while dilutive, avoids the interest burden of debt and may be preferable if the company anticipates higher borrowing costs or if it aims to maintain a certain debt-to-equity ratio. 03/07/2024 - 09:54 PM LOS ANGELES, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RadNet, Inc.

Vertiv Declares Quarterly Dividend,2024-03-07T21:20:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Vertiv (VRT) declares a quarterly cash dividend of $0.025 per share for Class A common stock, payable on March 28, 2024. The dividend is for shareholders of record as of March 19, 2024.","Vertiv Declares Quarterly Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Vertiv (VRT) declares a quarterly cash dividend of $0.025 per share for Class A common stock, payable on March 28, 2024. The dividend is for shareholders of record as of March 19, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.025 per share by Vertiv indicates a distribution of profits back to shareholders, which is often seen as a positive signal regarding a company's financial health and stability. It reflects the company's ability to generate sufficient cash flow and its commitment to providing shareholder value. Such dividends can also influence the stock's attractiveness to income-focused investors and potentially affect the stock price.Investors should consider the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the stock price. A yield that is too high could suggest that the stock price is low due to underlying problems within the company, whereas a yield that is too low might not be attractive to investors seeking income. Additionally, the payout ratio, which is the percentage of earnings paid to shareholders in dividends, is crucial. A sustainable payout ratio typically ranges from 35% to 55% for healthy companies, allowing for reinvestment in the business while also rewarding shareholders. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the announcement of a dividend can be indicative of a company's sector performance and general market conditions. Companies within a stable and mature industry are more likely to issue regular dividends, as they have consistent revenue streams that allow for predictable cash flow. For Vertiv, operating in the digital infrastructure space, this could suggest a stable demand for their products and services in the market, which is increasingly reliant on digital technology.However, it's important to analyze this dividend declaration in the context of the company's financials and the broader industry trends. Investors should assess whether the dividend is supported by strong fundamentals or if it's a strategy to maintain investor interest despite potential underlying issues. Comparing Vertiv's dividend yield and growth with industry peers can provide additional insights into the company's competitive position and future prospects. Economist Dividend payments can also be reflective of broader economic conditions. In a low-interest-rate environment, dividends become more attractive as they may offer better returns than fixed-income securities like bonds. Conversely, if interest rates are rising, companies might be more cautious with dividend payments due to higher borrowing costs and the increased attractiveness of other investment vehicles.Furthermore, the decision to pay out dividends must be balanced against other uses of capital, such as reinvestment in the business for growth, paying down debt, or stock buybacks. A company's dividend policy can signal its priorities and expectations for future earnings and investment opportunities. In the case of Vertiv, the commitment to a cash dividend could suggest confidence in ongoing operational performance and a balanced approach to capital allocation. 03/07/2024 - 04:20 PM COLUMBUS, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Vertiv (NYSE: VRT), a global provider of critical digital infrastructure and continuity solutions, today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.025 per share of the company’s Class A common stock.

MediaAlpha is not offering any shares in the offering. J.P. Morgan is the sole underwriter. The proceeds will go to the Selling Stockholders. The offering is subject to market conditions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of a secondary public offering by certain selling stockholders of MediaAlpha is a significant event for investors to consider. It involves the sale of 3,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, with an additional option for the underwriter to purchase up to 450,000 more shares. The main point of interest here is that the proceeds from this sale will go entirely to the selling stockholders and not to MediaAlpha itself. This implies that the company will not receive any capital infusion from this transaction to fund its operations or growth initiatives.From a liquidity perspective, the introduction of additional shares into the market could potentially dilute the stock's value in the short term. However, it could also be seen as a vote of confidence if the shares are quickly purchased by investors. The role of J.P. Morgan as the sole underwriter suggests a level of credibility and could facilitate a smoother sale process. The impact on the stock price will depend on the market's perception of the offering's value and the current shareholders' willingness to retain their investment in light of the increased share availability. Market Research Analyst In the context of MediaAlpha's industry, secondary offerings are not uncommon and often reflect the maturation of a company or the desire of early investors to realize gains. It is essential to analyze the timing of this offering and its alignment with MediaAlpha's strategic goals. If the market perceives the sale as a move by insiders to exit at a peak, this could negatively affect investor sentiment. Conversely, if the selling stockholders are diversifying their portfolios rather than losing confidence in the company, the long-term impact may be minimal.It's also crucial to consider the broader market conditions. If the industry is experiencing growth, the additional shares might be absorbed without much disruption. However, in a bear market or when the sector is facing headwinds, the offering could contribute to downward pressure on the stock price. Investors would do well to monitor the performance of MediaAlpha's peers and the demand for shares in similar offerings to gauge the potential success of this transaction. Legal Expert The legal aspect of a secondary public offering involves a thorough review of the registration statement and prospectus filed with the SEC. It is important for investors to understand the implications of the terms outlined in these documents. For instance, the underwriter's right to reject orders could influence the distribution of shares and potentially impact the market. Any discrepancies or unusual terms in the offering could raise red flags and warrant closer scrutiny.Additionally, it is critical to ensure that all regulatory requirements are met and that the offering complies with securities laws. Non-compliance could lead to legal challenges or sanctions that might affect the company's reputation and financial health. Investors should pay attention to the SEC filings for any amendments or additional information that could provide further insights into the offering's structure and the intentions of the selling stockholders. 03/07/2024 - 04:17 PM LOS ANGELES, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MediaAlpha, Inc.

The dividend of $0.69 per share is payable on April 12, 2024, to shareholders of record on March 22, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The authorization of a $5 billion share repurchase program by Medtronic's board is a significant financial move that can have multiple implications for the company's stock. Share repurchases often signal to the market that the company believes its stock is undervalued, providing a vote of confidence that can bolster investor sentiment. By reducing the number of shares outstanding, earnings per share (EPS) may increase, potentially leading to a higher stock price.However, this move also suggests that Medtronic may not have identified investment opportunities within the business that would yield a higher return than the repurchase program. Investors often look favorably upon share repurchase programs as they can increase shareholder value, but they also scrutinize the opportunity cost of such capital allocation decisions. It's important to consider the company's balance sheet strength and whether this repurchase will be financed through cash reserves or debt, as the latter could affect the company's leverage ratios. Market Research Analyst Medtronic's consistent increase in annual dividend payments, now for the 46th consecutive year, places it within the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index, a status that can attract income-focused investors seeking reliable dividend growth. This consistency in rewarding shareholders through dividends can provide a stable flow of income, which is particularly appealing during volatile market conditions.Furthermore, the announcement of share repurchases can be interpreted as a strategic move to manage market expectations and shareholder value. It is essential to analyze how this buyback compares with repurchase activities by other companies in the healthcare sector. If Medtronic's repurchase size or frequency is significantly higher than its peers, it could indicate a more aggressive approach to capital return strategies, which might be a response to sector-specific trends or a company-specific strategy to enhance EPS. Economist From an economic standpoint, the decision by Medtronic to engage in share repurchases must be evaluated in the context of the broader economic environment. In periods of economic expansion, companies may opt to return capital to shareholders as a means of sharing the fruits of growth. Conversely, during economic downturns, such actions might be aimed at shoring up stock prices amidst reduced investor confidence.It's also critical to assess the timing and scale of these repurchases. The absence of a specified time period for the repurchase program provides the company with flexibility to buy back shares at opportune times, potentially maximizing the benefit to shareholders. However, this lack of a timeline can also introduce uncertainty for investors seeking to understand the company's long-term capital allocation strategy. 03/07/2024 - 04:20 PM Board authorizes $5 billion for share repurchases DUBLIN, March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The board of directors of Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT) on Thursday, March 7, 2024, approved the company's cash dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 of $0.69 per ordinary share. This quarterly declaration is consistent with the dividend announcement made by the company in May 2023. Medtronic is a constituent of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index, having increased its annual dividend payment for the past 46 consecutive years. The dividend is payable on April 12, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 22, 2024. In addition to approving the dividend, the board today authorized the expenditure of funds for share repurchases. Given the remaining amount under the board's March 2019 $6.0 billion authorization was $1.9 billion by the end of the last fiscal quarter, the board today authorized an incremental $5.0 billion for share repurchases. The company noted that there is no specific time period associated with today's repurchase authorization. About MedtronicBold thinking. Bolder actions. We are Medtronic.

Announces Proposed Public Offering of Common Stock Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Scorpius Holdings, Inc. (NYSE American: SCPX) plans to offer shares of common stock in a public offering managed by ThinkEquity for working capital and corporate purposes. The offering is made under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Scorpius Holdings, Inc.'s decision to offer shares in an underwritten public offering is a strategic move aimed at raising capital. The infusion of funds through the sale of common stock is typically pursued by companies seeking to bolster their working capital or finance expansion efforts. In this case, the stated use of proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes suggests a focus on strengthening the company's operational foundation rather than earmarking funds for specific growth initiatives or debt reduction.Investors should consider the potential dilutive effect of such an offering on existing shareholders. While the capital raise can provide the company with necessary liquidity, it may also result in earnings per share being spread over a larger number of shares outstanding. The market's reaction to this dilution can vary, potentially impacting the stock price. Additionally, the role of ThinkEquity as the sole book-running manager indicates their responsibility for the underwriting process, which includes determining the final offer price and allocating shares to investors.It is essential to assess the terms of the offering once the preliminary prospectus supplement is filed. Investors should scrutinize the pricing, the number of shares being offered and the overall market conditions at the time of the offering to gauge the potential impact on the company's valuation and stock performance. Market Research Analyst The CDMO (Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization) sector has seen an increase in demand, particularly in the context of pharmaceutical and biotech industry growth. Companies like Scorpius Holdings, Inc. operate in a competitive environment where the ability to quickly adapt and scale operations can be a significant advantage.For stakeholders, the timing and success of the public offering are contingent upon market conditions and investor appetite for CDMO stocks. The industry's performance, driven by factors such as drug development pipelines and regulatory environments, could influence investor sentiment. A robust pipeline of drugs in development stages could signal a steady demand for CDMO services, potentially making Scorpius Holdings' stock more attractive.Analyzing peer companies and industry trends can provide further context to Scorpius Holdings' decision to raise capital. Comparing the company's financial health and growth prospects with its competitors can offer insights into its market positioning and the potential for future growth spurred by the capital raise. Legal Expert The offering's reliance on a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC underscores the importance of regulatory compliance in such capital-raising activities. A shelf registration allows a company to prepare and file the necessary paperwork in advance and then offer securities over a period of up to three years. The effectiveness of the registration statement and the requirement for a prospectus supplement to describe the specific details of the offering are critical legal steps to ensure transparency and protect investors.Prospective investors are advised to review the preliminary prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus, along with other incorporated SEC filings, to understand fully the terms of the offering and the company's financial position. These documents contain vital information about the company's operations, financial statements and risk factors associated with the investment.It is also worth noting the legal obligations of ThinkEquity as the book-running manager, including due diligence to verify the information in the registration statement and prospectus, which helps maintain market integrity and investor confidence. 03/07/2024 - 04:18 PM DURHAM, N.C., March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Scorpius Holdings, Inc.

Gold prices hit a new all-time high, benefiting the gold mining industry. U.S. Global Investors' smart beta thematic funds focus on gold-related investments, using a quantitative approach to screen companies. Negative None. Financial Analyst The buyback of shares by U.S. Global Investors signifies a strategic use of capital with the intention to create shareholder value. A share repurchase typically indicates that the company believes its stock is undervalued and is a positive signal to the market. The substantial increase in the number of shares repurchased compared to the previous year suggests a strong confidence in the company's financial health and future prospects. Analyzing the financial implications, the buyback could potentially lead to earnings per share (EPS) accretion, as fewer shares outstanding may result in higher EPS if net income remains stable or grows.Moreover, the continuation of monthly dividends indicates a commitment to returning value to shareholders. The annualized dividend yield of 3.45% is competitive, particularly when compared to the yield on the 10-year Treasury, highlighting the attractiveness of the stock to income-focused investors. However, investors should consider the sustainability of these dividends in relation to the company's earnings and cash flow. Market Research Analyst The mention of gold reaching a new all-time high is a significant factor for U.S. Global Investors, especially given their specialized sector focus. Gold prices are often seen as a safe-haven asset in times of economic uncertainty and can inversely correlate with real interest rates. Expectations that the Federal Reserve may ease monetary policy could decrease real interest rates, making gold more attractive. This scenario could benefit the company's gold-related funds, particularly the gold royalty and streaming ETF, which is likely to see an increase in valuation and interest from investors seeking exposure to precious metals.The company's Smart Beta 2.0 thematic funds strategy is noteworthy as it merges passive and active investment approaches. By not solely relying on market capitalization for company ranking, the strategy aims to identify undervalued companies with strong financial metrics, potentially offering a more robust investment thesis than traditional index funds. 03/07/2024 - 04:19 PM San Antonio, TX, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- U.S. Global Investors, Inc. (NASDAQ: GROW) (the “Company”), a registered investment advisory firm with longstanding experience in global markets and specialized sectors, today is pleased to announce that it repurchased 102,636 of its own shares in February 2024, at a net cost of approximately $281,000. This represents a substantial increase of nearly 200% from the number of shares purchased the same month a year earlier. As a reminder, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) modified the Company’s buyback program in February 2022, increasing the annual limit from $2.75 million to $5 million. Since March 2022, the Company has bought back around 1 million of its shares. “U.S. Global Investors is committed to enhancing shareholder value, and buying back our own stock is just one way that demonstrates our strategic approach to capital allocation. It also showcases our confidence in the Company’s future prospects,” says Frank Holmes, the Company’s CEO and Chief Investment Officer. “We believe GROW is deeply undervalued right now, and we will continue buying as small-cap stocks remain under pressure from higher borrowing costs.” Continuation of Monthly GROW Dividends The Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved payment of the $0.0075 per share per month dividend beginning in April 2024 and continuing through June 2024. The record dates are April 8, May 6 and June 10, and the payment dates will be April 22, May 20 and June 24. At the February 29, closing price of $2.61, the $0.0075 monthly dividend equals a 3.45% yield on an annualized basis. For the 12 months ended December 29, 2023, the Company’s total shareholder yield was approximately 7.9%, which was more than twice the yield on the 10-year Treasury that same day.[1] “We maintain a high conviction in sharing own shareholder yield because we believe focusing on dividends or buybacks alone fails to give investors the full picture,” says Mr. Holmes. “I urge readers interested in learning more to check out Mebane Faber, co-founder of Cambria Investment Management and author of Shareholder Yield: A Better Approach to Dividend Investing. A strong advocate for shareholder yield, Faber has shown numerous times that the strategy works in multiple industries.” Gold at New All-Time High The Company is also pleased to report that the price of gold has recorded a new record high in intraday trading as of March 5, 2024, on investor hopes that the Federal Reserve may begin easing monetary policy later this year. “This is very constructive news for the gold mining industry, which will see higher revenues as a result of these prices,” says Mr. Holmes. Gaining Exposure with Smart Beta 2.0 Thematic Funds U.S. Global Investors is a pioneer in the gold industry, launching the very first no-load gold mutual fund in 1974. The Company currently offers two gold-related mutual funds and one exchange-traded fund focused on precious metal mining. “The run-up in gold is specifically beneficial to our gold royalty and streaming ETF, since it focuses on companies that generate over 50% of their revenue from precious metals. Our smart-beta 2.0 approach allows us to combine the advantages of passive investing and those of active investing,” says Mr. Holmes. “Instead of ranking companies by market capitalization, we take a more quantitative approach, screening for key financial factors.” About U.S. Global Investors, Inc.

The offering aims to repay existing senior exchange notes and senior notes due in 2024. Various prominent financial institutions are involved in managing the offering. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The pricing of a substantial public offering of senior unsecured notes by VICI Properties Inc. represents a strategic financial maneuver aimed at optimizing the company's capital structure. By issuing $1.05 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes with varying maturities, the company is signaling a proactive approach to managing its debt obligations. The decision to use the net proceeds to repay existing senior exchange notes and senior notes due in 2024 indicates a refinancing strategy to take advantage of current market conditions, potentially reducing interest expenses and extending debt maturities.From an investment standpoint, the issuance of notes with higher interest rates compared to the notes being repaid could suggest an anticipation of rising interest rates or a perceived increase in credit risk. The pricing below par value for both the 2034 and 2054 Notes further underscores this point. Investors and analysts will be closely monitoring the yield spread between these newly issued notes and benchmark securities to gauge market sentiment towards the company's creditworthiness.Moreover, the involvement of a syndicate of well-known financial institutions as joint book-running managers and co-managers could enhance investor confidence in the offering, given their role in underwriting and distributing the notes. Debt Capital Markets Expert The structure of VICI Properties' note offering, which includes long-dated maturities of 10 and 30 years, is indicative of the company's long-term financing strategy. Such maturities provide the company with a stable, long-term source of capital, which is particularly beneficial for a real estate investment trust (REIT) given the nature of their long-term property investments. The issuance of senior unsecured notes also implies that these debt instruments are not backed by specific collateral, which may appeal to investors seeking higher yields in exchange for a higher risk profile.However, the pricing of these notes at a discount to par value raises the cost of borrowing for the company, which could impact its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). This is a crucial metric for REITs, as it affects their ability to generate returns on investments above their cost of capital. The interest rates set for the 2034 and 2054 Notes, at 5.750% and 6.125% respectively, are relatively high in the current market environment, reflecting the inherent risks associated with the real estate sector and the issuer's credit profile. Real Estate Investment Trust Analyst The real estate investment sector, where VICI Properties operates, typically requires significant capital for property acquisition and development. By issuing senior unsecured notes, VICI Properties is likely seeking to maintain liquidity and fund ongoing operations without diluting shareholder equity. The choice to repay existing debt with the proceeds can be seen as an effort to improve the company's debt maturity profile and reduce the risk of refinancing under potentially less favorable conditions in the future.Investors in the REIT space often scrutinize the debt-to-equity ratio and interest coverage ratios as indicators of financial health. By addressing near-term debt maturities, VICI Properties may be aiming to present a stronger balance sheet, which could positively influence its stock performance and ability to raise capital in the future. The terms of the offering will also affect the company's financial flexibility, as higher interest rates on long-term debt could constrain future capital expenditure and acquisition strategies. 03/07/2024 - 04:20 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- VICI Properties Inc.

Financial Analyst The declaration of a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.415 per share by VICI Properties Inc. is a clear signal of the company's current financial health and its ability to generate sufficient cash flow. Dividends are typically a distribution of profits to shareholders and can be indicative of a company's confidence in its ongoing profitability and stability. This move may positively influence investor sentiment as it reflects a commitment to returning value to shareholders.Moreover, the consistency of the dividend payout can be appealing to income-focused investors who look for stable dividend-paying stocks to add to their portfolios. It's important to analyze the payout ratio to ensure that the dividends are sustainable and not compromising the company's growth prospects or ability to invest in future opportunities. Market Research Analyst The announcement of a dividend payment can also have implications for the stock's performance in the market. Dividend payments often attract a specific investor base that prioritizes steady income streams. The ex-dividend date, which is set prior to the record date of March 21, 2024, is also crucial for investors to note as it determines eligibility for receiving the dividend. The stock price might see increased activity as the ex-dividend date approaches, as investors position themselves to capture the dividend payout.It is also vital to consider the yield, which is the dividend expressed as a percentage of the current share price. The yield can influence investment decisions, especially when compared to the yields offered by other companies in the real estate sector and broader market indices. Real Estate Investment Trust Analyst As a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), VICI Properties is required by law to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends. This regulatory requirement ensures that a significant portion of earnings is returned to investors, making REITs attractive to those seeking regular income. The size and frequency of the dividend can be a barometer for the performance of the underlying real estate assets and the management's ability to effectively generate and manage rental income.Analysts in this field would scrutinize the dividend coverage ratio, which is a measure of a REIT's ability to pay dividends out of its funds from operations (FFO). A strong coverage ratio would indicate a healthy margin of safety for the dividend payments, while a lower ratio might signal potential cash flow issues that could affect future dividends. 03/07/2024 - 04:17 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- VICI Properties Inc.

Ellington Financial Declares Common and Preferred Dividends,2024-03-07T21:17:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Ellington Financial Inc. (EFC) declares dividends for common and preferred stockholders, including monthly and quarterly payments on various series of preferred stock.","Ellington Financial Declares Common and Preferred Dividends Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Ellington Financial Inc. (EFC) declares dividends for common and preferred stockholders, including monthly and quarterly payments on various series of preferred stock. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Ellington Financial Inc.'s announcement of dividends across various series of stock indicates a distribution of profits back to shareholders, which is a fundamental aspect of shareholder value. The declaration of both monthly and quarterly dividends suggests a stable and predictable income stream for investors, which is often attractive to income-focused portfolios. The varied rates of dividends, corresponding to different series of preferred stock, reflect contractual obligations and the differing levels of risk associated with each series. It's important to note that preferred stocks typically have fixed dividends and are senior to common stock in terms of payout structure.Investors often view regular dividend payments as a sign of a company's financial health and its management's confidence in ongoing profitability. However, it's essential to consider the payout ratio—the percentage of earnings paid out as dividends—to assess sustainability. A payout ratio that is too high could indicate that the company is not reinvesting enough back into its operations, which might affect long-term growth. On the other hand, a moderate payout ratio could signify a balanced approach between rewarding shareholders and funding future growth. Market Research Analyst The announcement of these dividends should be considered in the context of the broader financial sector and the current interest rate environment. Fixed-to-floating and fixed-rate reset preferred stocks, such as Series A and Series C from Ellington Financial, offer investors protection against rising interest rates, as the dividend rates can adjust after a certain period. This feature can make these securities more attractive in an environment where interest rates are expected to rise, as they can potentially offer higher yields in the future.However, investors should also be aware of the liquidity and market demand for these types of securities. Preferred stocks often trade with less liquidity than common stocks, which can impact the price and the ease of entry or exit from positions. Additionally, the performance of financial companies like Ellington Financial can be sensitive to changes in interest rates, mortgage rates and real estate market conditions, which should be factored into an investor's analysis of the company's dividend announcements and overall investment potential. Economist Dividend announcements, such as those made by Ellington Financial, can have macroeconomic implications. They often reflect the company's sector-specific outlook and the management's expectations regarding future earnings and economic conditions. In a stable or growing economy, companies may increase dividends as earnings improve. Conversely, during economic downturns, dividends can be reduced or suspended as companies brace for lower earnings.From an economic perspective, the payment of dividends can signal to the market that the company has a steady cash flow, which may be interpreted as a positive indicator of economic stability within the sector. However, it is also critical to analyze these dividends in the context of the overall economy. For instance, if economic indicators suggest a potential downturn, the sustainability of these dividends could come into question. 03/07/2024 - 04:17 PM OLD GREENWICH, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ellington Financial Inc. (NYSE: EFC) (the ""Company"") today announced that its Board of Directors has declared the following: (i) a monthly dividend of $0.13 per share of common stock, payable on April 25, 2024 to common stockholders of record as of March 29, 2024; (ii) a quarterly dividend of $0.421875 per share on the Company's 6.750% Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, payable on April 30, 2024 to Series A preferred stockholders of record as of March 29, 2024; (iii) a quarterly dividend of $0.390625 per share on the Company's 6.250% Series B Fixed-Rate Reset Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, payable on April 30, 2024 to Series B preferred stockholders of record as of March 29, 2024; (iv) a quarterly dividend of $0.5390625 per share on the Company's 8.625% Series C Fixed-Rate Reset Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, payable on April 30, 2024 to Series C preferred stockholders of record as of March 29, 2024; (v) a quarterly dividend of $0.4375 per share on the Company's 7.00% Series D Cumulative Perpetual Redeemable Preferred Stock, payable on April 1, 2024 to Series D preferred stockholders of record as of March 20, 2024; and (vi) a quarterly dividend of $0.515625 per share on the Company's 8.250% Series E Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, payable on April 1, 2024 to Series E preferred stockholders of record as of March 20, 2024.

Negative impact of lower industry activity on gross profit and gross margin. Costs incurred in legal matters and potential ongoing litigation in Canada. Financial Analyst The reported financials indicate a challenging period for NCS Multistage Holdings, Inc., with a decline in total revenues and a net loss for the full year 2023. The 12% decrease in Q4 revenues year-over-year reflects broader industry headwinds, such as lower natural gas prices and reduced activity levels. The gross margin contraction from 39% to 35% in Q4 and the adjusted EBITDA reduction suggest operational challenges in maintaining profitability amidst these conditions.The legal settlement that resulted in a net income of $39.6 million, despite an adjusted net loss, is a one-off event that investors should consider when evaluating the company's core operational performance. The year-over-year improvement in free cash flow is a positive note, indicating better management of working capital and operational efficiency. However, the company's outlook for 2024, with expected flat to lower activity in Canada and a decline in the United States, suggests that the sector's headwinds may persist.Investors should also note the capital expenditures, which have increased year-over-year, indicating ongoing investments in the business despite the challenging environment. This could be a sign of management's confidence in the company's long-term prospects or a necessary step to maintain competitiveness. Market Research Analyst The oil and gas industry, where NCS operates, is highly cyclical and sensitive to commodity price fluctuations and geopolitical events. The reported decrease in rig counts and lower activity levels reflect a broader industry trend that may continue to impact NCS's performance. The company's focus on innovation and expansion in areas such as the North Sea and tracer diagnostics service line indicates a strategic pivot towards diversification and capturing new market segments.The anticipated modest changes in drilling and completion activity for 2024 and the company's plans to outperform these changes suggest an aggressive strategy to gain market share. However, the risks associated with the patent infringement case in Canada and the potential for prolonged legal disputes could be a concern for investors and may impact future financials.The strong balance sheet and liquidity position with $16.7 million in cash and an undrawn ABL facility provide the company with a cushion to weather industry downturns and invest in growth opportunities. The management's commentary on aligning with larger customers and international oil companies also suggests a strategic shift towards more stable revenue sources. Legal Expert The resolution of the legal matter in Texas with no cash payment required by NCS is a significant relief to the company's financial position. The reversal of the $40.8 million litigation provision has resulted in a substantial non-operational boost to the net income for Q4. However, it's important to recognize that this is a non-recurring event that does not reflect the company's underlying business performance.On the other hand, the ongoing patent infringement case in Canada presents a potential risk. The costs associated with the case and the uncertainty of its outcome can affect future financials and investor sentiment. The company's intention to appeal the decision and reduce the costs award indicates that legal expenses may continue to be a drag on earnings in the short term.Investors should be mindful of the impact that such legal matters can have on the company's reputation and financial health, as well as the potential for unforeseen liabilities that could arise from ongoing litigation. 03/07/2024 - 04:20 PM Fourth Quarter Results Total revenues of $35.2 million, compared to $40.2 million in 2022Net income of $39.6 million and earnings per diluted share of $15.80, benefited by a legal settlement, compared to $2.0 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.81 for the fourth quarter of 2022Adjusted net loss of $(0.9) million and adjusted loss per share of $(0.36), compared to adjusted net income of $1.8 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.75 in the fourth quarter of 2022Adjusted EBITDA of $2.5 million, compared to $6.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 Full Year Results Total revenues of $142.5 million, compared to $155.6 million in 2022Net loss of $(3.2) million and a loss per share of $(1.27), compared to a net loss of $(1.1) million and a loss per share of $(0.45) in 2022Adjusted net loss of $(1.3) million and adjusted loss per share of $(0.51), compared to adjusted net loss of $(0.2) million and adjusted loss per share of $(0.09) in 2022Adjusted EBITDA of $11.9 million, compared to $15.1 million in 2022Free cash flow after distributions to non-controlling interest of $2.6 million, an increase of $4.7 million compared to 2022 HOUSTON, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NCS Multistage Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: NCSM) (the “Company,” “NCS,” “we” or “us”), a leading provider of highly engineered products and support services that facilitate the optimization of oil and natural gas well construction, well completions and field development strategies, today announced its results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. Financial Review Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Total revenues were $35.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. This decrease reflects lower U.S. and international product sales and services revenues and lower Canadian services revenues, partially offset by an increase in Canadian product sales. These results were impacted by lower activity levels in 2023 compared to the prior year. The average rig counts in Canada and the United States decreased in the fourth quarter of 2023 by 4% and 21%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2022. Sales of our products in the United States continue to be affected by lower natural gas prices, which had a negative impact on customer activity levels, and sales in Canada were primarily impacted by the commodity price volatility and continuing effect of the Canadian wildfires in 2023. Compared to the third quarter of 2023, total revenues decreased by 8%, with a decrease in revenue in Canada of 11%, reflecting the expected decline in the fourth quarter as customers reduced activity for the winter holidays, as well as a decrease of 45% in international markets for which individual orders can be larger and less frequent, partially offset by an increase of 14% in the United States, supported by increased sales of sliding sleeves and composite plugs. Gross profit was $12.3 million, or a gross margin of 35%, for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $15.6 million, or 39%, for the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross margin was lower primarily due to lower product sales volumes and lower services activity impacted by a general decrease in industry activity. Adjusted gross profit, which we define as total revenues less total cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization (DD&A), was $12.9 million, or an Adjusted gross margin of 37%, for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $16.1 million, or 40%, for the fourth quarter of 2022. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses totaled $13.2 million, remaining flat to one year ago. Other income was $0.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to $1.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. This decrease was largely due to a $0.7 million write-off of an internally developed asset in December 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2023 we reversed our previously recorded $40.8 million provision for litigation, net of recoveries, as our legal matter in Texas was settled by us, our insurance company and the plaintiff, with no cash payment to be made by the Company. Net income was $39.6 million, or $15.80 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, benefitted by such settlement, compared to net income of $2.0 million, or $0.81 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Our adjusted net loss for the quarter was $(0.9) million, or $(0.36) per share, which adjusts primarily for the litigation provision, net of recoveries, as noted above, compared to adjusted net income of $1.8 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, for the same quarter in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $3.9 million compared to the same period a year ago. This decrease is primarily the result of lower revenues compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Full Year 2023 Financial Results For the year ended December 31, 2023, total revenues were $142.5 million, a decrease of $13.2 million, or 8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease reflected lower U.S. product sales as well as a decrease in U.S., Canadian and international services activity, partially offset by increases in Canadian and international product sales. Gross profit was $53.4 million, or a gross margin of 37%, for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $58.4 million, or 38%, in 2022. Adjusted gross profit was $55.6 million, or an Adjusted gross margin of 39%, for the full year 2023, compared to $60.4 million, or 39%, in 2022. Net loss was $(3.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to a net loss of $(1.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted net loss was $(1.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to adjusted net loss of $(0.2) million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $3.2 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $4.8 million, a $6.2 million improvement compared to a use of cash of $(1.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Free cash flow after distributions to non-controlling interest for 2023 was $2.6 million compared to a use of cash of $(2.1) million for 2022. The overall increase in net cash flows was primarily attributed to a smaller increase in net working capital in 2023 as compared to 2022, offset by a higher net loss. Liquidity and Capital Expenditures As of December 31, 2023, NCS had $16.7 million in cash and $8.2 million in total debt, and an available borrowing base from our undrawn asset-based revolving credit facility (“ABL Facility”) of $16.4 million. Our working capital, defined as current assets minus current liabilities, was $71.2 million and $70.0 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. NCS incurred capital expenditures, net of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, of $1.7 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Legal Matters In regards to the previously disclosed legal matter in Texas, in December 2023, NCS, the plaintiff and the insurance carrier settled the matter where the insurance carrier agreed to pay the mutually-agreed settlement amounts to the plaintiff in settlement of all liabilities, resulting in no cash payments by NCS. Consequently, we reversed our previously recorded litigation provision of $40.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2023. Remaining on our balance sheet at December 31, 2023, is a receivable and corresponding accrual for legal contingency that reflects the portion of the settlement that had yet to be paid by the insurance carrier as of year-end. The insurance carrier paid the agreed amount to the plaintiff in January 2024 and, as a result, we expect to reverse both balances during the first quarter of 2024. In regards to the previously disclosed patent infringement case in Canada, the parties attended a mediation meeting in late February 2024. While no agreement has yet been reached, the parties have expressed interest in continuing with the settlement discussions. If we are unable to reach a settlement with our counterparty, the appeals process could take over a year and could result in a new trial or further appeals, which may not conclude for several years thereafter. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2023, NCS paid approximately $1.8 million in costs and disbursements granted by the judge, which we believe that applicable law supports strong grounds to appeal the decision by the court as well as to reduce the costs award significantly. For a more detailed description of these matters, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Review and Outlook NCS’s Chief Executive Officer, Ryan Hummer commented, “The fourth quarter concluded a challenging year for NCS and our industry, as customer activity levels declined throughout the year in the U.S. and with Canadian customer activity in the second half of 2023 declining as compared to the same period in 2022. Our full year 2023 revenue of $142.5 million decreased compared to 2022 by $13.2 million, or 8%, with revenue declines of 3%, 18% and 23% in Canada, the U.S. and in international markets, respectively. Despite the lower overall revenue, we made significant progress in certain areas, including growing our revenue and customer base for PurpleSeal composite frac plugs in Canada. We added a new customer for fracturing systems in the North Sea during the year and have made significant strides in qualifying our tracer diagnostics service line to enter additional markets outside of North America in 2023 and 2024. We have also focused on being better aligned with certain larger customers, including large independents, international oil companies and national oil companies. We were able to maintain our Adjusted gross margin percentage at 39% of revenue in 2023, despite the year-over-year reduction in revenue. Similarly, we reduced our SG&A expense by $1.8 million in 2023, as compared to 2022. This highlights the meaningful and proactive steps taken to streamline our operations and reduce our costs during the year, which should continue to provide benefits in the years ahead. Our resulting Adjusted EBITDA of $11.9 million for 2023 compares to Adjusted EBITDA of $15.1 million in 2022. We generated free cash flow, after distributions to non-controlling interest, of $2.6 million, a year-over-year improvement of $4.7 million, despite a further year-over-year investment in net working capital of $1.0 million. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, ending 2023 with $16.7 million in cash and an undrawn ABL facility with a borrowing base of approximately $16.4 million. As we previously announced, I am pleased we were able to settle the Texas Matter with our insurance carrier and the plaintiff during the fourth quarter. This settlement had no resulting cash impact to NCS, as we had anticipated. Looking ahead to 2024, based on current industry reports and announced capital budgets, we believe the average drilling and completion industry activity in Canada will be flat or slightly lower compared to 2023, and activity in the United States will decline on average by 5% to 10% compared to 2023, although we expect U.S. activity to increase compared to December 2023 levels as the year progresses. We currently expect international industry activity to improve on average between 5% to 10% in 2024. We believe the value that we bring to our customers across our product and service portfolio, together with continued product and service innovation, positions us to outperform these modest changes in drilling and completion activity and improve our revenue in 2024 over 2023, especially in the U.S and in international markets. The improvement we anticipate will be driven in part by our increasing customer base in the North Sea for work in 2024, a multiple-pad tracer diagnostics project with a leading regional national oil company in the Middle East, and increased sales at Repeat Precision, driven in part by an increase in activity with an operator in the Permian Basin following an extensive technical evaluation of several composite plug providers. As we look to 2024, we will be focused on capitalizing on these near-term opportunities and acting to ensure long-term success in alignment with our core strategies of: i) building upon our leading market positions; ii) capitalizing on international and offshore opportunities; and iii) commercializing innovative solutions to complex customer challenges. I am excited for 2024 and want to express my thanks to our team at NCS and at Repeat Precision. I appreciate the hard work and dedication of our outstanding people, who came together to face the unexpected challenges encountered during 2023. We have the right team, the right technology, and the right strategies in place to deliver extraordinary outcomes to our customers, drive innovation in the industry and to create value for our shareholders.” Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA Less Share-Based Compensation, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Share, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow Less Distributions to Non-Controlling Interest and net working capital are non-GAAP financial measures.

Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry and are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial performance as reported under GAAP, and they should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, gross profit, gross margin, cash provided by (used in) operating activities, working capital or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as measures of our liquidity. However, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA Less Share-Based Compensation, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Share, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow Less Distributions to Non-Controlling Interest and net working capital are key metrics that management uses to assess the period-to-period performance of our core business operations or metrics that enable investors to assess our performance from period to period to evaluate our performance relative to other companies that are not subject to such factors, or who may provide similar non-GAAP measures in their public disclosures. The tables below set forth reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable measures of financial performance calculated under GAAP: NET WORKING CAPITAL* Net working capital is defined as total current assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents, minus total current liabilities, excluding current maturities of long-term debt. Net working capital excludes cash and cash equivalents and current maturities of long-term debt in order to evaluate the investment in working capital that we believe are required to support our business. We believe that net working capital is useful in analyzing the cash flow and working capital needs of the Company, including determining the efficiencies of our operations and our ability to readily convert assets into cash.

NCS MULTISTAGE HOLDINGS, INC.RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION(In thousands) (Unaudited) ADJUSTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN, AND ADJUSTED EBITDA LESS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude certain items which we believe are not reflective of ongoing operating performance or which, in the case of share-based compensation, is non-cash in nature. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues. Adjusted EBITDA Less Share-Based Compensation is defined as Adjusted EBITDA minus share-based compensation expense. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure that excludes costs that management believes do not reflect our ongoing operating performance, legal proceedings for intellectual property as further described below, and certain costs associated with our capital structure. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA Less Share-Based Compensation presents our financial performance in a manner that is comparable to the presentation provided by many of our peers. We periodically incur legal costs associated with the assertion of, or defense of, intellectual property, which we exclude from our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Less Share-Based Compensation, unless we believe that settlement will occur prior to any material legal spend (included in the table below as “Professional Fees”). Although these costs may recur between periods, depending on legal matters then outstanding or in process, we believe the timing of when these costs are incurred does not typically match the settlement or recoveries associated with such matters, and therefore, can distort our operating results. Similarly, we exclude from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Less Share-Based Compensation the one-time settlement or recovery payment associated with these excluded legal matters when realized but would not exclude any go forward royalties or payments, if applicable. We expect to continue to incur these legal costs for current matters under appeal and for any future cases that may go to trial, provided that the amount will vary by period.

FREE CASH FLOW AND FREE CASH FLOW LESS DISTRIBUTIONS TO NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment (inclusive of the purchase and development of software and technology) plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment, as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows. We define free cash flow less distributions to non-controlling interest as free cash flow less amounts reported in the financing activities section of the statement of cash flows as distributions to non-controlling interest. We believe free cash flow is useful because it provides information to investors regarding the cash that was available in the period that was in excess of our needs to fund our capital expenditures and other investment needs. We believe that free cash flow less distributions to non-controlling interest is useful because it provides information to investors regarding the cash that was available in the period that was in excess of our needs to fund our capital expenditures, other investment needs, and cash distributions to our joint venture partner.

(EFC) reports an estimated book value per share of $13.73 as of January 31, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The estimated book value per share (BVPS) is a critical metric for investors as it represents the company's net asset value on a per-share basis. Ellington Financial Inc.'s disclosure of a BVPS of $13.73 provides an important snapshot of the company's financial health as of January 31, 2024. It allows investors to gauge the potential equity value of their investment and compare it with the current market price to determine whether the stock is undervalued or overvalued. A BVPS higher than the market price could indicate an undervalued stock, potentially leading to a market correction in the company's favor.However, investors should also consider the company's historical BVPS trends and the reasons behind any significant changes. Factors such as earnings performance, changes in asset values and dividend payouts can affect BVPS. Understanding these underlying factors is essential for a comprehensive assessment of the company's valuation and future prospects. Market Research Analyst The real estate investment sector, where Ellington Financial operates, is sensitive to interest rate changes, regulatory shifts and economic cycles. The reported BVPS must be contextualized within the broader market conditions, including real estate prices, mortgage rates and the credit environment. For instance, a rising interest rate environment might pressure the book value of a real estate investment company due to increased borrowing costs and potential depreciation in real estate asset values.Additionally, the market's reaction to the disclosed BVPS will depend on the expectations set by analysts and prior company guidance. If the reported figure deviates significantly from the consensus estimates, it could lead to increased volatility in the stock price. Investors should monitor the stock's performance and the overall market response to assess the potential impact on their investment portfolios. Economist Ellington Financial Inc.'s BVPS is also an indirect indicator of the broader economic environment's impact on financial entities. A stable or increasing BVPS over time could suggest that the company is effectively managing its portfolio in the face of economic headwinds, such as inflation or recessionary pressures. Conversely, a declining BVPS might raise concerns about asset quality and risk management practices.From an economic standpoint, analyzing the company's BVPS trends alongside macroeconomic indicators can provide insights into the resilience of the financial sector and the real estate market. It is also relevant to consider the company's performance in relation to its peers, as this could signal competitive advantages or disadvantages that could influence long-term shareholder value. 03/07/2024 - 04:16 PM OLD GREENWICH, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ellington Financial Inc.

Despite challenging macroeconomic conditions, the company aims for growth and profitability in 2024 as a pure-play outdoor business. Positive Adventure segment generates highest quarterly revenue of the year. Proceeds from Precision Sport sale utilized to repay all debt and significantly increase cash position. Company positioned for growth and profitability in 2024 and beyond as a pure-play outdoor business. Sales for Q4 2023 were $76.5 million compared to $73.8 million in the same period last year. Gross margin decreased to 28.9% from 37.2% in the same quarter last year. Loss from continuing operations in Q4 2023 was $7.2 million compared to $83.3 million in Q4 2022. Adjusted loss from continuing operations in Q4 2023 was $2.8 million compared to adjusted income of $4.4 million in Q4 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $(3.5) million with a margin of (4.5)% compared to $3.6 million with a margin of 4.9% in the same period last year. Precision Sport segment reported as discontinued operations due to sale announcement in December 2023. Sales for full-year 2023 were $286.0 million compared to $315.3 million in 2022. Gross margin for 2023 was 34.1% compared to 34.9% in 2022. Loss from continuing operations in 2023 was $15.8 million compared to $92.8 million in 2022. Adjusted loss from continuing operations in 2023 was $1.5 million compared to adjusted income of $9.4 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 was $1.2 million with a margin of 0.4% compared to $17.6 million with a margin of 5.6% in 2022. Negative None. Financial Analyst Clarus Corporation's recent financial results indicate a pivotal strategic shift with the divestiture of their Precision Sport segment. The transaction's completion has fortified the company's balance sheet, eliminating debt and boosting cash reserves significantly. This newfound financial flexibility is critical for Clarus as it can now more aggressively invest in growth and profitability initiatives within its core Outdoor and Adventure segments without the burden of interest expenses and principal repayments.The reported losses, both quarterly and annually, may raise concerns among investors about the company's current profitability. However, it is important to note that these losses include a substantial non-cash impairment charge from the previous year, which distorts the loss figures when compared to this year's performance. The adjusted EBITDA figures, although still in the negative territory for the fourth quarter, provide a more normalized view of the company's operating performance.Looking forward, the company's focus on ESG principles may appeal to socially conscious investors and could potentially open up new avenues for growth, given the increasing consumer preference for sustainable products. However, the reduced gross margins year-over-year suggest that there may be cost pressures that need to be managed to improve profitability. Market Research Analyst The outdoor enthusiast market has been witnessing a surge in demand, particularly as consumers seek leisure and adventure activities post-pandemic. Clarus Corporation's strategic decision to become a pure-play outdoor business could capitalize on this trend. The Adventure segment's robust sales growth in the last quarter is indicative of this positive market trajectory. However, the broader macroeconomic headwinds and consumer demand fluctuations mentioned by the Executive Chairman suggest that the company and the industry at large, are not immune to economic cycles.Investors should monitor how Clarus leverages its streamlined operations to capture market share and whether its leadership can effectively execute on new opportunities. A key factor will be the company's ability to innovate and differentiate its product offerings to maintain a competitive edge in a market that is becoming increasingly saturated with both established players and new entrants. Economist The outdoor sector is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, as discretionary spending on leisure activities is often one of the first areas consumers cut back on during economic downturns. Despite this, Clarus Corporation's focus on long-term profitability and growth, as highlighted by their Executive Chairman, signals confidence in the resilience of their market segment. The elimination of debt is a strategic move that reduces financial risk and may provide a buffer against future economic shocks.However, investors should remain cautious as the company's current performance shows a contraction in sales year-over-year and a decline in gross margin. These factors could be reflective of broader economic challenges or specific operational inefficiencies. The company's ability to navigate these challenges while executing on growth initiatives will be crucial for its success in the coming years. 03/07/2024 - 04:15 PM Adventure Segment Generates Highest Quarterly Revenue of the Year Proceeds from Precision Sport Sale Used to Repay All Debt and Significantly Increased Cash Position Positioning Company for Growth and Profitability in 2024 and Beyond as a Pure-Play Outdoor Business SALT LAKE CITY, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clarus Corporation (NASDAQ: CLAR) (“Clarus” and/or the “Company”), a global company focused on the outdoor enthusiast markets, reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.

Management Commentary “Despite very challenging macroeconomic headwinds throughout 2023 that adversely impacted consumer demand, we have taken important steps to realign our brands and inventory levels to position Clarus for long-term profitable growth as a pure-play, ESG-friendly outdoor business,” said Warren Kanders, Clarus’ Executive Chairman. “After completing the sale of our Precision Sport segment, we are debt-free with over $40 million of cash on the balance sheet. We have a streamlined company focused on two operating segments poised for growth, each with strong leaders with highly capable teams focused on increasing profitability and unlocking new opportunities.” Mr. Kanders added, “The monetization of our Precision Sport segment for $175 million was a highly successful outcome for Clarus. Clarus invested approximately $132 million in the Precision Sports segment since 2017. During our ownership period, the segment returned over $94 million of cash to Clarus and with the recently completed sale, it has generated nearly $270 million of returns. The operating income from Precision Sport also helped use a substantial portion of our net operating losses. With the proceeds from this sale, we retired in full all of Clarus’ outstanding debt and emerged with a debt-free balance sheet and flexibility to pursue our long-term growth initiatives at the Outdoor and Adventure segments.” Mr. Kanders concluded, “We are pleased with the progress we have made at our Adventure segment, which had its best quarter of the year with 43% sales growth. With respect to Outdoor, I am excited about our potential to build long-term value. We are still in the early innings of our business turnaround. We are actively simplifying the organizational structure, our product categories and channel strategy. We have taken a careful view of inventory levels to better align with expected market demand. In 2024 we expect total company net sales in the range of $270 million to $280 million and adjusted EBITDA of $16 million to $18 million.” Sale of Precision Sport / Discontinued Operations On December 29, 2023, the Company announced the sale of its Precision Sport segment for $175 million. As the disposition was completed on February 29, 2024, we expect to recognize a gain on the disposition during the three months ending March 31, 2024. The activities of the Precision Sport segment have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Sales in the fourth quarter were $76.5 million compared to $73.8 million in the same year‐ago quarter. This was driven by strength at the Adventure segment due to success with OEM customers. This was partly offset by softness in the European region at Outdoor. Sales in the Adventure segment increased 43% to $26.4 million, or $26.6 million on a constant currency basis, compared to $18.5 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting increasing sales in the Australian market and the benefit of the TRED Outdoors acquisition announced during the fourth quarter of 2023. Sales in the Outdoor segment were $50.1 million, or $50.0 million on a constant currency basis, compared to $55.3 million in the year ago quarter. The decline primarily reflects continuing challenging market conditions, particularly in Europe. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 28.9% compared to 37.2% in the year‐ago quarter. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to $4.2 million of inventory reserve increases at the Outdoor segment. Adjusted gross margin in the fourth quarter was 29.0% compared to 37.2% in the year-ago quarter related to the inventory step-up as a result of the TRED Outdoors acquisition. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were $30.7 million compared to $29.9 million in the same year‐ago quarter. The increase was attributable to the Outdoor segment with higher legal and marketing expenses compared to the prior year. The loss from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $7.2 million, or $(0.19) per diluted share, compared to loss from continuing operations of $83.3 million, or $(2.25) per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Loss from continuing operations in the fourth quarter included $1.5 million of one-off charges relating to restructuring and transaction costs. The loss from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2022 included a non-cash impairment charge of $92.3 million at the Adventure segment. Adjusted loss from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $2.8 million, or $(0.07) per diluted share, compared to adjusted income from continuing operations of $4.3 million, or $0.11 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted (loss) income from continuing operations excludes restructuring charges and transaction costs, as well as non-cash items such as amortization, stock-based compensation, inventory fair value of purchase accounting and impairment charges. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $(3.5) million, or an adjusted EBITDA margin of (4.5)%, compared to $3.6 million, or an adjusted EBITDA margin of 4.9%, in the same year‐ ago quarter. The decline in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by continuing challenging market conditions at Outdoor, an increase in inventory reserves at Outdoor and higher legal and marketing expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2023, was $14.5 million compared to $32.4 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $1.2 million compared to $2.0 million in the prior year quarter. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $13.3 million compared to $30.3 million in the prior year quarter. Liquidity at December 31, 2023 vs. December 31, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents totaled $11.3 million compared to $12.0 million.Total debt of $119.8 million compared to $139.0 million.On February 29, 2024, approximately $135.0 million of long-term debt, interest and fees were repaid and the credit agreement was subsequently terminated. Full Year 2023 Financial Results Sales in 2023 decreased 9.3% to $286.0 million compared to $315.3 million in 2022. The decrease in sales was primarily driven by continued softness in Outdoor wholesale markets in both North America and Europe as well as lower demand at Rhino-Rack USA compared to the prior year. From a segment perspective, Outdoor sales were down 8% to $204.1 million and Adventure sales were down 12% to $82.0 million, compared to 2022. Gross margin in 2023 was 34.1% compared to 34.9% in 2022 primarily due to promotional pricing and increased inventory reserves at the Outdoor segment, as well as unfavorable foreign currency exchange movement. These decreases were partially offset by favorable variances, primarily related to easing freight costs, at both the Outdoor and Adventure segments. Adjusted gross margin in 2023 was 34.1% compared to 35.0% in 2022 due to the impact of the TRED Outdoors acquisition in 2023 and Maxtrax in 2022. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2023 were $116.4 million compared to $120.8 million in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to reduced stock compensation, as well as expense reduction initiatives to offset challenging market conditions, lower intangible amortization expense, and lower sales commissions due to decreased revenue. Loss from continuing operations in 2023 was $15.8 million, or $(0.42) per diluted share, compared to net loss of $92.8 million, or $(2.49) per diluted share, in the prior year. Loss from continuing operations in 2022 included a $92.3 million non-cash impairment charge in the Adventure segment. Adjusted loss from continuing operations in 2023 was $1.5 million, or $(0.04) per diluted share, compared to adjusted income from continuing operations of $9.4 million, or $0.24 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted (loss) income from continuing operations excludes restructuring charges and transaction costs, as well as non-cash items such as amortization, stock-based compensation, inventory fair value of purchase accounting, contingent consideration and impairment charges. Adjusted EBITDA in 2023 was $1.2 million, or an adjusted EBITDA margin of 0.4%, compared to $17.6 million, or an adjusted EBITDA margin of 5.6%, in 2022. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $31.9 million compared to $14.6 million in 2022. Capital expenditures in 2023 were $5.7 million compared to $8.2 million in the prior year. Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $26.2 million compared to $6.4 million in the same year‐ago period. This increase is primarily due to lower inventory. 2024 Outlook The Company expects fiscal year 2024 sales to range between $270 million to $280 million and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $16 million to $18 million, or an adjusted EBITDA margin of 6.2% at the mid-point of revenue and adjusted EBITDA. In addition, capital expenditures are expected to range between $4 million to $5 million and free cash flow is expected to range between $18 million to $20 million for the full year 2024. Clarus has not provided net income guidance due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting certain types of expenses and gains, which affect net income but not Adjusted EBITDA and/or Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Therefore, we do not provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and/or Adjusted EBITDA Margin guidance to net income guidance. Net Operating Loss (NOL) The Company has net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes of $7.7 million. The Company believes its U.S. Federal NOLs will substantially offset its future U.S. Federal income taxes until expiration. None of NOLs expire until December 31, 2027, which the Company expects to realize in their entirety in 2024.

Use of Non‐GAAP Measures The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). This press release contains the non-GAAP measures: (i) adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross profit, (ii) adjusted (loss) income from continuing operations and related earnings (loss) per diluted share, (iii) earnings before interest, taxes, other income or expense, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin, and (iv) free cash flow (defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures). The Company believes that the presentation of certain non-GAAP measures, i.e.: (i) adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross profit, (ii) adjusted (loss) income from continuing operations and related earnings (loss) per diluted share , (iii) EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, and (iv) free cash flow, provide useful information for the understanding of its ongoing operations and enables investors to focus on period-over-period operating performance, and thereby enhances the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance relative to past performance and provides, along with the nearest GAAP measures, a baseline for modeling future earnings expectations. Non-GAAP measures are reconciled to comparable GAAP financial measures within this press release. The Company cautions that non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the Company's reported GAAP results. Additionally, the Company notes that there can be no assurance that the above referenced non-GAAP financial measures are comparable to similarly titled financial measures used by other publicly traded companies.

(SWBI) reported Q3 net sales of $137.5 million, with a gross margin of 28.7% and EPS of $0.17/share. Non-GAAP gross margin was 29.1% and adjusted EPS was $0.19/share. Adjusted EBITDAS margin was 15.6%. The company's GAAP net income was $7.9 million, a decrease from the previous year. Despite this, Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc. remains optimistic about market share gains and sustained demand for their products. Positive Net sales for Q3 were $137.5 million, a 6.5% increase from the previous year. Gross margin was 28.7%, with non-GAAP gross margin at 29.1%. GAAP net income was $7.9 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared to $11.1 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, in the previous year. Non-GAAP net income was $8.7 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to $11.6 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the previous year. Adjusted EBITDAS margin was 15.6% of net sales. Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc. believes it gained market share with strong shipments and robust demand for new products. The company expects healthy demand in the firearm market through the 2024 election cycle. Cash generated by operations was $25.4 million, with inventory in the distribution channel declining. The company repurchased shares and paid dividends in the third quarter. A $0.12 per share quarterly dividend was authorized for stockholders. The company will host a conference call and webcast to discuss Q3 financial results. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in net sales by 6.5% is a positive indicator of Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc.'s market performance, particularly given the broader economic context. However, the decline in gross margin from 32.4% to 28.7% year-over-year suggests increasing costs or pricing pressures that could affect profitability. The discrepancy between GAAP and non-GAAP net income, with adjustments for significant costs such as the relocation of headquarters, highlights the importance of understanding one-time expenses and their impact on the company's financial health.From a cash flow perspective, the increase in cash generated by operations is commendable and suggests efficient management of working capital, particularly in maintaining receivables and reducing inventory. The share repurchase activity, although modest relative to the authorization, signals confidence by management in the intrinsic value of the company's stock. The dividend payment consistency aligns with a shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy, which is often appreciated by income-focused investors. Market Research Analyst The assertion of market share gains by Smith & Wesson, as indicated by shipments outpacing the overall firearm market, requires further analysis against industry reports and competitors' performance. The company's anticipation of healthy demand through the 2024 election cycle could be predicated on historical trends where firearm sales often increase during election years due to potential policy changes. However, this should be weighed against any potential regulatory risks that could emerge from the political environment.The decline in inventory levels in the distribution channel is an indicator of strong retail demand, which is a positive sign for the company's sell-through rates. This could also imply better inventory management and a leaner supply chain, which can be a competitive advantage. The focus on new product development and innovation is crucial in the firearms industry, where product differentiation can drive consumer preference and loyalty. Economist The Adjusted EBITDAS margin reduction from 19.5% to 15.6% reveals a contraction in operational efficiency or profitability that warrants attention. This metric is significant as it provides insight into the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, which is a proxy for the company's ability to generate cash from operations. The contraction may be due to a variety of factors, including increased operational costs, changes in product mix, or market dynamics.It's also important to consider the broader economic factors at play. The company's performance must be contextualized within the current macroeconomic environment, which includes factors such as consumer spending power, inflation rates and supply chain issues. Any shifts in these areas can have a material impact on Smith & Wesson's business operations and future financial results. 03/07/2024 - 04:15 PM Q3 Net Sales of $137.5 MillionQ3 Gross Margin of 28.7%; Non-GAAP Gross Margin of 29.1% Q3 EPS of $0.17/Share; Q3 Adjusted EPS of $0.19/ShareQ3 Adjusted EBITDAS Margin of 15.6%Maryville, Tennessee--(Newsfile Corp. - March 7, 2024) - Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc.

During the quarter, inventory in the distribution channel declined from October levels, in terms of actual units and weeks of inventory, indicating strong sell through of our products at retail.

From time-to-time, we consider and use these supplemental measures of operating performance in order to provide the reader with an improved understanding of underlying performance trends. We believe it is useful for us and the reader to review, as applicable, both (1) GAAP measures that include (i) interest expense, (ii) income tax expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) stock-based compensation expense, (v) spin related stock-based compensation, (vi) an accrued legal settlement, (vii) Relocation expense, and (viii) the tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments; and (2) the non-GAAP measures that exclude such information. We present these non-GAAP measures because we consider them an important supplemental measure of our performance. Our definition of these adjusted financial measures may differ from similarly named measures used by others. We believe these measures facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating potential differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our GAAP measures. The principal limitations of these measures are that they do not reflect our actual expenses and may thus have the effect of inflating its financial measures on a GAAP basis.About Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc.Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc.

Negative None. Financial Analyst An examination of Quanex Building Products Corporation's financial results reveals several key takeaways that are significant from a financial perspective. Firstly, the gross margin expansion from 19.8% to 21.5% despite a decrease in net sales indicates a strong focus on cost control and operational efficiency. This is particularly notable in an environment of softer market demand and pricing pressures. The ability of the company to repay $5 million in bank debt and maintain a strong balance sheet with a leverage ratio of Net Debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA at 0.1x is a testament to their cash management and financial prudence. However, the decline in net sales across its segments, with a notable 21.1% drop in the North American Cabinet Components segment, could be a cause for concern if the trend continues. Despite this, the company's guidance for fiscal 2024 indicates an expected net sales of approximately $1.1 billion and an Adjusted EBITDA of $145 million to $150 million, suggesting confidence in a recovery in the latter half of the year. This guidance, however, should be viewed with caution as it is based on current market conditions and the assumption of improving consumer confidence. Market Research Analyst From a market research standpoint, Quanex's performance needs to be contextualized within the broader residential housing market. The company's positive long-term view is supported by the resilience of the housing market and demographic trends that drive demand for housing and related products. Nevertheless, the short-term cautious outlook reflects the current macroeconomic challenges that could affect consumer spending and housing investments. The strategic focus on both organic and inorganic growth opportunities suggests that Quanex is seeking to diversify and strengthen its market position in anticipation of future demand. The company's ability to navigate pricing pressures and raw material cost fluctuations will be critical in maintaining margins. As a supplier of building products, Quanex's performance is closely tied to construction cycles and consumer confidence, both of which are currently facing headwinds from economic uncertainty. Investors should monitor housing starts, building permits and macroeconomic indicators that could signal shifts in the market that would directly affect Quanex's business. Economist Analyzing Quanex's financial results from an economic perspective, the impact of macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, inflation and overall economic growth cannot be overstated. The company's cautious stance for the first half of 2024 aligns with broader economic uncertainties that may dampen consumer spending and investment in housing. However, the unchanged leverage ratio and strong liquidity position indicate that the company is well-equipped to weather potential economic downturns. The seasonality of the business is also an important factor, as evidenced by the historical trend of being a net borrower in the first fiscal quarter. The repayment of bank debt in this typically challenging period suggests that Quanex has a solid seasonal strategy and cash flow management. Looking forward, the company's performance will be influenced by economic policies and the overall health of the economy, which in turn affects the residential housing market and demand for Quanex's products. 03/07/2024 - 04:15 PM Margin Expansion on a Consolidated Basis Repaid $5 Million in Bank Debt Balance Sheet and Liquidity Remain Strong Cautiously Optimistic on Second Half of 2024 Positive Long-Term View on Residential Housing Market Remains Intact HOUSTON, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Quanex Building Products Corporation (NYSE:NX) (“Quanex” or the “Company”) today announced its results for the three months ended January 31, 2024. The Company reported the following selected financial results: Three Months Ended January 31,($ in millions, except per share data) 2024 2023Net Sales $239.2 $261.9Gross Margin $51.4 $51.8Gross Margin % 21.5% 19.8%Net Income $6.2 $1.9Diluted EPS $0.19 $0.06 Adjusted Net Income $5.8 $6.1Adjusted Diluted EPS $0.18 $0.18Adjusted EBITDA $19.3 $20.5Adjusted EBITDA Margin % 8.1% 7.8% Cash Provided by Operating Activities $3.9 $3.1Free Cash Flow ($5.7) ($4.4) (See Non-GAAP Terminology Definitions and Disclaimers section, Non-GAAP Financial Measure Disclosure table, Selected Segment Data table and reconciliation tables for additional information) George Wilson, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We were able to realize margin expansion on a consolidated basis for the first quarter of 2024 despite market volume softness related to normal seasonality combined with ongoing macroeconomic challenges, and some pricing pressure. Our focus on generating cash and managing working capital enabled us to pay down our bank debt by $5 million during the quarter, which is encouraging considering we have historically been a net borrower during the first quarter of our fiscal year due to the seasonality of our business. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to be positioned well to explore and evaluate both organic and inorganic growth opportunities.” First Quarter 2024 Results Summary Quanex reported net sales of $239.2 million during the three months ended January 31, 2024, which represents a decrease of 8.7% compared to $261.9 million for the same period of 2023. The decrease was largely attributable to softer market demand and lower pricing in North America. Quanex reported a 3.3% decline in net sales for the first quarter of 2024 in its North American Fenestration segment. In its North American Cabinet Components segment, Quanex reported a decline of 21.1% in net sales for the first quarter. Excluding foreign exchange impact, the Company realized a decrease in net sales of 8.4% for the first quarter in its European Fenestration segment. (See Sales Analysis table for additional information) The increase in earnings for the three months ended January 31, 2024 was mostly attributable to a decline in raw material costs, a decrease in stock-based compensation expense and lower interest expense. Balance Sheet Update As of January 31, 2024, Quanex had total debt of $65.2 million ($13.5 million excluding real-estate leases that are considered “finance” leases under U.S. GAAP) and the Company’s leverage ratio of Net Debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA was unchanged at 0.1x (Net Debt free excluding these real-estate leases). As of January 31, 2024, Quanex’s LTM Adjusted EBITDA was $158.4 million and LTM Net Income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, was $86.8 million. (See Non-GAAP Terminology Definitions and Disclaimers section, Net Debt Reconciliation table and Last Twelve Months Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation table for additional information) Outlook Mr. Wilson commented, “As mentioned on our December call, we entered this year with a somewhat cautious outlook for the first half due to the ongoing macroeconomic challenges, but we remain optimistic that demand for our products will improve in the second half as consumer confidence is restored over time. Based on conversations with our customers, recent demand trends, and the latest macro data, we are now comfortable providing guidance for fiscal 2024. Overall, on a consolidated basis, we estimate we will generate net sales of approximately $1.1 billion, which we expect will yield approximately $145 million to $150 million in Adjusted EBITDA* in fiscal 2024. While the near-term outlook for our business remains somewhat cautious, our long-term view has not changed, and we believe the underlying fundamentals for the residential housing market remain positive.” *When Quanex provides expectations for Adjusted EBITDA on a forward-looking basis, a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectations and corresponding GAAP measures is generally not available without unreasonable effort. Certain items required for such a reconciliation are outside of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted or estimated, such as the provision for income taxes.

Non-GAAP Terminology Definitions and Disclaimers Adjusted Net Income (defined as net income further adjusted to exclude purchase price accounting inventory step-ups, transaction costs, certain severance charges, gain/loss on the sale of certain fixed assets, restructuring charges, asset impairment charges, other net adjustments related to foreign currency transaction gain/loss and effective tax rates reflecting impacts of adjustments on a with and without basis) and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that Quanex believes provide a consistent basis for comparison between periods and more accurately reflects operational performance, as they are not influenced by certain income or expense items not affecting ongoing operations. EBITDA (defined as net income or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and other, net) and Adjusted EBITDA (defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude purchase price accounting inventory step-ups, transaction costs, certain severance charges, gain/loss on the sale of certain fixed assets, restructuring charges and asset impairment charges) are non-GAAP financial measures that the Company uses to measure operational performance and assist with financial decision-making. Net Debt is defined as total debt (outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility plus financial lease obligations) less cash and cash equivalents. The leverage ratio of Net Debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that the Company believes is useful to investors and financial analysts in evaluating Quanex’s leverage. In addition, with certain limited adjustments, this leverage ratio is the basis for a key covenant in the Company’s credit agreement. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure calculated using cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Quanex uses the Free Cash Flow metric to measure operational and cash management performance and assist with financial decision-making. Free Cash Flow is measured before application of certain contractual commitments (including capital lease obligations), and accordingly is not a true measure of the Company’s residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Quanex believes Free Cash Flow is useful to investors in understanding and evaluating the Company’s financial and cash management performance. Quanex believes that the presented non-GAAP measures provide a consistent basis for comparison between periods and will assist investors in understanding the Company’s financial performance when comparing results to other investment opportunities. The presented non-GAAP measures may not be the same as those used by other companies. Quanex does not intend for this information to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

(RCL) completes a private offering of $1.25 billion Senior Notes due 2032, intending to redeem outstanding Senior Notes due 2027. The Notes were offered to qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. investors. The Company plans to use the proceeds to repay existing debt. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.'s private offering of $1.25 billion in Senior Notes at a 6.250% interest rate, maturing in 2032, signifies a strategic refinancing move. This action aims to manage the company's debt profile by redeeming higher-interest debt due in 2027, which stands at 11.625%. From a financial perspective, this maneuver could lead to significant interest expense savings. The immediate effect on the company's cash flow will be positive, as lower interest payments will reduce cash outflows. However, investors should consider the long-term implications of extending the debt maturity, potentially affecting the company's leverage and interest coverage ratios.Considering the interest rate environment and comparing the new rate with the industry average for cruise operators, this issuance appears to be a prudent decision, especially if it aligns with a period of rising interest rates. The use of cash on hand and revolving credit facilities indicates a balanced approach to capital management, which is essential for maintaining liquidity without over-leveraging. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the offering's reliance on Rule 144A and Regulation S is noteworthy. Rule 144A allows for the resale of securities to qualified institutional buyers, which can expedite the process and provide access to a broad base of sophisticated investors. Regulation S permits sales to non-U.S. investors, expanding the potential market for these securities. The absence of registration under the Securities Act implies that the notes will not be subject to the same disclosure requirements as publicly traded securities, which could affect transparency for investors. However, this is a common practice for private placements and does not inherently signal any red flags.It is also important to note that these notes cannot be sold in the U.S. without registration or an exemption, limiting their liquidity for U.S. investors. The legal framework and restrictions surrounding this offering should be well-understood by potential investors, as they can influence the risk profile of the investment. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the broader market implications, Royal Caribbean's issuance of Senior Notes could reflect a broader trend in the travel and leisure industry towards restructuring debt amid fluctuating economic conditions. The cruise industry, in particular, has been sensitive to global events such as economic downturns and health crises. The ability of Royal Caribbean to secure financing at a lower interest rate than its existing debt could signal investor confidence in the company's recovery and growth prospects post-pandemic.Furthermore, the timing of this refinancing could be indicative of market expectations for interest rates and the cost of borrowing. If the company has locked in a lower rate before a potential rise in interest rates, it would be strategically beneficial. This refinancing could also be seen as a benchmark for the industry, potentially influencing the financing strategies of other players in the market. 03/07/2024 - 04:30 PM MIAMI, March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE: RCL) (the ""Company"") today announced that it has completed its private offering of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.250% Senior Notes due 2032 (the ""Notes"").

Positive DBV Technologies made significant progress in its Viaskin Peanut clinical development programs for toddlers and children with peanut allergies.

Financially, DBV saw a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents, used $79.6 million in operations primarily in R&D, and recorded a net loss of $72.7 million. The company plans to seek additional capital as it continues R&D efforts and prepares for the launch of Viaskin Peanut. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financials of DBV Technologies, including a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $67.8 million, indicate a significant burn rate that investors should monitor closely. The cash usage primarily in R&D reflects the company's investment in advancing its clinical programs, particularly the Viaskin Peanut patch. However, the sharp decrease in cash provided by financing activities, down by $187.4 million from the previous year, suggests a potential need for future capital raising to sustain operations beyond the projected timeline.The increase in operating income, primarily from the Nestlé Collaboration Agreement, may seem positive at first glance, but the termination of this agreement signals the loss of a significant revenue source. Operating expenses have decreased, which may be indicative of cost-saving measures and operational efficiency improvements. However, the stated substantial doubt regarding the company's ability to continue as a going concern raises concerns about its financial viability and the need for strategic funding solutions. Medical Research Analyst The advancement of the Viaskin Peanut clinical development programs is a critical milestone for DBV Technologies. The focus on distinct age groups could potentially address a gap in treatment options for peanut allergies, which is a market with significant unmet medical need. The initiation of supplemental safety trials, COMFORT Toddlers and COMFORT Children, is a strategic move towards strengthening the Biologics License Applications (BLA) submissions.Moreover, the successful publication of EPITOPE results in a prestigious journal and the presentation of interim data at a major conference enhance the credibility of the research. However, the delays due to the European Commission directive and the projected last subject screening by Q3 2024 may affect the time to market and should be factored into the company's strategic planning and stakeholder expectations. Market Research Analyst The food allergy treatment market is growing and DBV Technologies' focus on pediatric peanut allergy with its Viaskin Peanut patch positions it within a niche yet expanding segment. The company's progress in clinical trials and preparation for BLA submission could, if successful, capture a significant market share. However, the competitive landscape includes both established pharmaceutical companies and emerging biotech firms, which could impact DBV's market positioning and pricing strategy.Investors should consider the potential market size for Viaskin Peanut, the company's commercialization strategy and the regulatory hurdles that may influence the stock's performance. The anticipated events for 2024, including the initiation of the COMFORT trials and the publication of further efficacy and safety data, will be crucial in shaping investor sentiment and the company's market valuation. 03/07/2024 - 04:30 PM Montrouge, France, March 7, 2024 DBV Technologies Reports Full Year 2023 Financial Results and Business Update Advanced Viaskin™ Peanut clinical development programs in peanut-allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years old) and children (4 through 7 years old)Strengthened executive leadership team in preparation for BLA submissionReported cash and cash equivalents of $141 million DBV Technologies (Euronext: DBV – ISIN: FR0010417345 – Nasdaq Stock Market: DBVT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on treatment options for food allergies and other immunologic conditions with significant unmet medical need, today reported financial results for the full year 2023.

Despite the delays experienced as a result of the new European Commission directive on Clinical Trials Regulation, all countries are open and actively recruiting. We expect good momentum regarding Vitesse recruitment in the next several months and last subject screened by Q3 2024. In addition, we are initiating two supplemental six-month safety trials, COMFORT Toddlers and COMFORT Children, as the final clinical pieces to support two separate and robust packages for our Biologics License Applications to the FDA.” Mr. Tassé continued, “We are committed to working as swiftly and diligently as possible to bring this novel treatment option to market for toddlers and children and their families who are living with the daily and significant burden of a peanut allergy.” 2023 Operational Highlights Confirmed EPITOPE, DBV’s Phase 3 efficacy and safety study of Viaskin Peanut in peanut-allergic toddlers aged 1 through 3 years, is sufficient for the clinical portion of a BLA, and no additional efficacy studies were requested by the FDA.Prepared for initiation of COMFORT Toddlers and COMFORT Children, including protocol development for both supplemental six-month safety studies. Number of participants on active treatment will total approximately 600 children in each of the two BLAs, 1 to 3-year-olds and 4 to 7-year-olds.

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary technology platform, Viaskin™, to address food allergies, which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis.

It is also indicative of a broader industry trend where larger corporations invest in smaller, specialized brands to tap into specific consumer segments. Financial Analyst The transaction involving a cash outlay of $0.2 million and approximately 145,000 shares of Aterian common stock is a strategic move that could have implications for Aterian's financials.

The facility replaces existing secured credit lines and matures in 2029, providing ample room for strategic maneuvers. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The establishment of a new $900 million revolving credit facility is a significant financial maneuver that enhances Progress's capital structure. This increased liquidity can be a catalyst for strategic initiatives such as acquisitions, R&D investments, or debt refinancing. The lack of outstanding loans under the new facility indicates a conservative approach to leverage, which could be viewed favorably by investors concerned about overextension. Long-term maturity of the credit line until 2029 provides a stable financing option, potentially reducing the risk of refinancing in the near term, which can be particularly advantageous in a volatile interest rate environment. Market Research Analyst Progress's strategic positioning through the new credit facility aligns with its Total Growth Strategy, signaling to the market a readiness for accretive acquisitions. This move can be interpreted as a proactive approach to capitalizing on market opportunities, potentially driving up the company's valuation. The involvement of prominent financial institutions as agents and arrangers underscores the credibility of the deal. However, the impact on the stock price will depend on how effectively the company deploys the capital. Investors should monitor the company's acquisition targets and the integration outcomes to assess the potential for enhanced market share and revenue growth. Legal Expert The transition to an Amended Credit Agreement from the existing secured credit facilities may involve complex contractual negotiations and compliance considerations. It is essential to scrutinize the covenants and terms of the agreement, as they can significantly affect the company's operational flexibility. For instance, restrictive covenants could limit Progress's ability to engage in certain transactions or distribute dividends. Legal due diligence is crucial to ensure that the terms of the credit facility align with the company's strategic objectives while maintaining regulatory compliance and protecting shareholders' interests. 03/07/2024 - 04:21 PM New $900M facility provides liquidity and flexibility at greater scale BURLINGTON, Mass., March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Progress (NASDAQ: PRGS), the trusted provider of infrastructure software, today announced that it has entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”), which provides a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $900 million, and replaces the Company’s existing secured credit facilities.

Golden Star Filed Supplement to Proxy Statement,2024-03-07T21:30:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Golden Star Acquisition Corporation (NASDAQ: GODN) filed a supplement to the definitive proxy statement with the SEC to amend the monthly fee payable by the sponsor, extending the date for the initial business combination. The company proposed to increase the fee from $50,000 to $75,000 or $0.033 per outstanding public share. Shareholders are urged to resubmit their votes on the revised proposals.","Golden Star Filed Supplement to Proxy Statement Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Golden Star Acquisition Corporation (NASDAQ: GODN) filed a supplement to the definitive proxy statement with the SEC to amend the monthly fee payable by the sponsor, extending the date for the initial business combination. The company proposed to increase the fee from $50,000 to $75,000 or $0.033 per outstanding public share. Shareholders are urged to resubmit their votes on the revised proposals. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The amendment of the monthly fee payable by Golden Star Acquisition Corporation's sponsor into the trust account is a strategic financial decision that may affect the company's cash flow and its ability to secure additional time to complete its initial business combination. The increase from $50,000 to $75,000 represents a 50% hike in the fee, which could potentially impact the company's financial reserves. This move suggests that the company is actively seeking to prolong the period for its business combination, which may indicate challenges in finding a suitable target or finalizing a deal.Moreover, the termination of the Sponsor Undertaking Letter following the proposed fee amendment may reflect negotiations between the sponsor and the company to reach a more sustainable financial arrangement. This could have implications for investor confidence, as it reflects on the company's negotiation capabilities and the sponsor's willingness to support the company's endeavors. Shareholders should closely monitor the outcome of the upcoming meeting and the approval of the Amended Monthly Extension Fee, as it will determine the immediate financial commitments of the sponsor and the strategic direction of the company in the near term. Corporate Governance Expert The repeated postponements of the extraordinary general meeting and the subsequent amendments to the proxy statement suggest complexities in the company's governance processes. Such changes in meeting schedules and proposal terms can lead to shareholder confusion and may affect shareholder engagement and voting outcomes. It is imperative for a company in the process of an initial business combination to maintain clear and consistent communication with its shareholders, as their support is crucial for the approval of strategic decisions.The invalidation of previously submitted proxy cards and the requirement for shareholders to resubmit their votes reflect the dynamic nature of corporate governance but also impose an additional burden on shareholders. This could potentially lead to a lower turnout or misaligned voting if shareholders are not adequately informed about the changes. Companies in a similar position must ensure that their communication strategies are effective in reaching all shareholders and that the rationale behind such significant changes is transparently conveyed to mitigate any potential governance-related concerns. Securities Regulation Expert The filing of a supplement to the definitive proxy statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicates Golden Star's compliance with regulatory requirements for disclosure. The SEC mandates that material changes to proposals be communicated to shareholders, which Golden Star has done by amending Proposal No. 1 and issuing a new proxy card. This adherence to regulatory standards is critical for maintaining market integrity and protecting shareholder interests.Moreover, the emphasis on shareholders reading the 'Risk Factors' section is a reminder of the importance of due diligence. The SEC requires detailed risk disclosures for investors to make informed decisions. These disclosures are especially pertinent for a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) like Golden Star, which may face unique risks related to its initial business combination and subsequent performance. Investors should carefully consider these risks in light of the amended proposals and the company's current situation. 03/07/2024 - 04:30 PM NEW YORK, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Golden Star Acquisition Corporation (NASDAQ: GODN) (the “Company” or “Golden Star”) announced today that, on March 6, 2024, it filed a supplement (the “Supplement”) to the definitive proxy statement dated February 7, 2024 (together with the additional proxy statement supplements and annexes, the “Proxy Statement”) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), to amend the monthly fee payable by the sponsor of the Company and/or its designee into the trust account to extend the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination as proposed in the original Proposal 1 to the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders to be held originally on February 27, 2024, from an amount equal to the lesser of (i) $50,000 for all outstanding Public Shares and (ii) $0.033 for each outstanding Public Share as proposed in the original filing, to an amount (the “Amended Monthly Extension Fee”) equal to the lesser of (i) $75,000 and (ii) $0.033 for each outstanding Public Share.

Reports Strong Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results with Total Revenue Growth, New Store Openings, and Positive EBITDA. The company acquired Smokey Bones, expanding its portfolio to 18 brands with $2.5 billion in sales. Despite a decline in same-store sales, the company shows potential for significant EBITDA growth in the future. Positive Total revenue increased by 52.8% in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. System-wide sales grew by 16.5% in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. The company opened 125 new restaurants in 2023, including 29 in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 was $27.0 million, a significant increase from $19.6 million in the same period in 2022. Total revenue for the full fiscal year 2023 increased by 18.0% compared to fiscal 2022. System-wide same-store sales growth was 0.8% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for the full fiscal year 2023 was $91.2 million, up from $88.8 million in fiscal 2022. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results of FAT Brands Inc. indicate a substantial 52.8% increase in total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023, driven by an increase in royalties, company-owned restaurant revenues and manufacturing facility revenues. This growth is particularly notable given the broader economic context where many industries face challenges. The reported system-wide sales growth of 16.5% for the same period suggests that the company's expansion strategy is translating into higher sales volumes.However, the disclosed net loss of $26.2 million reflects ongoing financial pressures despite the growth in revenues. The adjusted EBITDA growth from $19.6 million to $27.0 million is a positive indicator of the company's operating performance, as it excludes non-recurring items and provides a clearer picture of the company's earnings from its core business activities. Investors may view the reduction in losses from operations year-over-year as a sign of improving operational efficiency.From a financial perspective, the aggressive expansion, including the acquisition of Smokey Bones and the signing of over 225 development agreements, presents both opportunities for revenue growth and risks associated with integration and capital expenditure. The company's strategy to deleverage its balance sheet in the future is critical, as a high debt load can be a significant risk factor, especially in uncertain economic times. Market Research Analyst The expansion of FAT Brands, especially the focus on the Twin Peaks brand, reflects a strategic move to capitalize on a franchise model that has shown resilience in the food industry. The reported increase of 33% in Twin Peaks lodges since its acquisition indicates a successful integration and popularity of the concept. The company's ability to sign 225 development agreements in 2023, with a pipeline of 1,100 units, demonstrates strong franchisee interest and potential for significant market penetration.However, the slight decline in system-wide same-store sales by 0.6% could be a point of concern. This metric is often considered a key indicator of a brand's health and customer loyalty, as it measures the performance of existing outlets. A decline might imply that while the overall network is growing, individual store performance could be under pressure, potentially due to market saturation or competitive dynamics.The company's strategy to potentially convert Smokey Bones locations into Twin Peaks lodges could accelerate growth but also requires careful market analysis to avoid cannibalization and ensure that brand positioning remains distinct and compelling to consumers. Economist The reported financial results of FAT Brands must be contextualized within the broader economic environment, which includes factors such as inflationary pressures, consumer spending habits and labor market conditions. The company's growth amidst these conditions could be indicative of strong brand equity and consumer demand for their offerings. The increased revenue from company-owned restaurants suggests that FAT Brands is benefiting from both organic growth and acquisitions.However, the reported net interest expense of $33.3 million, which is part of the total other expense, signals a substantial financial burden that could affect the company's flexibility and profitability in the long term. Rising interest rates could further exacerbate this issue, making debt servicing more expensive and potentially hindering future expansion efforts.The company's focus on deleveraging is a prudent approach in the current economic climate, where high debt levels can be particularly onerous. The ability to successfully manage debt and finance growth sustainably will be crucial for the company's long-term financial health and investor confidence. 03/07/2024 - 04:23 PM Conference call and webcast today at 5:00 p.m. ET LOS ANGELES, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FAT (Fresh. Authentic. Tasty.) Brands Inc. (NASDAQ: FAT) (“FAT Brands” or the “Company”) today reported fiscal fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2023 financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. “With the acquisition of Smokey Bones early in the fourth quarter, we have grown the FAT Brands portfolio to 18 iconic restaurant brands with annualized system wide sales of $2.5 billion,” said Andy Wiederhorn, Chairman of FAT Brands. “We opened 125 restaurants in 2023, including 29 in the fourth quarter. We are seeing strong franchisee interest in development opportunities, having signed more than 225 development agreements in 2023, bringing our total pipeline to 1,100 units. This represents the potential for over 50% EBITDA growth over the next several years.” Ken Kuick, Co-Chief Executive Officer of FAT Brands, commented, “While franchise interest remains high across all of our brands, we continue to be focused on the expansion of Twin Peaks. This year we opened 14 new lodges and ended the year with 109 lodges, a 33% increase since acquiring the brand in 2021. Our growth pipeline includes 113 lodges and Smokey Bones’ healthy real estate portfolio provides us with the opportunity to convert locations into Twin Peaks lodges, with the potential to significantly accelerate the growth of the brand.” Rob Rosen, Co-Chief Executive Officer of FAT Brands, concluded, “We believe there are significant opportunities on the horizon for FAT Brands. Our seasoned leadership and strong brand management platform allow us to efficiently integrate new brands while maintaining a healthy and evolving pipeline for organic growth. These strengths position us for continued growth in the future, which will help deleverage our balance sheet.” Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights Total revenue improved 52.8% to $158.6 million compared to $103.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 System-wide sales growth of 16.5% in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the prior year fiscal quarterSystem-wide same-store sales declined 0.6% in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year29 new store openings during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 Loss from operations of $3.1 million compared to $32.6 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022Net loss of $26.2 million, or $1.68 per diluted share, compared to $70.8 million, or $4.39 per diluted share, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022Adjusted EBITDA(1) of $27.0 million compared to $19.6 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022Adjusted net loss(1) of $17.3 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, compared to $43.0 million, or $2.70 per diluted share, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022 Fiscal Year 2023 Highlights Total revenue increased 18.0% to $480.5 million compared to $407.2 million in fiscal 2022 System-wide sales growth of 6.9% compared to fiscal 2022System-wide same-store sales growth of 0.8% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022125 new store openings during fiscal 2023 Income from operations of $22.3 million compared to loss from operations of $17.9 million in the fiscal quarter of 2022Net loss of $90.1 million, or $5.85 per diluted share, compared to $126.2 million, or $8.06 per diluted share, in fiscal 2022Adjusted EBITDA(1) of $91.2 million compared to $88.8 million in fiscal 2022Adjusted net loss(1) of $56.5 million, or $3.83 per diluted share, compared to $80.9 million, or $5.32 per diluted share, in fiscal 2022 (1) EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss are non-GAAP measures defined below, under “Non-GAAP Measures”.

Summary of Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Total revenue increased $54.8 million, or 52.8%, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, to $158.6 million compared to $103.8 million in the same fiscal period of 2022, driven by a 10.4% increase in royalties, an 80.5% increase in company-owned restaurant revenues driven by new restaurant openings and the acquisition of Smokey Bones during the fourth quarter of 2023 and a 10.0% increase in revenues from our manufacturing facility. Costs and expenses consist of general and administrative expense, cost of restaurant and factory revenues, depreciation and amortization, refranchising net losses and advertising fees. Costs and expenses increased $25.4 million, or 18.6%, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 to $161.8 million compared to $136.4 million in the same fiscal period in the prior fiscal year. General and administrative expense decreased $8.8 million, or 22.6%, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same fiscal period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a $16.6 million non-cash reserve on claimed Employee Retention Credits recorded during the fourth quarter of 2022 and the recognition of $3.4 million related to Employee Retention Credits during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by the acquisition of Smokey Bones in the fourth quarter of 2023 and higher professional fees related to certain litigation matters. Cost of restaurant and factory revenues was related to the operations of the company-owned restaurant locations and our dough factory and increased $43.4 million, or 70.3%, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 to $105.1 million, compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to the acquisition of Smokey Bones in the fourth quarter of 2023. Depreciation and amortization increased $3.0 million, or 42.9% in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same fiscal period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the acquisition of Smokey Bones in the fourth quarter of 2023 and depreciation of new property and equipment at company-owned restaurant locations. Refranchising losses in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022 were $2.1 million and $3.1 million, respectively, and were comprised of restaurant costs and expenses, net of food sales. Advertising expenses increased $2.2 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year period. These expenses vary in relation to advertising revenues. Total other expense, net for the fiscal fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022 was $31.9 million and $24.2 million, respectively, primarily comprised of net interest expense of $33.3 million and $25.6 million, respectively. Adjusted net loss was $17.3 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $43.0 million, or $2.70 per diluted share, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022. Key Financial Definitions New store openings - The number of new store openings reflects the number of stores opened during a particular reporting period. The total number of new stores per reporting period and the timing of stores openings has, and will continue to have, an impact on our results. Same-store sales growth - Same-store sales growth reflects the change in year-over-year sales for the comparable store base, which we define as the number of stores open and in the FAT Brands system for at least one full fiscal year. For stores that were temporarily closed, sales in the current and prior period are adjusted accordingly. Given our focused marketing efforts and public excitement surrounding each opening, new stores often experience an initial start-up period with considerably higher than average sales volumes, which subsequently decrease to stabilized levels after three to six months. Additionally, when we acquire a brand, it may take several months to integrate fully each location of said brand into the FAT Brands platform. Thus, we do not include stores in the comparable base until they have been open and in the FAT Brands system for at least one full fiscal year. System-wide sales growth - System wide sales growth reflects the percentage change in sales in any given fiscal period compared to the prior fiscal period for all stores in that brand only when the brand is owned by FAT Brands. Because of acquisitions, new store openings and store closures, the stores open throughout both fiscal periods being compared may be different from period to period.

Forward-looking statements generally use words such as “expect,” “foresee,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “project,” “should,” “estimate,” “will,” “plans,” “forecast,” and similar expressions, and reflect our expectations concerning the future. Forward-looking statements are subject to significant business, economic and competitive risks, uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are difficult to predict and beyond our control, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. We refer you to the documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as our reports on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, for a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations and from the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this press release. Non-GAAP Measures (Unaudited) This press release includes the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. We use the term EBITDA, as opposed to income from operations, as it is widely used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. We believe that EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of expenses that do not relate to business performance. EBITDA is not a measure of our financial performance or liquidity that is determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as measures of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (as defined above), excluding expenses related to acquisitions, refranchising losses, impairment charges, and certain non-recurring or non-cash items that the Company does not believe directly reflect its core operations and may not be indicative of the Company’s recurring business operations. Adjusted net loss is a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net loss is defined as net loss plus the impact of adjustments and the tax effects of such adjustments. Adjusted net loss is presented because we believe it helps convey supplemental information to investors regarding our performance, excluding the impact of special items that affect the comparability of results in past quarters to expected results in future quarters. Adjusted net loss as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, and our presentation of adjusted net loss should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by excluded or unusual items. Our management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to analyze changes in our underlying business from quarter to quarter based on comparable financial results. Reconciliations of net loss presented in accordance with GAAP to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss are set forth in the tables below.

Reports Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2023 Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary The Joint Corp. (NASDAQ: JYNT) reported strong financial results for Q4 2023 and full year 2023, with revenue growing by 16% to $117.7 million. They also increased clinic count to 935 and initiated a refranchising program. Despite revenue growth, they reported a net loss of $9.8 million for 2023. The company aims to drive growth through marketing initiatives and refranchising efforts to strengthen their franchise network. Positive Revenue grew by 16% to $117.7 million in 2023 compared to 2022. Increased clinic count to 935 by year-end 2023. Initiated a refranchising program to increase bottom line and cash flow. Recorded a net loss of $9.8 million for 2023 despite revenue growth. Reported Adjusted EBITDA of $12.2 million in 2023. Performed 13.6 million patient visits in 2023. Negative Net loss of $9.8 million reported for 2023. Operating loss of $2.1 million in 2023 compared to operating income of $828,000 in 2022. Decrease in system-wide comp sales from 9% in 2022 to 4% in 2023. Sold 55 franchise licenses in 2023 compared to 75 in 2022. Closed 13 franchised clinics in 2023. Financial Analyst The Joint Corp.'s announcement delineates a mixed financial performance. The 16% revenue growth year-over-year indicates a robust expansion strategy, likely driven by an increase in clinic count and patient visits. However, the reported net loss, including a significant non-cash valuation allowance, suggests a need for careful financial scrutiny. This allowance could be indicative of the company's reassessment of its deferred tax assets, which may not be realizable in the foreseeable future, often a sign of conservative accounting practices or a response to changing business prospects.Investors should note the refranchising program initiation, as it may impact future earnings through changes in capital expenditure and operating costs. The shift from corporate-owned to franchised clinics typically reduces capital requirements and stabilizes cash flows, making it a strategic move to bolster financial health. However, it also transfers some control and potential profits to franchisees.While the Adjusted EBITDA remained stable, it's essential to understand that this metric excludes non-cash and irregular expenses and may not fully represent the company's cash flow position. The increase in unrestricted cash is positive but must be weighed against the net loss to understand the company's liquidity and operational efficiency. Market Research Analyst The Joint Corp.'s performance in the context of the broader healthcare services market suggests a continued demand for chiropractic services. The increase in patient visits and new patient treatments highlights the market's receptivity to The Joint's services. However, the slower growth in system-wide sales compared to the previous year and the reduction in the number of new franchised licenses sold may signal a maturing market or increased competition.Marketing initiatives aimed at driving top-line growth through new patient count and patient engagement will be crucial in maintaining a competitive edge. The healthcare sector is increasingly consumer-centric and The Joint's focus on patient conversion and retention rates reflects industry trends towards enhancing patient experience and loyalty.The refranchising strategy aligns with current market trends where businesses in the service sector are moving towards asset-light models to improve scalability and financial performance. However, the mid-single digits growth expectation in system-wide comp sales for 2024 may suggest cautious optimism, potentially reflecting market saturation or an increasingly competitive landscape. Economist From an economic perspective, The Joint Corp.'s financial results can be interpreted as a response to macroeconomic conditions. The tight labor market mentioned in the report is likely exerting upward pressure on wages, contributing to increased general and administrative expenses. This scenario is consistent with broader economic trends of labor shortages and wage inflation in several sectors.The company's refranchising initiative and modified financial guidance metrics indicate strategic adaptations to an uncertain economic environment. By focusing on system-wide gross sales and sales comps, The Joint is emphasizing metrics that may provide a clearer picture of its operational health in a fluctuating economy.The decision to refranchise could also be seen as a move to mitigate risks associated with economic downturns, as it transfers operational risks to franchisees and may create a more variable cost structure. In the long term, this could position the company to better withstand economic headwinds while capitalizing on growth during economic expansions. 03/07/2024 - 04:20 PM - Grew 2023 Revenue 16%, System-wide Sales 12%, and System-wide Comp Sales 4% vs. 2022 - - Increased Clinic Count to 935 at Year-end 2023, Initiating Refranchising Program - SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Joint Corp.

Franchised clinics: Opened 104, closed 13, and sold three to corporate, bringing the total to 800 franchised clinics in operation at December 31, 2023, compared to 712 at December 31, 2022.Company-owned or managed clinics: Opened 10, closed four, and acquired three, bringing the total to 135 company-owned or managed clinics in operation at December 31, 2023, compared to 126 at December 31, 2022. _____________________________________ 1 System-wide sales include revenues at all clinics, whether operated or managed by the company or by franchisees. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the company, management believes the information is important in understanding the company’s financial performance, because these revenues are the basis on which the company calculates and records royalty fees and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. 2 Comp sales include the revenues from both company-owned or managed clinics and franchised clinics that in each case have been open at least 13 full months and exclude any clinics that have closed. “During 2023, our team delivered growth in system-wide sales, revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, the number of patient visits, and the number of patients treated as well as improved new patient conversion and existing patient attrition rates in a market of ongoing uncertainty among our patient demographic,” said Peter D. Holt, President and Chief Executive Officer of The Joint Corp. “Yet, we aim to do better and are implementing marketing initiatives to drive top-line growth through increased new patient count and patient engagement. Simultaneously, we are refranchising the majority of our corporate clinics, which we expect to ultimately increase our bottom line and cash flow. These actions will create opportunities for us to reinvest in The Joint and strengthen the health of our franchise network. As we advance our vision to be the Champions of Chiropractic, we expect to generate value for all of our stakeholders.” Financial Results for Fourth Quarter Ended December 31: 2023 Compared to 2022 Revenue was $30.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $27.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase reflects a greater number of franchised and corporate clinics and continued organic growth. Cost of revenue was $2.9 million, compared to $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting the associated higher regional developer royalties and commissions. Selling and marketing expenses were $3.4 million, up 2%, reflecting cost management efforts and the timing of the national marketing fund. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased 18% for the fourth quarter of 2023, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the impact of corporate clinics that are being held for sale in connection with the refranchising efforts. General and administrative expenses were $21.3 million, compared to $18.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting increases in costs to support clinic growth and in payroll to remain competitive in the tight labor market. Loss on disposition or impairment was $1.5 million dollars, compared to $50,000 in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase is related to our refranchising efforts, which includes those additional corporate clinics that were announced to be held for sale in November 2023. Operating loss, including the aforementioned impairment charge, was $147,000, compared to operating income of $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Income tax expense, including non-cash valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets of $10.8 million, was $10.9 million. This compares to income tax expense of $629,000 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net loss including the non-cash valuation allowance was $11.0 million, or $0.75 per basic share. This compares to net income of $763,000, or $0.05 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.0 million for both the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022. Financial Results for Year Ended December 31: 2023 Compared to 2022 Revenue was $117.7 million in 2023, compared to $101.3 million in 2022. Net loss including the non-cash valuation allowance was $9.8 million, or $0.66 per basic share. This compares to 2022 net income of $627,000, or $0.04 per diluted share. Balance Sheet LiquidityUnrestricted cash was $18.2 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $9.7 million at December 31, 2022. The increase during 2023 reflects $14.7 million cash flow from operations, including the receipt of the employee retention credits of $4.8 million, partially offset by $6.2 million invested in clinic acquisitions, development of greenfield clinics, and improvements of existing clinics and corporate assets. 2024 Guidance Because the timing of the corporate clinic sales is uncertain and will impact revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, the company has modified the financial guidance metrics to be system-wide gross sales and system-wide sales comps. The company will continue to provide guidance on new franchise openings excluding the impact of refranchised clinics. 2024 System-wide sales are expected to be between $530 and $545 million dollars, compared to $488.0 million dollars in 2023.System-wide comp sales for all clinics open 13 months or more are expected to be in the mid-single digits in 2024.2024 new franchised clinic openings, excluding the impact of refranchised clinics, are expected to be between 60 and 75, compared to 104 in 2023.

Commonly Discussed Performance MetricsThis release includes a presentation of commonly discussed performance metrics. System-wide sales include revenues at all clinics, whether operated by the company or by franchisees. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the company, management believes the information is important in understanding the company’s financial performance, because these sales are the basis on which the company calculates and records royalty fees and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. System-wide comp sales include the revenues from both company-owned or managed clinics and franchised clinics that in each case have been open at least 13 full months and exclude any clinics that have closed. Non-GAAP Financial Information This release also includes a presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented because they are important measures used by management to assess financial performance, as management believes they provide a more transparent view of the company’s underlying operating performance and operating trends. Reconciliation of historical net income/(loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is presented in the table below. The company defines EBITDA as net income/(loss) before net interest, tax expense, depreciation, and amortization expenses. The company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before acquisition-related expenses (which includes contract termination costs associated with reacquired regional developer rights), net (gain)/loss on disposition or impairment, stock-based compensation expenses, costs related to restatement filings, restructuring costs and other income related to employee retention credits. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered alternatives to net income or cash flows from operations, as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used as measures of financial performance and the ability to meet debt service requirements, they are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be reviewed in conjunction with the company’s financial statements filed with the SEC.

Forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and expectations of industry trends, our future financial and operating performance and our growth plans, taking into account the information currently available to us.

Specific forward looking statements made in this press release include, among others, our aim to do better and our implementation of marketing initiatives to drive top-line growth through increased new patient count and patient engagement; our expectation that refranchising of the majority of our corporate clinics will ultimately increase our bottom line and cash flow; our belief that such actions will create opportunities for us to reinvest in The Joint and strengthen the health of our franchise network; our expectation that as we advance our vision to be the Champions of Chiropractic, we will generate value for all of our stakeholders; our expectation of high variability timing of the corporate clinic sales and their impact to revenue and Adjusted EBITDA during the execution of the refranchising strategy; our plan to continue to provide guidance on new franchise openings excluding the impact of refranchised clinics; and our expectations for 2024 system-wide sales, system-wide comp sales, and new franchised clinic openings, excluding the impact of refranchised clinics. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations of future results we express or imply in any forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements. Factors that could contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, our inability to identify and recruit enough qualified chiropractors and other personnel to staff our clinics, due in part to the nationwide labor shortage and an increase in operating expenses due to measures we may need to take to address such shortage; inflation, which has increased our costs and which could otherwise negatively impact our business; our failure to profitably operate company-owned or managed clinics; our failure to refranchise as planned; short-selling strategies and negative opinions posted on the internet, which could drive down the market price of our common stock and result in class action lawsuits; our failure to remediate future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which could negatively impact our ability to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or maintain investor confidence; and other factors described in our filings with the SEC, including in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on September 26, 2023 and subsequently-filed current and quarterly reports. We qualify any forward-looking statements entirely by these cautionary factors.

Market Research Analyst The reported full-year financials for Taseko Mines Limited show a substantial increase in revenues and net income, indicating a strong performance, particularly in copper production. The 34% revenue increase and the rise in Adjusted EBITDA to $190 million reflect improved operational efficiency and the strategic acquisition of an increased stake in the Gibraltar Mine. These financial metrics are crucial for investors as they provide insight into the company's profitability and its ability to generate cash flow from its core mining operations. The reported net income of $83 million, alongside the Adjusted net earnings of $44 million, suggests robust financial health and may influence investor confidence positively. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the increase in Taseko's effective interest from 75% to 87.5% in the Gibraltar Mine is a significant contributor to the company's revenue growth. This strategic move not only enhances Taseko's asset base but also increases its potential future earnings from the mine. Additionally, the lower Total operating cash costs (C1) of US$1.91 per pound in the fourth quarter and US$2.37 per pound for the year suggest that Taseko is effectively managing its operational expenses, which is a positive indicator for margin improvement and cost competitiveness in the copper market. This cost management is particularly relevant given the volatile nature of commodity prices. Mining Industry Analyst The operational data, including the 26% increase in annual copper production and the higher copper grades averaging 0.27% for the fourth quarter, indicate that Taseko's mining operations are extracting higher-quality ore. This operational excellence can be attributed to the lower benches of the Gibraltar pit, which have delivered as expected. Furthermore, the successful permitting and planned construction of the commercial production facility at Florence, with first copper production expected in Q4 2025, represent significant future growth opportunities. These developments could potentially increase Taseko's market share in the copper industry and contribute to long-term sustainability. 03/07/2024 - 07:20 PM This release should be read with the Company's Financial Statements and Management Discussion & Analysis (""MD&A""), available at www.tasekomines.com and filed on www.sedar.com. Except where otherwise noted, all currency amounts are stated in Canadian dollars. Taseko's 87.5% owned Gibraltar Mine is located north of the City of Williams Lake in south-central British Columbia.

VANCOUVER, BC, March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Taseko Mines Limited (TSX: TKO) (NYSE American: TGB) (LSE: TKO) (""Taseko"" or the ""Company"") reports full year 2023 Adjusted EBITDA* of $190 million and Earnings from mining operations before depletion and amortization* of $207 million. Revenues for 2023 were $525 million, 34% higher than the prior year as a result of improved copper production and an increase in the Company's effective interest in the Gibraltar Mine, from 75% to 87.5%, in March 2023. Net income for the year was $83 million ($0.29 per share) and Adjusted net earnings* were $44 million ($0.15 per share). In the fourth quarter, Adjusted EBITDA* was $69 million and Earnings from mining operations before depletion and amortization* was $73 million. Net income for the fourth quarter was $67 million ($0.23 per share) and Adjusted net earnings* was $24 million ($0.08 per share). Fourth quarter copper production from Gibraltar was 34 million pounds, and for the full year 2023 production was 123 million pounds. Annual production was above the Company's original guidance and also 26% higher than in 2022. Strong production supported lower Total operating cash costs (C1)* of US$1.91 per pound for the fourth quarter and US$2.37 per pound for the year. Molybdenum production for the fourth quarter and year was 369 thousand pounds and 1.2 million pounds, respectively. Stuart McDonald, President and CEO of Taseko, commented, ""The Gibraltar Mine finished a successful year with another strong production quarter. The lower benches of the Gibraltar pit continued to deliver the quality ore we expected, with copper grades averaging 0.27% for the period. This resulted in strong earnings and $63 million of operating cash flow in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2023, the average copper grade was 0.25%, which is in line with Gibraltar's life of mine reserve grade, and led to significantly improved copper production and financial performance compared to 2022. ""At our Florence Copper project we achieved a major milestone in the fourth quarter, as the final Underground Injection Control permit became effective, successfully concluding the EPA's lengthy permitting process. We also announced two Florence project financings totalling US$100 million, from Taurus Mining Royalty Fund and Societe Generale, which supplement the previously announced financings from Mitsui and Bank of America. We're now moving forward with construction of the commercial production facility at Florence. Initial activities have focused on site preparations, earthworks and civil work for the wellfield as well as hiring additional site personnel for the construction and operations teams. Wellfield drilling commenced in February and construction of the SX/EW plant and other surface infrastructure will begin in the second quarter. First copper production expected in fourth quarter 2025."" Mr. McDonald added, ""Taseko is in a very unique position heading into 2024 with a fully permitted, low-cost project that will provide 80% growth to our North American copper production profile in the coming years. Our Gibraltar Mine is expected to continue to benefit from Gibraltar pit ore which will be the main source of mill feed for the first half of this year, before the transition to the Connector pit. In January, we had mill downtime in concentrator #2 for a planned major component replacement, which was successfully completed in the scheduled timeframe. In the second quarter, concentrator #1 will be shut down for roughly three weeks for the in-pit crusher relocation and other mill maintenance. Factoring in the additional down time in 2024, we expect Gibraltar to produce approximately 115 million pounds of copper for the year, with quarterly production less variable than in recent years,"" concluded Mr. McDonald. 2023 Annual ReviewAnnual cash flow from operations was $151.1 million and net income was $82.7 million ($0.29 per share) for the year;Earnings from mining operations before depletion and amortization* was $207.4 million, Adjusted EBITDA* was $190.1 million and Adjusted net income* was $44.4 million ($0.15 per share);Total operating costs (C1)* for the year was US$2.37 per pound produced;The Gibraltar mine produced 122.6 million pounds of copper and 1.2 million pounds of molybdenum in 2023.

See end of news release Operations Analysis Full Year Results Gibraltar produced 122.6 million pounds of copper for the year compared to 97.0 million pounds in 2022. The higher production was attributable to improved ore grades and recoveries as the lower benches of the Gibraltar pit provided the expected higher grades and more consistent mineralized zones. Copper grades for the year averaged 0.25% copper compared to 0.20% in 2022 and copper recoveries for 2023 were 82.6% compared to 79.5% in 2022. A total of 88.1 million tons were mined in the year compared to 88.7 million tons mined in 2022. The strip ratio of 1.3 was lower than the prior year as mining operations were focused in the Gibraltar pit in 2023 which has a lower strip ratio. Ore stockpiles also increased by 9.1 million tons, including oxide ore from the upper benches of the Connector pit. Total site costs* at Gibraltar of $430.7 million (which includes capitalized stripping of $55.6 million) was $28.3 million higher than 2022, primarily due to higher repairs and maintenance costs and labour costs, partially offset by lower diesel costs and lower grinding media costs. Molybdenum production was 1.2 million pounds in the year compared to 1.1 million pounds in the prior year. Molybdenum prices strengthened in 2023 with an average molybdenum price of US$24.19 per pound, an increase of 29% compared to the 2022 average price of US$18.73 per pound. Off-property costs per pound produced* were US$0.38 for the year, which is US$0.02 higher than the prior year primarily due to an increase in treatment and refining charges (TCRC) rates. Total operating costs per pound produced (C1)* was US$2.37 for the year, compared to US$2.98 in the prior year as shown in the bridge graph below: *Non-GAAP performance measure. See end of news release Operations Analysis - ContinuedFourth Quarter Results Gibraltar produced 34.2 million pounds of copper for the quarter which was generally consistent with the prior quarter. Slightly lower throughput of 7.6 million tons was offset by higher grade compared to the prior quarter. Copper grades in the fourth quarter were 0.27%, higher than recent quarters and in line with management expectations as the lower benches of the Gibraltar pit provided higher grades and more consistent mineralized zones. Copper recoveries in the fourth quarter were 82.2% and were impacted by performance in concentrator #2 prior to a major component replacement that was completed in January. Total site costs* at Gibraltar of $110.6 million (which includes capitalized stripping of $31.9 million) was $8.6 million higher than the prior quarter due to higher labor cost, grinding media cost and timing of repairs and maintenance. Site operating cost per ton milled* was $9.72 and was lower than the previous quarters in 2023 mainly due to higher capitalized stripping costs. Molybdenum production was 369 thousand pounds in the fourth quarter. At an average molybdenum price of US$18.64 per pound and the impact of negative price adjustments of $1.8 million for Taseko's 87.5% share, molybdenum generated a by-product credit per pound of copper produced of US$0.13 in the fourth quarter. Off-property costs per pound produced* were US$0.45 for the fourth quarter reflecting higher sales, higher ocean freight costs (including bunker fuel) and increased TCRCs compared to the same quarter in the prior year. Total operating costs per pound produced (C1)* was US$1.91 for the quarter and was lower than the previous quarter due to increased waste stripping costs being capitalized from the Connector pit. Gibraltar OutlookThe Gibraltar pit will continue to be the main source of mill feed for the first half of 2024 before mining of ore transitions into the Connector pit in the second half of the year. Stripping activity will continue to be focused in the Connector pit, and further oxide ore from this pit is expected to be added to the leach pads in 2024. Restart of the SX/EW facility at the Gibraltar mine is expected in 2026. Concentrator #2 had additional downtime in January 2024 for a planned major component replacement, and concentrator #1 is scheduled to be down for three weeks in June for the in-pit crusher relocation and other mill maintenance. After taking into account the reduced mill availability from these two scheduled down times, total copper production at Gibraltar for 2024 is expected to be approximately 115 million pounds. The estimated remaining capital cost of the crusher relocation project is $10 million, and no other significant capital projects are planned for Gibraltar in 2024. The Company continues to purchase options to provide copper price and fuel price protection. Currently, the Company has copper put contracts in place that secure a minimum copper price of US$3.25 per pound for 42 million pounds of copper and diesel call options for 12.5 million litres of diesel, covering the first half of 2024. *Non-GAAP performance measure. See end of news release Florence CopperOn September 14, 2023, the Company received the final UIC permit from the EPA, and the UIC permit became effective on October 31, 2023. The Company now has all the key permits in place for the commercial production facility and is commencing construction. Site activities to-date have focused on site preparations, earthworks and civil work for the commercial wellfield and the hiring of additional management and site personnel positions for the construction and operations teams. The initial drilling contracts have been awarded and finalized, and drilling of the commercial facility wellfield commenced in February. The Company recently executed a fixed-price contract with the general contractor for construction of the SX/EW plant and associated surface infrastructure which is scheduled to commence in the second quarter of 2024. All the major plant components are on site and the early work on detailed engineering and procurement of long-lead items has significantly de-risked the construction schedule. First copper production is expected in the fourth quarter of 2025. The Company has advanced Florence project level financing to fund construction. In the fourth quarter, the Company closed a US$25 million equipment loan with Bank of America. In January 2024, the Company received the initial US$10 million deposit from the US$50 million streaming transaction with Mitsui. The remaining amounts will be paid on a quarterly basis in US$10 million instalments. On February 2, 2024, the Company closed a US$50 million royalty with Taurus, which was funded in one lump-sum payment at that time. Additionally, in October 2023, the Florence project received a credit committee approved commitment from Societe Generale for a US$50 million project debt facility with an additional US$25 million uncommitted accordion feature. In March 2023, the Company announced the results of recent technical work and updated economics for the Florence Copper project. The Company has a technical report entitled ""NI 43-101 Technical Report Florence Copper Project, Pinal County, Arizona"" dated March 30, 2023 (the ""Technical Report"") on SEDAR. The Technical Report was prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 and incorporates updated capital and operating costs (with a basis as of Q3 2022) for the commercial production facility and refinements made to the operating models, based on the Production Test Facility (""PTF"") results.

(""Yellowhead"") has an 817 million tonnes reserve and a 25-year mine life with a pre-tax net present value of $1.3 billion at an 8% discount rate using a US$3.10 per pound copper price based on the Company's 2020 NI 43-101 technical report. Capital costs of the project are estimated at $1.3 billion over a 2-year construction period. During the first 5 years of operation, the copper equivalent grade will average 0.35% producing an average of 200 million pounds of copper per year at an average C1* cost, net of by-product credit, of US$1.67 per pound of copper produced. The Yellowhead copper project contains valuable precious metal by-products with 440,000 ounces of gold and 19 million ounces of silver with a life of mine value of over $1 billion at current prices. The Company is preparing to advance into the environmental assessment process and is undertaking some additional engineering work in conjunction with ongoing engagement with local communities including First Nations. The Company is also collecting baseline data and modeling which will be used to support the environmental assessment and permitting of the project. New Prosperity Gold-Copper Project In late 2019, the Tŝilhqot'in Nation, as represented by Tŝilhqot'in National Government, and Taseko Mines Limited entered into a confidential dialogue, with the involvement of the Province of British Columbia, seeking a long-term resolution of the conflict regarding Taseko's proposed copper-gold mine previously known as New Prosperity, acknowledging Taseko's commercial interests and the Tŝilhqot'in Nation's opposition to the project. This dialogue has been supported by the parties' agreement, beginning December 2019, to a series of standstill agreements on certain outstanding litigation and regulatory matters relating to Taseko's tenures and the area in the vicinity of Teztan Biny (Fish Lake). The dialogue process has made meaningful progress in recent months but is not complete. The Tŝilhqot'in Nation and Taseko acknowledge the constructive nature of discussions, and the opportunity to conclude a long-term and mutually acceptable resolution of the conflict that also makes an important contribution to the goals of reconciliation in Canada. In March 2024, Tŝilhqot'in and Taseko formally reinstated the standstill agreement for a final term, with the goal of finalizing a resolution before the end of this year. Aley Niobium Project Environmental monitoring and product marketing initiatives on the Aley niobium project continue. The converter pilot test is ongoing and is providing additional process data to support the design of the commercial process facilities and will provide final product samples for marketing purposes. The Company has also initiated a scoping study to investigate the potential production of niobium oxide at Aley to supply the growing market for niobium-based batteries. Environmental, Social and Governance (""ESG"")Nothing is more important to Taseko than the safety, health and well-being of our workers and their families. Taseko places a high priority on the continuous improvement of performance in the areas of employee health and safety at the workplace and protection of the environment. The full report is available on the Company's website at https://tasekomines.com/sustainability/overview/. Taseko's 2023 ESG report will be published in the second quarter of 2024. Market Review Prices (USD per pound for Commodities) (Source Data: Bank of Canada, Platts Metals, and London Metals Exchange) Copper prices are currently around US$3.90 per pound, compared to US$3.84 per pound at December 31, 2023. Short-term volatility in copper prices is expected to continue in the near term due to macroeconomic uncertainty, geopolitical events and recessionary risks from higher interest rates which is causing a slowdown in industrial demand. Electrification of transportation and the focus on government investment in construction and infrastructure including initiatives focused on the renewable energy, electrification and meeting net zero targets by 2050, are inherently copper intensive and supports higher copper prices in the longer term. According to S&P Global's copper market outlook report published in July 2022, titled 'The Future of Copper: Will the looming supply gap short-circuit the energy transition?', global demand for copper is projected to double from approximately 25 million metric tons today to roughly 50 million metric tons by 2035, a record high that will be sustained and continue to grow to 53 million metric tons by 2050, in order to achieve net-zero targets. All of these factors continue to provide unprecedented catalysts for higher copper prices in the future as new mine supply lags growth in copper demand. Approximately 4% of the Company's revenue is made up of molybdenum sales. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the average molybdenum price was US$18.64 per pound. Molybdenum prices are currently around US$20 per pound. Molybdenum demand and prices have been driven by supply challenges at large South American copper mines that produce molybdenum as a by-product. Continued strong demand from the energy sector has boosted demand for alloyed steel products, as well as growing demand from the renewables and military sectors. The Company's sales agreements specify molybdenum pricing based on the published Platts Metals reports. Approximately 80% of the Gibraltar mine's costs are Canadian dollar denominated and therefore, fluctuations in the Canadian/US dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on the Company's financial results. The Company will host a telephone conference call and live webcast on Friday, March 8, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (8:00 a.m. Pacific Time) to discuss these results.

Stuart McDonaldPresident & CEO Non-GAAP Performance MeasuresThis document includes certain non-GAAP performance measures that do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. These measures may differ from those used by, and may not be comparable to such measures as reported by, other issuers. The Company believes that these measures are commonly used by certain investors, in conjunction with conventional IFRS measures, to enhance their understanding of the Company's performance. These measures have been derived from the Company's financial statements and applied on a consistent basis. The following tables below provide a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measure. Total operating costs and site operating costs, net of by-product credits Total costs of sales include all costs absorbed into inventory, as well as transportation costs and insurance recoverable. Site operating costs are calculated by removing net changes in inventory, depletion and amortization, insurance recoverable, and transportation costs from cost of sales. Site operating costs, net of by-product credits is calculated by subtracting by-product credits from the site operating costs. Site operating costs, net of by-product credits per pound are calculated by dividing the aggregate of the applicable costs by copper pounds produced. Total operating costs per pound is the sum of site operating costs, net of by-product credits and off-property costs divided by the copper pounds produced.

The Company's Board of Directors approves twelfth stock repurchase program for up to 60,000 shares in 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The regulatory approval for Home Federal Bank to pay dividends to its holding company, Home Federal Bancorp, Inc., represents a significant liquidity event. This infusion of $10 million, distributed over four quarters, provides the holding company with a substantial capital resource. The immediate implication for stakeholders is the potential for enhanced shareholder value through the announced uses of these funds: operational financing, stock repurchases and shareholder dividends. Stock repurchase programs like the one announced can often lead to an increase in the stock's price by reducing the number of shares outstanding, thus potentially increasing earnings per share (EPS).However, the repurchase of 2.0% of outstanding common stock must be scrutinized against the backdrop of the company's overall capital strategy. While repurchases can signal management's confidence in the company's valuation, they also represent an opportunity cost. Capital not invested in growth or operational improvements could be seen as a lack of viable investment opportunities within the company or its market. Investors should consider the long-term growth prospects of Home Federal Bancorp in light of this capital allocation decision. Market Research Analyst The banking sector often utilizes stock repurchase programs as a method to return value to shareholders and manage equity levels. Home Federal Bancorp's decision to implement its twelfth stock repurchase program without an expiration date provides flexibility in capital management. This strategy can be particularly effective in managing market perceptions during volatile periods. By analyzing the program's scale relative to the company's market capitalization, investors can gauge its potential impact on the market price.It is also crucial to consider the regional market dynamics of northwest Louisiana where Home Federal Bank operates. The economic health of this region, including factors like employment rates, real estate markets and business growth, will influence the bank's performance. Understanding these local economic indicators can provide insights into the potential success of the bank's strategic initiatives, including the efficacy of the dividend payments and stock repurchase program in creating shareholder value. Legal Expert The regulatory approval for dividend payments from Home Federal Bank to Home Federal Bancorp, Inc. underscores the importance of regulatory compliance in the financial industry. This approval is a testament to the bank's adherence to the stringent capital requirements and oversight imposed by financial regulators. For stakeholders, this regulatory milestone can be seen as an indicator of the bank's financial health and regulatory standing.Additionally, the structure of the dividend payments, set to be distributed over four installments, suggests a planned approach to capital distribution that aims to maintain stability and regulatory compliance over time. The absence of an expiration date for the stock repurchase program allows for strategic flexibility, but also requires ongoing legal and regulatory oversight to ensure continued compliance with market regulations and to prevent market manipulation. 03/07/2024 - 06:00 PM SHREVEPORT, La., March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Home Federal Bancorp, Inc. of Louisiana (the “Company”) (NASDAQ: HFBL), the holding company for Home Federal Bank, announced today that Home Federal Bank had received regulatory approval for the payment of $10.0 million of dividends from the Bank to the Company.

In addition, the Company announced today that its Board of Directors on March 7, 2024, approved the Company’s twelfth stock repurchase program. The new repurchase program provides for the repurchase of up to 60,000 shares, or approximately 2.0% of the Company’s outstanding common stock from time to time, in open market or privately negotiated transactions. The stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date.

The company is restoring key systems, offering funding support for providers, and implementing actions to support patients. CEO Andrew Witty emphasizes commitment to recovery and ensuring access to care and medications. No other UnitedHealth Group systems are affected. Immediate actions include timelines for system restoration, funding assistance programs for providers, and consumer support initiatives. Positive UnitedHealth Group is actively working on restoring key system functionalities such as pharmacy services, electronic payment platforms, and medical claims processing. The company is providing funding support for community-based providers impacted by the cyberattack, including advancing funds to bridge the gap in short-term cash flow needs. Consumer actions include suspending prior authorizations for outpatient services for Medicare Advantage plans and temporary suspension of drug formulary exception review processes for Medicare Part D pharmacy benefits. Prescription support is being provided to ensure patients have access to medications, with major pharmacy claims and payment systems back up and functioning. UnitedHealth Group expects to exclude the principal impacts of the cyberattack from adjusted earnings. Negative None. Cybersecurity Expert The cyberattack on UnitedHealth Group's Change Healthcare claims and payment infrastructure highlights the critical importance of cybersecurity in safeguarding healthcare systems. The attack's disruption of pharmacy, medical claims and payment systems underscores the vulnerability of such infrastructures to malicious activities. The proactive steps taken to restore services and the implementation of workarounds, such as the new iEDI claim submission system, demonstrate a robust incident response strategy. However, the long-term implications may include increased investments in cybersecurity measures and potential regulatory scrutiny to ensure the protection of sensitive health data. Financial Analyst The financial implications of the cyberattack on UnitedHealth Group are multifaceted. While the immediate restoration of services and the establishment of funding programs to support affected providers show a commitment to mitigating short-term impacts, the financial strain on cash flows and the potential reputational damage could influence investor sentiment. The decision to exclude the principal impacts from adjusted earnings suggests an effort to provide clarity to investors about the company's core financial performance, separate from the extraordinary expenses associated with the cyberattack. Monitoring the company's subsequent earnings reports will be key to understanding the full financial impact. Healthcare Policy Analyst The temporary suspension of prior authorizations and utilization review for certain services by UnitedHealth Group in response to the cyberattack reflects an immediate need to ensure continuity of care. This decision, while necessary, may have broader implications for healthcare policy, such as highlighting the need for more flexible regulatory frameworks during crises. Additionally, the collaboration with state Medicaid agencies indicates an awareness of the interconnectedness of healthcare entities and the importance of a coordinated response to maintain patient care standards during disruptions. 03/07/2024 - 07:15 PM Timeline provided to restore key Change Healthcare systems Additional funding support for providers most impacted Actions to support patients UnitedHealth Group continues to make substantial progress in mitigating the impact to consumers and care providers of the unprecedented cyberattack on the U.S. health system and the Change Healthcare claims and payment infrastructure. Our focus has been on ensuring access to care and medications by addressing challenges to pharmacy, medical claims and payment systems targeted by the attack. “We are committed to providing relief for people affected by this malicious attack on the U.S. health system,” said Andrew Witty, CEO of UnitedHealth Group. “All of us at UnitedHealth Group feel a deep sense of responsibility for recovery and are working tirelessly to ensure that providers can care for their patients and run their practices, and that patients can get their medications. We’re determined to make this right as fast as possible.” Based on our ongoing investigation, there is no indication that any other UnitedHealth Group systems have been affected by this attack. To address the needs of our customers, the company is announcing the following immediate actions: Timeline to Restore Change Healthcare Systems We are working aggressively on the restoration of our systems and services. Assuming we continue at our current rate of progress, we expect our key system functionality to be restored and available on the following timelines: Pharmacy services: Electronic prescribing is now fully functional with claim submission and payment transmission also available as of today. We have taken action to make sure patients can access their medicines in the meantime, including Optum Rx pharmacies sending members their medications based on the date needed. Payments platform: Electronic payment functionality will be available for connection beginning March 15. Medical claims: We expect to begin testing and reestablish connectivity to our claims network and software on March 18, restoring service through that week. While we work to restore these systems, we strongly recommend our provider and payer clients use the applicable workarounds we have established—in particular, using our new iEDI claim submission system in the interest of system redundancy given the current environment. Continued Funding Support for Community-Based Providers On March 1, Optum launched a Temporary Funding Assistance Program to help bridge the gap in short-term cash flow needs for providers who received payments from payers that were processed by Change Healthcare. UnitedHealthcare will provide further funding solutions for its provider partners. This applies to medical, dental and vision providers and will involve advancing funds each week representing the difference between their historical payment levels and the payment levels post attack. Advances will not need to be repaid until claims flows have fully resumed. Providers must complete a one-time registration to access funding. We urge all payers to do the same as this is the fastest, most efficient way to address provider short-term cash flow needs. UnitedHealthcare does not have visibility to the extent of business interruption for each provider; therefore, it is necessary for other payers to participate in a similar manner. We recognize these programs will not work for everyone. Beyond UnitedHealthcare’s provider funding relief, Optum is expanding its funding program to include providers who have exhausted all available connection options, and who work with a payer who has opted not to advance funds to providers during the period when Change Healthcare systems remain down. This expansion is a funding mechanism of last resort, especially for small and regional providers, and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. An Optum Pay account is required to complete registration and to receive funds and repay funds. Use your existing Optum Pay account or sign up for Optum Pay to login. For those who receive funding support, there are no fees, interest or other associated costs with the assistance. For repayment, providers will receive an invoice once standard payment operations resume and will have 30 days to return the funds. These terms now apply to both the original and expanded funding programs. To determine eligibility and funding amount, please register for the program at the website: www.optum.com/temporaryfunding. Additional Consumer Actions For Medicare Advantage plans, including Dual Special Needs Plans, we are temporarily suspending prior authorizations for most outpatient services except for Durable Medical Equipment, cosmetic procedures and Part B step therapies. We also are temporarily suspending utilization review for MA inpatient admissions. For Medicare Part D pharmacy benefits, we are temporarily suspending drug formulary exception review processes. These actions will remain in place until March 31. We will work with state Medicaid agencies on any actions they wish to implement. Prescription Support As of today, all major pharmacy claims and payment systems are back up and functioning. We have taken action to make sure patients can access their medicines in the meantime, including Optum Rx pharmacies sending members their medications based on the date needed. Additionally, recognizing that we were asking pharmacies to take action to help patients, Optum Rx PBM notified network pharmacy partners and pharmacy associations that we would reimburse all appropriate pharmacy claims filled with the good faith understanding that a medication would be covered. We continue to focus on those remaining areas of pharmacy disruption, including specialty coupon programs and certain claims for infusion providers.

Further InformationFor comprehensive disclosure of Parkit's performance for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and its financial position as at such date, please see Parkit's Annual Audited Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.Non-IFRS MeasuresManagement uses both IFRS and Non-IFRS Measures to assess the financial and operating performance of the Company's operations. These Non-IFRS Measures are not recognized measures under IFRS, do not have a standardized meaning under IFRS and are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Non-IFRS Measures referenced in this news release include the following:Funds from Operations (""FFO"") is a Non-IFRS Measure of operating performance as it focuses on cash flow from operating activities. REALPAC is the national industry association dedicated to advancing the long-term vitality of Canada's real property sector. REALPAC defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with IFRS), adjusted for, among other things, depreciation, transaction costs, gains and losses from property dispositions, foreign exchange, as well as other non-cash items. The Company believes that FFO can be a beneficial measure, when combined with primary ‎IFRS measures, to assist in the evaluation of the Company's ability to generate cash and ‎evaluate its return on investments as it excludes the effects of real estate amortization and ‎gains and losses from the sale of real estate, all of which are based on historical cost ‎accounting and which may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance. FFO should not be viewed as an alternative to, in isolation from, or superior to, net income or cash flow from operations, or results from Parkit's comprehensive operations, respectively, or other measures calculated in accordance with IFRS. FFO should not be interpreted as an indicator of cash generated from operating activities and is not indicative of cash available to fund operating expenditures, or for the payment of cash distributions. FFO is simply an additional measure of operating performance which highlight trends in Parkit's core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Parkit's management also uses this Non-IFRS Measure in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period and to prepare operating budgets. In addition, while Parkit's methods of calculating FFO comply with REALPAC recommendations, FFO may differ from and not be comparable to FFO used by other companies. The following table indicates how Parkit reconciles FFO to the nearest IFRS measure.Three months ended December 31, 2023Three months ended December 31, 2022Twelve months ended December 31, 2023Twelve months ended December 31, 2022 Net Loss and comprehensive loss$(4,243,583)$(2,552,258)$(5,092,053)$(3,479,408)Add / (Deduct): Share of (gain) loss from equity-accounted investees1,173,548205,553(795,447)(198,775)Depreciation2,116,5241,847,0827,708,7274,587,842Unrealized loss on derivative financial instruments1,965,707-1,965,707-Foreign exchange(77,633)36,121(126,904)(78,309)Income tax (recovery) expense(336)(80,644)-(80,325)Share based compensation455,9361,196,153455,9361,196,153 FFO$1,390,163$652,007$4,115,966$1,947,178 FFO per share$0.01$0.00$0.02$0.01 About Parkit Enterprise Inc.

The company achieved record annual revenue, gross profit, and cash flows from operations in 2023, showing strong financial growth. Additionally, Vox entered into a credit agreement with the Bank of Montreal for a $15 million secured revolving credit facility. The company's fourth quarter results also displayed revenue and profit growth, along with record cash flows from operations. Despite challenges with certain mining projects in Peru, Vox remains optimistic about its future performance and shareholder value. Positive Record annual revenue of $12,310,594 in 2023, up ~45% from 2022. Record annual gross profit of $9,978,660 in 2023, up ~50% from 2022. Record annual cash flows from operations of $5,271,090 in 2023, up ~157% from 2022. Q4 2023 revenue of $2,997,426, up ~42% from Q4 2022. Q4 2023 gross profit of $2,072,497, up ~30% from Q4 2022. Generated record cash flows from operations of $2,341,781 in Q4 2023, up ~38% from Q4 2022. Entered into a credit agreement with the Bank of Montreal for a $15 million secured revolving credit facility. Increased quarterly dividend by 9.1% to $0.012 per common share. Outlook for 2024 estimates royalty revenue to total $11 million to $13 million. Negative Impairment charge of $1,087,206 for four royalties due to mining claim issues in Peru. Legal actions against the operator of exploration projects in Peru. Net loss of $417,962 in Q4 2023. Reduced carrying value of investment from $1,000,000 to $nil due to impairments. Financial Analyst The report from Vox Royalty Corp. indicates significant financial growth, with record annual revenue, gross profit and cash flows from operations. The increase in quarterly dividend by 9.1% reflects a strong cash flow position, which could signal confidence from management in the company's financial stability and future earnings potential. The entry into a credit facility with the Bank of Montreal, particularly the accordion feature, suggests strategic financial planning to support further expansion or to provide a buffer against market volatility.Investors should note the robust revenue growth of approximately 45% year-over-year, surpassing the midpoint of the 2023 revenue guidance. This performance, combined with the substantial increase in cash flows from operations, may indicate operational efficiency and effective cost management. However, the projected royalty revenue for 2024 remaining consistent with 2023 figures could imply a plateau in growth or conservative estimates by management. Legal Expert The impairment of the four Peruvian mining concessions due to non-renewal by the operator is a critical legal event. The company's decision to file a statement of claim for replacement royalties, as per the original agreement, underscores the importance of contractual safeguards in royalty agreements. The potential to reverse up to $1,000,000 of the impairment charge is contingent on the legal outcome and could materially affect the company's financials. Stakeholders should closely monitor this situation, as it could influence the company's asset valuation and future revenue streams. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Vox Royalty Corp.'s performance in the mining royalty sector is noteworthy. The sector often serves as a leveraged play on the underlying commodity prices and Vox's revenue guidance suggests a cautious but potentially realistic approach given the unpredictable nature of commodity markets. The company's strategic milestones, including accretive royalty acquisitions and IP licensing agreements, demonstrate a diversified approach to growth. These strategic initiatives could mitigate risks associated with individual mining projects and provide a more stable royalty income stream.Furthermore, the graduation to the TSX and the dividend increase could attract institutional investors seeking companies with a track record of growth and shareholder returns. However, investors should consider the inherent risks of the mining sector, including regulatory changes, operational challenges and fluctuating commodity prices, which could impact Vox's performance. 03/07/2024 - 06:00 PM INCREASES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND AND PROVIDES 2024 OUTLOOKTORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / March 7, 2024 / Vox Royalty Corp.

As a result, the Company fully impaired the four royalties as of December 31, 2023, and the carrying value of the investment of $1,000,000 has been reduced to $nil. The Company has filed a statement of claim in the Supreme Court of Western Australia against the operator of the Jaw, Phoebe, Cart and Colossus exploration projects. Pursuant to the original agreement signed with the operator on July 15, 2021, if any of the four exploration projects became relinquished within three years of signing the original agreement, the operator must promptly provide Vox with a replacement royalty for each relinquished royalty and with each replacement royalty having a value of at least $250,000. To the extent Vox is granted one or more replacement royalties, the Company expects to reverse up to $1,000,000 of the Q4 2023 impairment charge, which would increase net income by the equivalent amount.For complete details, please refer to the consolidated financial statements and associated Management Discussion and Analysis for the years ended December 31, 2023, available on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca), EDGAR (www.sec.gov) or on Vox's website (www.voxroyalty.com).Quarterly Dividend IncreaseThe Company is also pleased to announce that its Board of Directors has raised its quarterly dividend and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.012 per common share, to be paid on April 12, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 29, 2024. This is a 9.1% increase from the previous $0.011 per common share quarterly dividend and marks the second consecutive annual increase for Vox shareholders.For shareholders residing in Canada, the dividend will be paid in Canadian dollars based on the daily exchange rate published by the Bank of Canada on March 28, 2024. The dividend qualifies as an ""eligible dividend"" as defined in the Income Tax Act (Canada). The dividend is subject to customary Canadian withholding tax for shareholders that are not resident in Canada.OutlookThe operational performance of the Company's portfolio during 2023 was generally in line with our expectations. On April 27, 2023, Vox estimated that 2023 royalty revenue guidance would be in the range of $11 million to $13 million. For the year ended December 31, 2023, Vox's royalty revenue exceeded the midpoint of the range, totalling $12,310,594.For 2024, Vox estimates royalty revenue to total $11 million to $13 million. Our 2024 outlook on royalty revenue is based on publicly available information of the owners or operators of projects on which we have a royalty interest and which we believe to be reliable. When publicly available forecasts on properties are not available, we obtain internal forecasts from the owners or operators, if available, or use our own management estimation.About VoxVox is a returns focused mining royalty company with a portfolio of over 60 royalties spanning seven jurisdictions.

(TSX: DXT)HighlightsThe Corporation generated strong results for the 2023 year with consolidated revenue of $1.1 billion, an increase of 15.0% or $145.7 million compared to $971.5 million in the prior year. The increase in revenue was due to continued growth in IFM and WAFES including the positive impact of the unprecedented wildfire activity in 2023. The Corporation generated consolidated revenue of $270.5 million for Q4 2023 which increased $16.6 million, or 6.6%, compared to Q4 2022. This was mainly driven by the mobilization of new wins in IFM, and robust workforce accommodations activity in WAFES despite the normal holiday season slowdown period. These increases were partially offset by lower modular revenue related to delays in completing certain social affordable housing projects due to manufacturing quality, subcontractor challenges and remediation work;Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 was $100.6 million which is a record for the Corporation and an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $35.9 million or 55% compared to the prior year. This was driven primarily by higher business activity in WAFES as well as significantly improved profitability in IFM due to new sales growth and operational improvements. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2023 was $12.6 million and $14.0 million in Q4 2022. Increased profitability in the WAFES and IFM business units for Q4 2023 as compared to Q4 2022 was offset by an EBITDA loss of $10.9 million in the Modular business including a provision of $5.7 million to cover 2024 rework and remediation related to manufacturing quality and third-party design and subcontractor issues;The Board and Management recently completed a strategic review of the Modular business and are currently in discussions with a potential buyer for the sale of the business unit. We believe our decision to pursue a sale of the Modular business will be a positive for our Modular employees, customers and shareholders and will allow the Corporation to simplify its business and deploy capital in areas of the business with stronger returns;Consolidated net earnings were $26.8 million for 2023 compared to $3.7 million in 2022 and included non-recurring items of $6.5 million (2022 - $12.1 million). Earnings per diluted share were 41 cents per share in 2023 compared to 5 cents per diluted share in 2022. Consolidated net loss was $0.3 million for Q4 2023 compared to a net loss of $2.9 million in Q4 2022 and included project rework and remediation costs in Modular of approximately $9 million;Free Cash Flow (""FCF"") was $53.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $40.3 million in 2022. The Adjusted EBITDA conversion to FCF for 2023 met expectations at 52.7% as compared to 62.2% in the prior year. FCF is expected to be approximately 50% of Adjusted EBITDA in 2024;In connection to the ongoing Normal Course Issuer Bid (""NCIB""), Dexterra repurchased 855,100 common shares in 2023 at a weighted average price per share of $5.73 for a total cash cost of $4.9 million;Dexterra declared a dividend for Q1 2024 of $0.0875 per share for shareholders of record at March 29, 2024, to be paid April 15, 2024; andOn February 29, 2024, the Corporation acquired CMI Management, LLC (""CMI""), an IFM business based in Alexandria, Virginia serving federal government agencies and commercial clients across the United States (""US"").

The increase is primarily attributable to new sales growth in post-secondary education food services as well as the Hotel, Rail and Leisure division continued to show strong growth.Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $19.0 million, which increased by $5.4 million or 40.2% compared to $13.6 million in 2022. The increased profitability was driven by new sales, contract pricing adjustments to the existing portfolio and a continued focus on execution and cost management. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 5.7% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 4.9% in the prior year.For Q4 2023, IFM revenues were $89.3 million, an increase of $10.8 million, or 13.7%, from Q4 2022 and $9.7 million or 12.2% higher than Q3 2023. The revenue growth reflects the mobilization of new contract wins. IFM Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $4.8 million compared to $2.8 million for Q4 2022 and $4.5 million for Q3 2023. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 5.3% in Q4 2023 compared to 3.5% in Q4 2022 and was impacted by lower margins on the onboarding of contracts. Certain contracts continue to be impacted by higher labour costs as a result of inflation which we expect to recover over time, through pricing adjustments and operational improvements.Workforce Accommodations, Forestry and Energy Services (""WAFES"")Revenue from WAFES for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $595.4 million which is an increase of $105.4 million or 21.5% compared to 2022. The increase was due to strong activity in workforce accommodations, price adjustments on client contracts to combat inflationary pressures, strong access matting sales and rentals, and high revenue from fire support services as a result of the unprecedented wildfire season nationwide. Adjusted EBITDA was $106.1 million and 42.3% higher compared to the prior year due to the factors noted above. For the year ended December 31, 2023, fire support services generated revenue of $55.6 million (2022 - $9.1 million).Adjusted EBITDA as percentage of revenue was 17.8%, which is higher compared to the 15.2% in 2022 primarily due to higher occupancy for multiple large camps, successful price negotiations with clients, strong Energy Services margins and higher fire support services.Revenue from the WAFES business for Q4 2023 was $141.9 million, an increase of $18.7 million or 15.2% compared to Q4 2022. WAFES revenue growth was stronger in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022 due to continued high occupancy at turn-key and open lodges and strength in the access matting business. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2023 increased to $23.0 million compared to $21.4 million for the same quarter last year (Q3 2023 - $39.5 million). Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue of 16.2% is largely consistent with the 17.4% in Q4 2022, excluding one-time retroactive price increases in Q4 2022.Modular SolutionsRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $189.4 million, a decrease of $10.2 million or 5.1% compared to 2022 due to reduced backlog including delays in approvals for social affordable housing projects. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023 was a loss of $6.1 million, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $8.3 million in the prior year. Factors impacting 2023 results include rework and remediation on social affordable housing projects of $15.0 million, due to third-party design, manufacturing quality and subcontractor errors as well as a subcontractor insolvency. This includes an additional $1.6 million of additional costs related to certain fixed price BC housing projects impacted by delays (in excess of the provision taken in Q4 2022). The education portables and commercial/industrial modulars business continues to deliver positive growth and solid profitability.Modular Solutions revenues for Q4 2023 were $39.3 million compared to $52.2 million in Q4 2022. The Adjusted EBITDA loss of $10.9 million was due to the project rework required on the projects mentioned above. A provision of $5.7 million was recorded in Q4 related to the estimated 2024 costs to complete the remediation work. Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 2022 included a provision of $6.0 million, to cover the cost impact and future losses on social affordable housing projects still under construction. Plant staffing reductions were undertaken in Q4 2023 to help mitigate the temporary softness in the social affordable housing backlog.Other non-recurring itemsFor the year ended December 31, 2023, non-recurring items recorded in Corporate direct costs include an onerous contract loss provision of $1.6 million as the IFM portfolio was right sized and restructuring costs of $0.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Corporate had direct costs of $12.2 million which included $6.9 million related to contractual disputes and remediation work related to contracts in place at the time of the Acquisition of Horizon North Logistics Inc. in May 2020 as well as $2.9 million related to an onerous IFM contract to record future losses over the life of the contract, $2.0 million related to the restructuring and systems implementation for a business unit being integrated with VCI and $0.5 million in other items. Non-recurring items included in Corporate direct costs for Q4 2023 include a $0.7 million recovery on the losses for an onerous IFM contract due to a customer settlement. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Corporation also entered into an agreement to sell excess camp assets and recorded a related impairment on these assets of $2.2 million in Q3. The sale is expected to close in the first half of 2024. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesEffective August 15, 2023 the Corporation reached an agreement with its lenders to amend its credit facility and extend the maturity date to September 7, 2026. The amended credit facility has an available limit of $260 million plus an uncommitted accordion of $150 million. See Note 11 of the Financial Statements for more details. Debt was $89.6 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $133.9 million at September 30, 2023. The decrease in debt from Q3 2023 was expected as our accounts receivable were converted into cash as the business moved out of its normal seasonal peak activity period in Q3 2023. Adjusted EBITDA conversion to FCF met expectations at 52.7% for the 2023 year as compared to 62.2% in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA conversion to FCF in 2024 is expected to be approximately 50.0%, with Q3 and Q4 experiencing the highest conversions to FCF as a result of the seasonality of the WAFES and IFM business units.Additional Information A copy of Dexterra's Consolidated Financial Statements (""Financial Statements"") for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and related Management's Discussion and Analysis (""MD&A"") have been filed with the Canadian Securities Regulatory authorities and are available on SEDAR at sedarplus.ca and Dexterra's website at dexterra.com.

Stockholders as of March 18, 2024, will receive two additional shares for each share held. Trading on a split-adjusted basis will commence on March 27, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of a three-for-one stock split by Texas Pacific Land Corporation is a strategic move that could have several implications for the company's stock liquidity and market perception. Stock splits are often employed to make shares more affordable to a broader range of investors, potentially increasing the stock's liquidity. This can lead to a more active trading environment and possibly a broader shareholder base.From a valuation standpoint, a stock split in itself does not change the intrinsic value of the company, as the market capitalization remains constant. However, it can sometimes be perceived positively by the market if the split is viewed as a signal of management's confidence in the company's future performance. It's also worth noting that post-split, the company will have a higher number of shares outstanding, which will affect the earnings per share (EPS) metric, although this is purely a mathematical adjustment. Market Research Analyst Examining the broader market context, stock splits have historically been associated with high-growth companies that see their share prices increase substantially. For Texas Pacific Land Corporation, this move may reflect a period of growth and optimism about future prospects. It's important to analyze the company's sector performance and compare it to its peers to assess whether the stock split aligns with industry trends.Market participants should also consider the timing of the stock split. The fact that the company has chosen to announce the split could suggest strategic planning in relation to market cycles and investor sentiment. An increase in the number of retail investors participating in the market might have also influenced the decision, as stock splits can make shares more accessible to this investor class. 03/07/2024 - 06:08 PM DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE: TPL) (the “Company”) today announced that its Board of Directors has approved a three-for-one stock split to be distributed to stockholders as a stock dividend.

Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a cash dividend by The First of Long Island Corporation (FLIC) signifies the company's current financial health and stability, which is a positive signal to investors. A dividend payout can often be interpreted as a sign that the company has sufficient earnings and cash flow to share profits with shareholders. The specified amount of $.21 per share provides a tangible return on investment, which is an important consideration for income-focused investors.When analyzing the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the price per share, it's essential to compare it to the industry average to assess the attractiveness of the dividend. Investors should also consider the company's dividend payout ratio, which is the percentage of earnings paid to shareholders in dividends. A sustainable payout ratio typically ranges from 35% to 55% for healthy companies, though this can vary by industry.Furthermore, the consistency and potential growth of dividends are critical. A company that steadily increases its dividends may be seen as more reliable and potentially more valuable in the long term. Investors should also be aware of the ex-dividend date, which is one business day before the record date, as shares bought on or after this date will not qualify for the declared dividend.

These factors can contribute to the company's competitive positioning and financial performance, which in turn can affect investor sentiment and stock valuation. 03/07/2024 - 05:45 PM MELVILLE, N.Y., March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The First of Long Island Corporation (Nasdaq: FLIC) announced today the declaration of a first quarter cash dividend in the amount of $.21 per share.

Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Century Communities, Inc.'s expansion into the Coolidge area with the Cross Creek Ranch development is a strategic move that leverages the growing demand for affordable housing. The mid $200s price point for single-family homes is competitive, particularly given the current economic climate where affordability is a key concern for many consumers. The choice of location is also notable, as Coolidge is positioned for growth, benefiting from its proximity to Phoenix while offering a small-town atmosphere.The inclusion of shared amenities like playgrounds and basketball courts aligns with modern homebuyer preferences, who often seek community features that enhance their living experience. By offering a variety of floor plans and online purchasing options, Century Communities caters to the increasing trend of digital home shopping, which has been accelerated by the pandemic. This approach not only broadens their market reach but also modernizes the home-buying process, potentially leading to increased sales velocity. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Century Communities' initiative to sell new homes online could have positive implications for their revenue stream and market share. The focus on affordable pricing could attract a larger customer base, particularly first-time homebuyers and those looking for cost-effective living solutions near urban areas. By diversifying their portfolio with developments like Cross Creek Ranch, the company is likely aiming to mitigate market risks associated with economic downturns and fluctuating real estate markets.However, it's important to monitor the cost structure and profit margins associated with this venture, as the affordability aspect might lead to lower margins compared to luxury developments. Investors should consider the balance between volume sales and profit per unit when evaluating the company's financial health and future growth prospects. Real Estate Development Expert The real estate development aspect of Cross Creek Ranch highlights several industry-specific considerations. For instance, the development's emphasis on single-story floor plans suggests a response to demographic trends, such as the aging population's preference for homes without stairs. The project's scale, with 227 homesites, indicates a significant investment in the Coolidge area, which could drive local economic growth and create a ripple effect in the regional housing market.Furthermore, the development's success hinges on effective project management, including timely construction, quality control and adherence to regulatory requirements. The balance between speed of development and maintaining high standards of construction will be critical in ensuring the long-term reputation and success of Century Communities in the region. 03/07/2024 - 05:47 PM National leader in online homebuying now selling affordable, quality new build homes outside of Phoenix COOLIDGE, Ariz., March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Century Communities, Inc.,—a top 10 national homebuilder, an industry leader in online home sales, and the highest-ranked homebuilder on Newsweek's list of America's Most Trustworthy Companies 2023—announced that its Century Complete brand is now selling a lineup of single-family homes at Cross Creek Ranch, a new Coolidge community.

Financial Analyst The filing of an Annual Report Form 10-K by Natural Resource Partners L.P. is a significant event for investors and market analysts as it provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial health and operational performance over the past year. Reviewing the financial statements within the 10-K, such as the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement, is crucial for assessing the company's profitability, liquidity and solvency.Given NRP's diversified portfolio, which includes coal, industrial minerals and renewable energy activities, the report can shed light on the performance of different segments and how they contribute to the overall revenue. This is particularly relevant in the context of the energy transition, as the demand for coal is expected to decline while interest in renewable energy sources rises. Investors would be keen to understand how NRP is navigating this shift and any strategic adjustments being made.Furthermore, NRP's equity investment in Sisecam Wyoming LLC, a leading soda ash producer, adds another layer to the analysis. Soda ash is used in various industries, including glass manufacturing and its market dynamics can influence NRP's financial outcomes. The performance of this investment could provide insights into the global industrial demand and potential future revenue streams for NRP. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the trends within the natural resources sector is essential for understanding NRP's market position and potential growth opportunities. The Annual Report can provide information on the company's leasing activities, property management and the impact of regulatory changes on operations, particularly in the context of carbon sequestration and renewable energy activities.With the increasing focus on environmental sustainability and carbon footprint reduction, NRP's ability to adapt and potentially benefit from carbon sequestration initiatives could be a significant driver of future growth. This is an area of interest for investors who are looking to align their portfolios with environmentally responsible companies. Additionally, the performance of the renewable energy segment could be indicative of the company's long-term viability in a rapidly changing energy market.Understanding the competitive landscape, including the performance of peers and the overall demand for industrial minerals, will also be crucial. Any commentary on market conditions, supply constraints, or pricing pressures within the 10-K report can provide valuable context for market expectations and company strategy moving forward. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the filing of the Annual Report Form 10-K is a regulatory requirement that ensures transparency and compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It offers a detailed account of any legal proceedings, regulatory compliance issues and potential risks associated with NRP's operations.Investors and stakeholders are particularly attentive to disclosures regarding environmental regulations, given the nature of NRP's business in natural resources. Any changes in environmental laws, penalties, or new compliance measures can have a direct impact on operational costs and profitability. The legal section of the 10-K report will also highlight the company's approach to managing these risks, which is critical for evaluating the long-term sustainability of the business.Additionally, the report may contain information on intellectual property rights, patents, or licenses that are vital for NRP's carbon sequestration and renewable energy activities. These legal aspects can affect the company's competitive edge and its ability to capitalize on new market opportunities. 03/07/2024 - 05:45 PM HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Natural Resource Partners L.P.

(URI) announces a $1.1 billion offering of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2034 to finance the acquisition of Yak Access, LLC. The Notes are guaranteed by URI and certain subsidiaries, with expected net proceeds of $1.090 billion. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The pricing of a $1.1 billion senior notes offering by United Rentals (North America), Inc. is a significant financial event, indicating a strategic move to raise capital for acquisitions and other corporate purposes. The use of the proceeds to finance the acquisition of Yak Access, LLC suggests a targeted growth strategy, which could potentially expand United Rentals' service offerings and market presence.The 6.125% interest rate on the notes, due in 2034, reflects the current interest rate environment and the company's creditworthiness. Investors should compare this rate with those of other corporate bonds and the broader market to assess the investment's attractiveness. The senior unsecured guarantee by United Rentals, Inc. and its domestic subsidiaries provides an additional layer of security for investors, which is reflected in the bond's pricing.The use of an asset-based revolving credit facility in conjunction with the note offering is a common financial strategy that provides flexibility in terms of liquidity management. However, it is important to monitor the company's leverage and interest coverage ratios post-acquisition to assess the impact on its financial health. Legal Expert The offering's structure, utilizing Rule 144A and Regulation S, allows United Rentals to access capital from qualified institutional buyers and certain international investors without the broader requirements of a public offering. This approach often expedites the capital-raising process but limits the potential investor base to those who meet specific criteria.It is crucial for potential investors to understand that the senior notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and are therefore subject to restrictions on their transferability. This lack of registration necessitates a reliance on exemptions for the sale and purchase of these securities, which can affect their liquidity and marketability.The cautionary note that the offering may not be consummated on its proposed terms or at all is a standard disclaimer, but it also underscores the inherent uncertainty in such financial transactions. This uncertainty can influence investor sentiment and market dynamics surrounding the company's securities. Market Research Analyst The decision by United Rentals to acquire Yak Access, LLC is indicative of strategic moves within the equipment rental industry to consolidate and diversify services. The market impact of such acquisitions can be significant, potentially altering competitive dynamics and customer offerings. It is essential to evaluate the strategic fit of Yak Access within United Rentals' portfolio and the potential for synergies that could drive revenue growth and operational efficiencies.Market response to the senior notes offering will also provide insight into investor confidence in United Rentals' growth strategy and financial stability. The credit market's reception of the notes, particularly in terms of demand and yield spread over comparable securities, will be a telling indicator of the market's view on the company's future prospects and risk profile. 03/07/2024 - 05:36 PM STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE: URI) (“URI”) today announced that its subsidiary, United Rentals (North America), Inc. (“URNA”), has priced an offering of $1.1 billion principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2034 (the “Notes”) in a private offering. URNA’s obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by URI and certain of URNA’s domestic subsidiaries. Aggregate net proceeds from the sale of the Notes are expected to be approximately $1.090 billion after initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and payments of estimated fees and expenses. URNA expects to use the net proceeds from its offering of the Notes, together with borrowings under URNA’s senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, to finance the acquisition of Yak Access, LLC (“Yak”) and to pay related fees and expenses. URNA is offering the Notes (and the related guarantees) pursuant to an exemption under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The initial purchasers of the Notes will offer the Notes only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act or outside the United States to certain persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or under any state securities laws. Therefore, the Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States to, or for the account or benefit of, any United States person unless the offer or sale would qualify for a registration exemption from the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. This news release is not intended to be a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of any of the securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.

The company saw an 18% increase in Stinger™ Dissolvable units sold year-over-year and a 16% increase in international revenue. Despite market volatility, Nine focused on de-levering and introducing new completion tools. Positive None. Negative - Net loss of $(32.2) million for the full year 2023. - ROIC of (10.8)% for the full year 2023. - G&A expense of $59.8 million for the full year 2023. - Depreciation and amortization expense of $40.7 million for the full year 2023. - Liquidity position of $58.9 million as of December 31, 2023. Financial Analyst An evaluation of Nine Energy Service's financial results reveals a mixed picture for investors. The reported revenue of $609.5 million for the full year aligns with the industry's expected performance, considering the volatility in oil and gas markets. An 18% increase in Stinger™ Dissolvable units sold indicates successful product penetration despite overall activity declines. However, a net loss of $(32.2) million underscores the challenges faced in a fluctuating price environment. The adjusted EBITDA of $73.0 million, while positive, suggests that operational efficiency is being maintained to some extent. The capital structure changes, including the senior secured notes offering and the extension of the ABL credit facility, suggest a strategic move towards liquidity improvement and debt management.From an investment standpoint, the company's focus on becoming 'asset and labor light' and its service and geographic diversification could be a strategic advantage in a volatile market. However, the flat Q1 revenue projection coupled with a 20% decline in US rig count might temper short-term expectations. Investors should monitor the company's ability to maintain its adjusted EBITDA levels and manage its capital expenditures, which came in below guidance, as indicators of financial discipline and operational efficiency. Market Research Analyst The oil and gas industry is known for its cyclical nature and Nine Energy Service's report reflects this reality. The company's increase in international revenue by approximately 16% year-over-year is a notable achievement, demonstrating successful expansion beyond domestic volatility. This strategic move could potentially buffer the company against regional downturns and provide a more stable revenue stream. Moreover, the introduction of new technologies such as the Pincer Hybrid Frac Plug could position the company for increased market share in the coming year.Investor sentiment in the energy sector often hinges on technological advancements and international market penetration. Nine Energy Service's proactive approach in these areas might be seen as a long-term growth strategy. However, the mention of no catalyst for activity increases in the near-term may lead to cautious investor outlooks in the short-term. Stakeholders should consider the company's ESG initiatives and their potential to attract investment as the industry faces increasing pressure to reduce emissions and adopt sustainable practices. Energy Sector Analyst The reported decline in the US rig count by approximately 20% and the significant drop in natural gas prices by over 60% year-over-year provide context for the operational environment in which Nine Energy Service is operating. These figures are indicative of broader market trends that can impact energy companies' performance. The company's ability to increase sales of Stinger™ Dissolvable units amidst these conditions reflects resilience and adaptability—key attributes for success in the energy sector.Looking ahead, the company's mention of ESG progress, including the quantification of greenhouse gas emissions, is increasingly important as the sector faces regulatory and societal pressures for sustainable operations. Investors are paying closer attention to ESG factors, which can influence company valuations and access to capital. Nine Energy Service's efforts in this area could be seen as aligning with investor expectations and industry trends towards greater transparency and sustainability. 03/07/2024 - 05:15 PM Full year 2023 revenue, net loss and adjusted EBITDAA of $609.5 million, $(32.2) million and $73.0 million, respectively Revenue, net loss and adjusted EBITDA of $144.1 million, $(10.3) million and $14.6 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2023 Increased total number of Stinger™ Dissolvable units sold by approximately 18% year- over-year Increased international revenue by approximately 16% year-over-year HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Nine Energy Service, Inc. (""Nine"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: NINE) reported fourth quarter 2023 revenues of $144.1 million, net loss of $(10.3) million, or $(0.30) per diluted share and $(0.30) per basic share, and adjusted EBITDA of $14.6 million. The Company had provided original fourth quarter 2023 revenue guidance between $137.0 and $147.0 million, with actual results coming within the provided range. “Fourth quarter revenue was in-line with expectations, coming within the upper end of our original guidance,” said Ann Fox, President and Chief Executive Officer, Nine Energy Service. “The oil and gas market continued to be volatile in 2023, with the US rig count declining by approximately 20% since the end of 2022. Many of these rig declines came out of the gassy basins in conjunction with the average natural gas price declining by over 60% year-over-year. 2023 once again illustrated that the market can shift quickly, which is why we have created a nimble business that can flex quickly with market conditions.” “Despite a challenging market backdrop, the Nine team accomplished a lot in 2023, including our 2028 senior secured notes offering, extension of our ABL credit facility and full redemption of our prior senior notes due 2023. This new capital structure gives us additional flexibility and de-levering continues to be a high priority for Nine.” “I am extremely proud of our completion tool offering and what we have been able to accomplish in 2023 with both our existing tools and the introduction of new tools in the domestic and international markets. We have surpassed over 370,000 Scorpion™ Composite Plugs run since we acquired the technology in 2015. Despite activity declines year-over-year, we increased the total number of Stinger™ Dissolvable units sold by approximately 18% and increased our total international revenue by approximately 16% year-over-year. We also introduced new technology with our Pincer Hybrid Frac Plug and look forward to gaining market share with this tool in 2024.” “During 2023, we made significant progress with ESG, quantifying the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions for 2021 and 2022 and we will have 2023 data in 2024. We are identifying gaps and procedures to make the collection of this data more accurate and efficient, as well as developing a strategy on how to potentially reduce our emissions moving forward.” “Turning to Q4, activity levels and pricing were mostly stable versus Q3. We had a significant increase in our international tools sales quarter-over-quarter, which helped drive strong incremental margins.” “The market can change quickly, but I do not foresee any catalyst for activity increases in the near-term. Q1 activity levels and pricing have been mostly flat compared to Q4, in conjunction with the US rig count. Because of this, we expect Q1 revenue to be relatively flat compared with Q4.” “We will continue to focus on our strategy of being an asset and labor light business that couples excellent service and forward-leaning technology to help our customers lower their cost to complete. Our team can navigate sharp market changes and quickly capitalize on improving markets. Our service and geographic diversity provides us balance and we are focused on diversifying more of our top-line revenue streams to completion tools and the international markets.” Operating Results For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company reported revenues of $609.5 million, net loss of $(32.2) million, or $(0.97) per diluted share and $(0.97) per basic share, and adjusted EBITDA of $73.0 million.

We have made no changes to the manner in which these measures are calculated and have only revised the titles of these measures to more clearly identify them as non-GAAP measures. NINE ENERGY SERVICE, INC. RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED GROSS PROFIT (LOSS) (In Thousands) (Unaudited) Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 2023 2022 Calculation of gross profit: Revenues $ 144,073 $ 140,617 $ 609,526 $ 593,382 Cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below) 118,514 117,676 490,750 457,093 Depreciation (related to cost of revenues) 6,513 6,775 27,101 24,909 Amortization of intangibles 2,829 2,895 11,516 13,463 Gross profit $ 16,217 $ 13,271 $ 80,159 $ 97,917 Adjusted gross profit reconciliation: Gross profit $ 16,217 $ 13,271 $ 80,159 $ 97,917 Depreciation (related to cost of revenues) 6,513 6,775 27,101 24,909 Amortization of intangibles 2,829 2,895 11,516 13,463 Adjusted gross profit $ 25,559 $ 22,941 $ 118,776 $ 136,289 AAdjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (which is net income (loss) before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization) further adjusted for (i) goodwill, intangible asset, and/or property and equipment impairment charges, (ii) transaction and integration costs related to acquisitions, (iii) fees and expenses relating to our units offering and other refinancing activities, (iv) loss or gain on revaluation of contingent liabilities, (v) loss or gain on the extinguishment of debt, (vi) loss or gain on the sale of subsidiaries, (vii) restructuring charges, (viii) stock-based compensation and cash award expense, (ix) loss or gain on sale of property and equipment, and (x) other expenses or charges to exclude certain items which we believe are not reflective of ongoing performance of our business, such as legal expenses and settlement costs related to litigation outside the ordinary course of business. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure and helps identify underlying trends in our operations that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of the impairments, acquisitions and dispositions and costs that are not reflective of the ongoing performance of our business. BAdjusted Gross Profit (Loss) is defined as revenues less cost of revenues excluding depreciation and amortization. This measure differs from the GAAP definition of gross profit (loss) because we do not include the impact of depreciation and amortization, which represent non-cash expenses. Our management uses adjusted gross profit (loss) to evaluate operating performance. We prepare adjusted gross profit (loss) to eliminate the impact of depreciation and amortization because we do not consider depreciation and amortization indicative of our core operating performance. CAdjusted Return on Invested Capital (“Adjusted ROIC”) is defined as adjusted after-tax net operating profit (loss), divided by average total capital. We define adjusted after-tax net operating profit (loss), which is a non-GAAP measure, as net income (loss) plus (i) goodwill, intangible asset, and/or property and equipment impairment charges, (ii) transaction and integration costs related to acquisitions, (iii) fees and expenses relating to our units offering and other refinancing activities, (iv) interest expense (income), (v) restructuring charges, (vi) loss (gain) on the sale of subsidiaries, (vii) loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, and (viii) the provision (benefit) for deferred income taxes. We define total capital as book value of equity (deficit) plus the book value of debt less balance sheet cash and cash equivalents. We compute and use the average of the current and prior period-end total capital in determining Adjusted ROIC. Management believes Adjusted ROIC provides useful information because it quantifies how well we generate operating income relative to the capital we have invested in our business and illustrates the profitability of a business or project taking into account the capital invested, and management uses Adjusted ROIC to assist them in capital resource allocation decisions and in evaluating business performance. Previously, in our SEC filings press releases and other investor materials issued prior to December 31, 2023, we referred to (a) Adjusted ROIC as ROIC and (b) adjusted after-tax net operating profit (loss) as after-tax net operating profit (loss). We have made no changes to the manner in which these measures are calculated and have only revised the titles of these measures to more clearly identify them as non-GAAP measures.

(CLF) raises spot market base prices for carbon steel products, setting minimum price at $840 per net ton.","Cleveland-Cliffs Announces Price Increase for Hot Rolled, Cold Rolled and Coated Steel Products Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (CLF) raises spot market base prices for carbon steel products, setting minimum price at $840 per net ton. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement by Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. regarding the increase in spot market base prices for carbon hot rolled, cold rolled and coated steel products is a strategic move that reflects current market conditions. The adjustment to $840 per net ton for hot rolled steel indicates a response to supply and demand dynamics within the steel industry. This decision is likely influenced by factors such as raw material costs, global demand and competitive pricing strategies.From a market research perspective, the increase in base prices could potentially expand Cleveland-Cliffs' profit margins if the demand remains stable or grows. However, it is also necessary to monitor the elasticity of demand for their products, as significant price increases could lead to a reduction in sales volume if customers turn to alternative suppliers or substitute products. The impact on the company's financial performance will largely depend on how this price change is absorbed by the market. Financial Analyst As a financial analyst assessing the implications of Cleveland-Cliffs' price increase, it is important to consider the potential effects on the company's revenue and earnings per share (EPS). If the market accepts the new pricing, the company could see an uptick in its top-line revenue, which might translate into improved EPS and possibly a more favorable stock performance. This could attract investor interest, particularly if the price increase is indicative of a wider industry trend suggesting a bullish outlook for the steel sector.However, investors should also be cautious about the risks associated with such price hikes, including the possibility of losing market share to competitors who may not follow suit with similar increases. Additionally, it is critical to analyze the timing of this announcement in relation to the company's fiscal calendar and any upcoming earnings reports, as it could influence investor expectations and stock volatility. Economist The decision by Cleveland-Cliffs to raise its base prices for steel products can be interpreted through the lens of macroeconomic factors. Price adjustments in commodities like steel often signal changes in the broader economic environment, such as inflationary pressures or shifts in industrial production. An economist would examine the potential influence of these price changes on inflation rates, particularly in sectors reliant on steel as a key input.Moreover, the price increase may reflect the company's anticipation of future economic conditions. If the price hike is preemptive, it could suggest that Cleveland-Cliffs expects robust economic growth and increased construction and manufacturing activity. Conversely, if the increase is a reaction to cost pressures, it might indicate rising expenses in the supply chain, which could have broader implications for the economy, including the risk of cost-push inflation. 03/07/2024 - 05:24 PM CLEVELAND--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE: CLF) today announced that it is increasing current spot market base prices for all carbon hot rolled, cold rolled and coated steel products, effective immediately with all new orders.

The approval is based on positive results from the ROSEWOOD trial, showcasing higher overall response rates. BRUKINSA is the first and only BTK inhibitor to show efficacy in this type of malignancy, with a broad label covering five oncology indications globally. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The accelerated approval of BRUKINSA for relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma represents a significant advancement in oncology therapeutics. The combination of BRUKINSA with obinutuzumab has demonstrated a higher overall response rate compared to obinutuzumab alone, which is a critical factor in determining the efficacy of new treatment regimens. Follicular lymphoma, being a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, has a pattern of relapse after initial treatment, making the development of effective second-line therapies crucial for long-term disease management. The durability of response, especially with a median follow-up of approximately 20 months, indicates sustained patient benefit, which is a key consideration for clinicians when selecting therapies. Medical Research Analyst From a research and development perspective, the FDA's Fast Track and Orphan Drug Designations for BRUKINSA underscore the unmet medical need in this patient population. The Fast Track Designation facilitates the expedited review of drugs that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need, potentially accelerating the availability of new treatment options. The Orphan Drug Designation provides incentives for companies to develop products for rare diseases, affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. These designations, combined with the accelerated approval based on surrogate endpoints such as response rate, enable quicker patient access to promising therapies while confirmatory trials are conducted to verify clinical benefit. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the approval of BRUKINSA across multiple oncology indications broadens its therapeutic reach and could potentially increase its market share in the BTK inhibitor space. The drug's differentiated clinical profile and the head-to-head trial demonstrating progression-free survival (PFS) superiority over ibrutinib in chronic lymphocytic leukemia may position it favorably among healthcare providers and patients. This is particularly relevant given the competitive nature of the oncology market, where efficacy, safety and long-term outcomes are key drivers of adoption. Additionally, the global expansion of BRUKINSA's indications and its approval in 70 markets indicate a strategic move to capitalize on international growth opportunities, which can be significant for the company's revenue and market valuation. 03/07/2024 - 05:19 PM BRUKINSA is the first and only BTK inhibitor approved across five oncology indications and the first and only approved in follicular lymphoma Approval based on positive results from ROSEWOOD trial showing BRUKINSA plus obinutuzumab achieved higher overall response rate versus obinutuzumab alone BASEL, Switzerland & BEIJING & CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BeiGene, Ltd. (Nasdaq: BGNE; HKEX: 06160; SSE: 688235), a global oncology company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted accelerated approval to BRUKINSA® (zanubrutinib) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL), in combination with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody obinutuzumab, after two or more lines of systemic therapy. The indication is approved under accelerated approval based on response rate and durability of response, marking BRUKINSA’s fifth indication in B-cell malignancies in the U.S. “This accelerated approval of BRUKINSA represents an important advancement, offering the first and only BTK inhibitor treatment for follicular lymphoma patients in the U.S. who have either not responded to initial therapies or have experienced relapse,” said Mehrdad Mobasher, M.D., M.P.H., Chief Medical Officer, Hematology at BeiGene. “BRUKINSA is the only BTK inhibitor to date that shows efficacy with this type of malignancy and now has the broadest label, including five oncology indications, of any medication in its class globally. This is a testament to BRUKINSA’s differentiated clinical profile and our continued commitment to bringing this much-needed treatment option to patients around the world.” BRUKINSA was approved for the treatment of R/R FL under the FDA’s accelerated approval program based on the overall response rate (ORR) from the ROSEWOOD trial (NCT03332017), as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory MAHOGANY (NCT05100862) trial, which is underway. The application for R/R FL was also granted Fast Track Designation and Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA. The ROSEWOOD trial is a global, randomized, open-label Phase 2 study of BRUKINSA plus obinutuzumab compared with obinutuzumab alone in 217 patients with R/R FL who received at least two prior lines of systemic therapy. In the study, the ORR by IRC was 69% in the BRUKINSA plus obinutuzumab arm versus 46% in the obinutuzumab arm (P=0.0012), with a median follow-up of approximately 20 months. Responses were durable, with an 18-month landmark duration of response (DOR) of 69% in the BRUKINSA combination arm.i BRUKINSA plus obinutuzumab was generally well-tolerated, with safety results consistent with previous studies of both medicines.i Serious adverse reactions occurred in 35% of patients who received BRUKINSA in combination with obinutuzumab. Adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of BRUKINSA in 17% of patients. Christopher Flowers, M.D., Division Head of Cancer Medicine and Chair of the Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center commented, “Patients living with follicular lymphoma often experience relapse or do not respond to treatment and need options for treatment during the course of their illness. The findings from the ROSEWOOD trial highlight the significant clinical advantage of treating patients who experience relapse or have refractory follicular lymphoma with zanubrutinib plus obinutuzumab.” “Follicular lymphoma can significantly impact patients' lives and prove to be challenging, especially for those whose condition has advanced despite undergoing prior treatment or experienced relapse,” said the Follicular Lymphoma Foundation. “However, the emergence of new treatment options which have been shown to be effective and well-tolerated, including second generation BTK inhibitors such as zanubrutinib in combination with existing therapies, brings hope to those dealing with advanced follicular lymphoma.” In addition to R/R FL, BRUKINSA is also approved in the U.S. as a treatment for adult patients with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia; mantle cell lymphoma, who have received at least one prior therapy, R/R marginal zone lymphoma, who have received at least one anti-CD20-based regimen; and most recently chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. BRUKINSA is the first and only BTK inhibitor to demonstrate PFS superiority in a head-to-head clinical trial versus ibrutinib in patients with R/R CLL in the global Phase 3 ALPINE trial. In a recent presentation, BRUKINSA showed sustained PFS benefit versus ibrutinib in a longer term follow up. Durable PFS was observed across major subgroups, including in the high-risk 17p deletion/TP53 mutated patient population. BRUKINSA is approved in 70 markets, including the U.S., EU, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, China, South Korea and Switzerland in selected indications, and it is under development for additional indications globally. The global BRUKINSA development program includes more than 5,000 subjects enrolled to date in 29 countries and regions. About Follicular Lymphoma Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), accounting for 22% of all NHL cases.ii Approximately 15,000 cases are diagnosed in the U.S. each year.iii While FL remains incurable, people with the condition can live a long time. The five-year survival rate is about 90%, and approximately half of people diagnosed with FL can live with the disease for nearly 20 years.iv About BRUKINSA® (zanubrutinib) BRUKINSA is a small molecule inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) designed to deliver complete and sustained inhibition of the BTK protein by optimizing bioavailability, half-life, and selectivity. With differentiated pharmacokinetics compared with other approved BTK inhibitors, BRUKINSA has been demonstrated to inhibit the proliferation of malignant B cells within a number of disease-relevant tissues. U.S. Indications and Important Safety Information for BRUKINSA (zanubrutinib) INDICATIONS BRUKINSA is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM). Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy. Relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who have received at least one anti-CD20-based regimen. Relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL), in combination with obinutuzumab, after two or more lines of systemic therapy. The MCL, MZL and FL indications are approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Warnings and Precautions Hemorrhage Fatal and serious hemorrhage has occurred in patients with hematological malignancies treated with BRUKINSA. Grade 3 or higher hemorrhage including intracranial and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hematuria, and hemothorax was reported in 3.8% of patients treated with BRUKINSA in clinical trials, with fatalities occurring in 0.2% of patients. Bleeding of any grade, excluding purpura and petechiae, occurred in 32% of patients. Bleeding has occurred in patients with and without concomitant antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy. Coadministration of BRUKINSA with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications may further increase the risk of hemorrhage. Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding. Discontinue BRUKINSA if intracranial hemorrhage of any grade occurs. Consider the benefit-risk of withholding BRUKINSA for 3-7 days before and after surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding. Infections Fatal and serious infections (including bacterial, viral, or fungal infections) and opportunistic infections have occurred in patients with hematological malignancies treated with BRUKINSA. Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 26% of patients, most commonly pneumonia (7.9%), with fatal infections occurring in 3.2% of patients. Infections due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation have occurred. Consider prophylaxis for herpes simplex virus, pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and other infections according to standard of care in patients who are at increased risk for infections. Monitor and evaluate patients for fever or other signs and symptoms of infection and treat appropriately. Cytopenias Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, including neutropenia (21%), thrombocytopenia (8%) and anemia (8%) based on laboratory measurements, developed in patients treated with BRUKINSA. Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 10% of patients, and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 2.5% of patients. Monitor complete blood counts regularly during treatment and interrupt treatment, reduce the dose, or discontinue treatment as warranted. Treat using growth factor or transfusions, as needed. Second Primary Malignancies Second primary malignancies, including non-skin carcinoma, have occurred in 14% of patients treated with BRUKINSA. The most frequent second primary malignancy was non-melanoma skin cancers (8%), followed by other solid tumors in 7% of the patients (including melanoma in 1% of patients) and hematologic malignancies (0.7%). Advise patients to use sun protection and monitor patients for the development of second primary malignancies. Cardiac Arrhythmias Serious cardiac arrhythmias have occurred in patients treated with BRUKINSA. Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter were reported in 4.4% patients treated with BRUKINSA, including Grade 3 or higher cases in 1.9% of patients. Patients with cardiac risk factors, hypertension, and acute infections may be at increased risk. Grade 3 or higher ventricular arrhythmias were reported in 0.3% of patients. Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., palpitations, dizziness, syncope, dyspnea, chest discomfort), manage appropriately, and consider the risks and benefits of continued BRUKINSA treatment. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animals, BRUKINSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of zanubrutinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused embryo-fetal toxicity, including malformations at exposures that were 5 times higher than those reported in patients at the recommended dose of 160 mg twice daily. Advise women to avoid becoming pregnant while taking BRUKINSA and for 1 week after the last dose. Advise men to avoid fathering a child during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions (≥30%), including laboratory abnormalities, in patients who received BRUKINSA (N=1729) are decreased neutrophil count (51%), decreased platelet count (41%), upper respiratory tract infection (38%), hemorrhage (32%), and musculoskeletal pain (31%). Drug Interactions CYP3A Inhibitors: When BRUKINSA is co-administered with a strong CYP3A inhibitor, reduce BRUKINSA dose to 80 mg once daily. For coadministration with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, reduce BRUKINSA dose to 80 mg twice daily. CYP3A Inducers: Avoid coadministration with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers. Dose adjustment may be recommended with moderate CYP3A inducers.

Meanwhile, cities are overwhelmed and underfunded. The solution is to enable businesses to treat their water right where they use it – which gives them the unique ability to recycle right on the spot.” Eckelberry added, “I first met Kevin as an A-Team expert on his Boom America show.

About OriginClear Once a government monopoly, the business of treating and reusing sewage water is going private. Local industries and communities are now treating-in-place, enabling large-scale recycling while also responding to the challenge of water scarcity and climate change. OriginClear’s approach is dramatically simple: support that new trend and open the door to everyday investors. OriginClear’s Water On Demand subsidiary combines project financing, a veteran engineering company, and downsized “pod” technology, all to serve the new breed of treat-in-place commercial water recycling and treatment systems.

Essex Property Trust Prices $350 Million of Senior Notes,2024-03-07T22:20:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"Essex Property Trust, Inc. (NYSE:ESS) announced a $350 million public offering of 5.500% senior notes due 2034. The Notes were priced at 99.752% of par value with a yield to maturity of 5.532%. Proceeds will repay upcoming debt maturities and fund general corporate purposes.","Essex Property Trust Prices $350 Million of Senior Notes Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Essex Property Trust, Inc. (NYSE:ESS) announced a $350 million public offering of 5.500% senior notes due 2034. The Notes were priced at 99.752% of par value with a yield to maturity of 5.532%. Proceeds will repay upcoming debt maturities and fund general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Essex Property Trust regarding the pricing of their $350 million senior notes due 2034 at a 5.500% interest rate is a significant financial maneuver. From an investment perspective, the yield to maturity of 5.532% is slightly above the coupon rate, indicating a marginally lower price than par value at issuance. This suggests a cautious market reception, potentially due to current interest rate trends or the creditworthiness of the issuer.The decision to use the proceeds to repay upcoming debt, particularly the 3.875% senior unsecured notes due May 2024, is a strategic move to manage the company's debt profile. This refinancing could lead to interest cost savings, given the current low-interest-rate environment relative to historical rates. However, it is crucial to monitor the long-term impact on the company's financial flexibility, especially as the new notes carry a higher interest rate than the maturing debt. Market Research Analyst Essex Property Trust's involvement of multiple reputable financial institutions as joint book-running managers and co-managers reflects the offering's complexity and the need for robust market placement strategies. The offering's timing and conditions could be indicative of the company's market outlook and its strategic response to anticipated economic conditions. As the real estate market is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, the fixed interest payments until 2034 provide investors with clarity on future cash outflows, which is crucial for valuation purposes.Furthermore, the allocation of funds for potential acquisition opportunities signals Essex's growth-oriented strategy. The real estate sector's performance, driven by factors such as housing demand and rent price trends, will be pivotal in determining the success of such investments. Stakeholders should assess the company's acquisition track record and the potential for value creation through these investments. Legal Expert The issuance of senior notes by Essex is subject to regulatory compliance, as indicated by the joint filing of a registration statement with the SEC. Investors must be aware that the offering's closing is contingent upon certain conditions, which, while not specified, typically include legal and regulatory approvals. The detailed prospectus supplement will provide critical legal disclosures, including the notes' covenant structure, guarantees and Essex's obligations.It is also important to consider the legal implications of the 'no offer to sell' statement in jurisdictions where the securities laws are more restrictive. This ensures that Essex and its underwriters mitigate potential legal risks associated with the offering. Investors should review these legal documents to understand fully the terms and risks associated with the notes. 03/07/2024 - 05:20 PM SAN MATEO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Essex Property Trust, Inc.

Reaffirmation of 2024 production, cost, and capital expenditure guidance. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The operating and financial results of Ero Copper Corp. for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 indicate a company in a phase of significant growth and investment. The record production figures, particularly in gold and the completion of key initiatives like the NX60 and the Caraíba mill expansion, suggest that Ero is successfully executing on its growth strategy. The forthcoming Tucumã Project, with over 90% completion, is poised to further enhance the company's production profile and cash flows in the latter half of 2024.From a market perspective, the company's strategic investments and their expected returns are likely to be closely monitored by investors. The successful completion of these projects could potentially lead to increased investor confidence and a positive impact on the company's stock price. However, the full benefits of these investments will hinge on the successful commissioning and operation of the Tucumã Project, as well as the sustained performance of the NX60 and Caraíba Operations. Financial Analyst Financially, Ero Copper's reported net income and adjusted EBITDA for both the quarter and full year show a healthy profitability, which is critical for supporting the company's ongoing and future capital expenditures. The management's decision to strengthen the balance sheet through a bought deal equity financing, resulting in net proceeds of $104.3 million, demonstrates prudence in ensuring financial stability amid an uncertain macroeconomic climate.The provided guidance for 2024, with anticipated decreases in capital expenditures following the completion of the Tucumã Project, suggests an expectation for improved financial efficiency and potentially higher free cash flow in the future. Investors will likely assess the impact of these factors on the company's ability to generate shareholder returns, especially considering the capital-intensive nature of the mining industry. Commodities Analyst The disclosed copper and gold production figures and associated C1 cash costs provide insight into the company's operational efficiency. The reported C1 cash costs for copper and gold are competitive within the industry, with the company benefiting from realized gains on foreign exchange hedges. The increase in gold production, coupled with a decrease in C1 cash costs compared to the previous year, reflects positively on the company's cost management and operational improvements.Looking ahead, the projected commencement of copper concentrate production at the Tucumã Project in H2 2024 could further enhance Ero Copper's position in the market. The provided cost guidance for 2024, particularly the lower projected C1 cash costs for the Tucumã Operations, suggests that the company is aiming for cost efficiencies that could enhance its competitive edge in the commodities market. 03/07/2024 - 05:01 PM (all amounts in US dollars, unless otherwise noted) VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ero Copper Corp.

Please refer to the Company’s discussion of Non-IFRS measures in its Management’s Discussion and Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Measures section at the end of this press release. The Company achieved significant milestones across its organic growth projects Construction of the Tucumã Project progressed significantly, reaching over 90% physical completion as of February 2024. With production of copper concentrate on schedule to commence in H2 2024, the Company's transition from construction to commissioning is underway. The total direct project capital estimate remains unchanged at approximately $310 millionThe Caraíba mill expansion, which is expected to increase mill throughput capacity from 3.2 to 4.2 million tonnes per annum, was completed in December 2023 with design capacity achieved by year-endFollowing the completion of surface infrastructure, the main shaft sinking phase for the Pilar Mine's new external shaft commenced as planned in December 2023. The new external shaft component of the Pilar 3.0 initiative is fully contracted, and projected capital expenditures are within budget During the quarter, amid an uncertain macroeconomic climate, the Company's management team prudently elected to fortify its balance sheet with a bought deal equity financing. Net proceeds from the transaction of $104.3 million contributed to available liquidity at year-end of $261.7 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $111.7 million and $150.0 million of undrawn availability under the Company's senior secured revolving credit facilityThe Company is reaffirming its 2024 production, operating cost, and capital expenditure guidance ""2023 was a cornerstone year in advancing our growth strategy,"" stated David Strang, Chief Executive Officer. ""Our investments over the past few years position us well for the future at both the Xavantina Operations, where we successfully completed the NX60 initiative, and at the Caraíba Operations with the completion of our mill expansion and the excellent progress made on the new external shaft for the Pilar Mine.” ""However, the most significant transformation in our consolidated production profile and cash flows is projected to begin in the second half of this year when production is scheduled to commence at the Tucumã Project. With physical completion at over 90% and capital expenditures on the project starting to wind down, we are approaching an exciting inflection point when we expect to see these investments begin to yield strong shareholder returns."" FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2023 REVIEW Mining & Milling Operations The Caraíba Operations processed 3.2 million tonnes of ore grading 1.49% copper, producing 43,857 tonnes of copper in concentrate for the year after metallurgical recoveries of 91.4% Higher mill throughput volumes and processed copper grades during the fourth quarter resulted in copper production of 11,760 tonnes in concentrate, representing an increase of 9.2% compared to the third quarterFull-year mill throughput volumes increased 12.8%, partially offsetting the impact of a planned decrease in mined and processed copper grades compared to 2022 The Xavantina Operations processed 136,002 tonnes of ore grading 15.13 grams per tonne, producing a record 59,222 ounces of gold in 2023 after metallurgical recoveries of 89.5% Fourth quarter processed gold grades continued to exceed expectations, averaging 17.18 grams per tonne and resulting in production of 16,867 ounces for the quarterThe successful completion of the NX60 initiative contributed to increases in processed gold grades and gold production of 98.8% and 38.8%, respectively, compared to 2022 Organic Growth Projects The Company continued to make significant construction progress at its Tucumã Project, achieving over 90% physical completion as of February 2024. With production of copper concentrate on schedule to commence in H2 2024, the Company's transition from construction to commissioning is underway. Key milestones include: Site fully energized in January 2024 following commissioning of the main substation and completion of the 16-kilometer power line tie-in with the national gridPre-stripping activities continue to track ahead of schedule with approximately 25,000 tonnes of sulphide ore stockpiled for process plant commissioning as at the end of February 2024Mechanical completion and sub-component commissioning (lubrication, hydraulic, electrical, instrumentation and automation systems) continues to progress on scheduleDry commissioning of the crushing circuit, encompassing the primary and secondary crushers as well as screening and conveyance systems, was completed in February 2024, approximately one month ahead of scheduleThe total direct project capital estimate remains approximately $310 millionTo date, the Tucumã Project has recorded no lost-time injuries with over three million hours of work completed since 2022 At the Caraíba Operations, the Company made important advancements on its Pilar 3.0 initiative during the quarter. This initiative aims to transform the Pilar Mine into a two-mine system capable of sustaining annual ore production levels of approximately 3.0 million tonnes The Caraíba mill expansion, which is expected to increase mill throughput capacity from 3.2 to 4.2 million tonnes per annum, was successfully completed in December 2023 with design capacity achieved by year-endFollowing the completion of the head-frame, winders and supporting surface infrastructure, the main shaft sinking phase for the Pilar Mine's new external shaft commenced as planned in December 2023. The new external shaft component of the Pilar 3.0 initiative is fully contracted, and projected capital expenditures are within budget The Xavantina Operations' NX60 initiative was successfully completed in 2023.

Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results, actions, events, conditions, performance or achievements to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause results, actions, events, conditions, performance or achievements to differ from those anticipated, estimated or intended.

Although the Company believes that the assumptions inherent in forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date of this press release, these assumptions are subject to significant business, social, economic, political, regulatory, competitive and other risks and uncertainties, contingencies and other factors that could cause actual actions, events, conditions, results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The Company cautions that the foregoing list of assumptions is not exhaustive. Other events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ materially from those estimated or projected and expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. There can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.

CAUTIONARY NOTES REGARDING MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES Unless otherwise indicated, all reserve and resource estimates included in this press release and the documents incorporated by reference herein have been prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101"") and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the “CIM”) — CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended (the “CIM Standards”). NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. Canadian standards, including NI 43-101, differ significantly from the requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and reserve and resource information included herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by U.S. companies. In particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this press release and the documents incorporated by reference herein use the terms “measured resources,” “indicated resources” and “inferred resources” as defined in accordance with NI 43-101 and the CIM Standards. Further to recent amendments, mineral property disclosure requirements in the United States (the “U.S. Rules”) are governed by subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”) which differ from the CIM Standards. As a foreign private issuer that is eligible to file reports with the SEC pursuant to the multi-jurisdictional disclosure system (the “MJDS”), Ero is not required to provide disclosure on its mineral properties under the U.S. Rules and will continue to provide disclosure under NI 43-101 and the CIM Standards. If Ero ceases to be a foreign private issuer or loses its eligibility to file its annual report on Form 40-F pursuant to the MJDS, then Ero will be subject to the U.S. Rules, which differ from the requirements of NI 43-101 and the CIM Standards. Pursuant to the new U.S. Rules, the SEC recognizes estimates of “measured mineral resources”, “indicated mineral resources” and “inferred mineral resources”. In addition, the definitions of “proven mineral reserves” and “probable mineral reserves” under the U.S. Rules are now “substantially similar” to the corresponding standards under NI 43-101. Mineralization described using these terms has a greater amount of uncertainty as to its existence and feasibility than mineralization that has been characterized as reserves. Accordingly, U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that any measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, or inferred mineral resources that Ero reports are or will be economically or legally mineable. Further, “inferred mineral resources” have a greater amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. Under Canadian securities laws, estimates of “inferred mineral resources” may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. While the above terms under the U.S. Rules are “substantially similar” to the standards under NI 43-101 and CIM Standards, there are differences in the definitions under the U.S. Rules and CIM Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any mineral reserves or mineral resources that Ero may report as “proven mineral reserves”, “probable mineral reserves”, “measured mineral resources”, “indicated mineral resources” and “inferred mineral resources” under NI 43-101 would be the same had Ero prepared the reserve or resource estimates under the standards adopted under the U.S. Rules. What were Ero Copper Corp.'s copper production figures for Q4 and full year 2023? Ero Copper Corp. reported 11,760 tonnes of copper production in Q4 2023 and 43,857 tonnes for the full year.

The company also issues warrants to purchase additional shares at $0.74 per share, with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners as the placement agent. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent capital raise by Momentus Inc. through a registered direct offering is a strategic move that aims to bolster the company's financial position. The transaction involving the sale of over 4.6 million shares at $0.865 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $4 million, indicates an infusion of capital that is likely to be allocated towards the company's growth initiatives or to strengthen its balance sheet.Investors should note the inclusion of warrants with an exercise price of $0.74, which are exercisable immediately. This could potentially dilute existing shareholders but also indicates a vote of confidence from the institutional investor. The capital raise, despite being relatively modest in size, reflects the investor's willingness to bet on the company's future prospects in the burgeoning commercial space industry.Furthermore, the amendment of existing warrants to reduce the exercise price from $0.96 to $0.74, pending stockholder approval, could be indicative of an effort to make these warrants more attractive to potential investors and to align interests with current market conditions. The company's stock performance and the subsequent reaction to this news will be a key indicator of market sentiment towards Momentus Inc.'s strategic moves and future potential. Market Research Analyst Momentus Inc.'s direct offering takes place within the larger context of the commercial space sector, which has been gaining increased attention from investors due to the sector's growth potential and technological advancements. The company's focus on providing in-space infrastructure services positions it in a niche but rapidly evolving market, where the demand for satellite transportation and other space-based services is expected to grow.It is important to analyze the market dynamics, including the competitive landscape and the projected demand for in-space services, to understand the potential impact of this capital raise on Momentus Inc.'s market positioning. The company's ability to capitalize on the proceeds to advance its technological capabilities or expand its service offerings could significantly affect its competitive edge.Moreover, the terms of the offering and the pricing of the warrants relative to the current stock price will be scrutinized by market participants. These terms often reflect the company's negotiation leverage and the investor's risk assessment of the space industry and Momentus Inc.'s specific business model and growth trajectory. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding this transaction, specifically the use of a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, is a common practice for public companies seeking to raise capital efficiently. The ability to act quickly on market opportunities without the need for a new registration statement each time is a significant advantage.The stipulation that the amended warrant exercise price is subject to stockholder approval is also noteworthy. This requirement demonstrates adherence to corporate governance norms and the protection of shareholder interests. The automatic reduction of the exercise price to the Minimum Price, as defined by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d), if stockholder approval is not obtained within a specified timeframe, introduces a fallback mechanism that ensures the transaction aligns with market rules.It is also crucial to highlight that the press release explicitly states that it does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities. This disclaimer is a standard regulatory requirement that prevents any misinterpretation of the communication as an attempt to bypass securities law regulations regarding public offerings. 03/07/2024 - 05:05 PM SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Momentus Inc. (NASDAQ: MNTS) (“Momentus” or the “Company”), a U.S. commercial space company that offers satellite buses, transportation, and other in-space infrastructure services, today announced that it has closed its previously announced registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules with a single institutional investor for the purchase and sale of 4,624,280 shares of common stock (or common stock equivalents in lieu thereof) at a purchase price of $0.865 per share, resulting in total gross proceeds of approximately $4.0 million before deducting placement agent commissions and other estimated offering expenses. The Company further agreed to issue to the investor warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 4,624,280 shares of common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $0.74 per share, are exercisable immediately and expire after five years. A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners acted as the sole placement agent for the offering. This offering is being made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No 333-267230) previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). A final prospectus supplement describing the terms of the proposed offering has been filed with the SEC and is available on the SEC's website located at http://www.sec.gov. Electronic copies of the prospectus supplement may be obtained, when available, from A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners, 590 Madison Avenue, 28th Floor, New York, NY 10022, or by telephone at (212) 624-2060, or by email at prospectus@allianceg.com. The Company also has agreed that certain existing warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,687,000 shares at an exercise price of $0.96 per share have been amended so that the amended warrants will have a reduced exercise price of $0.74 per share. The warrant amendment is subject to stockholder approval, and the warrants shall expire five years from the date stockholder approval is obtained. If stockholder approval is not obtained by the date that is six months following the initial date of issuance of these warrants, then the exercise price of the warrants will automatically be reduced to the Minimum Price (as defined in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d)) of the common stock on the date that is six months following the initial date of issuance of the warrants and the warrants will expire five years following the date that is six months following the initial date of issuance of the warrants. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction. About Momentus Momentus is a U.S. commercial space company that offers commercial satellite buses and in-space infrastructure services including in-space transportation, hosted payloads, and other in-orbit services. Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains certain statements which may constitute “forward-looking statements” for purposes of the federal securities laws.

The company achieved a net income of $63.3 million and a diluted EPS of $12.68, marking a 17% increase from the previous year. However, net sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased by 14% compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to reduced communication product sales. Despite challenges in the market, the company remains optimistic about its international operations. Positive PLPC reported record annual net sales for the fifth consecutive year in 2023. Net income for 2023 was $63.3 million, with a diluted EPS of $12.68, a 17% increase from 2022. Fourth-quarter net sales decreased by 14% from 2022, mainly due to lower communication product sales. The company remains positive about its international operations to offset challenges in the communication product market. Negative Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased by 14% compared to the same period in 2022. Quarterly net income was impacted by decreased gross profit, foreign currency transaction losses, and customer-specific charges. The company faced challenges due to reduced communication product sales and customer destocking efforts. Financial Analyst The reported financial results for Preformed Line Products Company indicate a mixed performance. While annual net sales grew by 5%, there was a noticeable 14% decrease in Q4 net sales year-over-year. Investors should note the company's resilience in maintaining growth in annual net sales for five consecutive years, which reflects a strong market position and effective sales strategies. However, the Q4 decline, driven by reduced communication product sales, suggests potential market saturation or competitive pressures in that segment.From a valuation perspective, the increase in diluted EPS by 17% is a positive sign, indicating improved profitability and earnings quality. The net income growth to $63.3 million, despite the Q4 downturn, shows the company's ability to manage costs and optimize operations over the full year. However, investors should be cautious about the impact of foreign currency translation, which has both positively and negatively affected the company's financials. The outsized foreign currency transaction losses, especially from the devaluation of the Argentine Peso, may be a red flag for potential volatility in future earnings. Market Analyst The dynamics within the communication products market are a crucial factor for stakeholders. The soft market conditions and customer destocking indicate a potential slowdown in the industry, which could have a ripple effect on Preformed Line Products Company's future performance. The company's gross profit margin of 33.0% in Q4 compared to 35.1% for the full year suggests that while they have managed to maintain profitability, there is pressure on margins.Investors should consider the company's strategic response to these challenges. The emphasis on the diversity of international operations as a buffer against the downturn in the U.S. market is significant. It underscores the importance of geographic diversification in mitigating risks associated with regional market fluctuations. The company's ability to navigate these headwinds and maintain a growth trajectory will be critical to its valuation and investor confidence. Economist The reported financials reflect broader economic trends, including inflationary pressures and currency volatility. The company's ability to offset inflationary increases in raw material and freight costs through price increases is commendable and indicates strong pricing power. However, this may not be sustainable if inflation continues to rise or if there is resistance from customers against further price hikes.Additionally, the impact of foreign currency translation on the company's financials highlights the interconnectedness of global markets and the importance of currency risk management. The significant devaluation of the Argentine Peso and its impact on the company's net income underscores the need for robust hedging strategies to protect against such unforeseen events. In the long term, the company's financial health will depend on its ability to adapt to these economic challenges and maintain its competitive edge. 03/07/2024 - 04:30 PM CLEVELAND, March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Preformed Line Products Company (NASDAQ: PLPC) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Full Year 2023 Highlights: Fifth consecutive year of record annual net sales; increased 5% from 2022Record net income of $63.3 millionDiluted EPS of $12.68, an increase of 17% from 2022, a new annual recordNet cash provided by operating activities of $107.7 millionNet sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $145.6 million compared to $169.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, a 14% decrease due primarily to a reduction in communication product sales as the market remains soft and customers destock inventory positions. Foreign currency translation increased fourth quarter 2023 net sales by $2.9 million. Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was $6.3 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, compared to $16.5 million, or $3.28 per diluted share, for the comparable period in 2022. The fourth quarter of 2023 net income was impacted by decreased gross profit from lower net sales, partially offset by selling price increases and a lower effective tax rate for the period. Other discrete factors contributing to the decline in quarterly net income included $2.3 million of outsized foreign currency transaction losses, primarily due to the significant devaluation of the Argentine Peso and customer-specific charges of $3.5 million to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts and the excess and obsolete inventory reserve mainly caused by the downturn in communications end market sales. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 33.0% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Net sales for the full year 2023 were $669.7 million, compared to $637.0 million in 2022. This is the fifth consecutive year of record net sales and represents a 5% increase versus prior year. Foreign currency translation increased full year 2023 net sales by $0.4 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $63.3 million, or $12.68 per diluted share, compared to $54.4 million, or $10.88 per diluted share in 2022. Net income for the full year 2023 was favorably impacted by the increase in margin on incremental sales as well as the full year benefit of price increases which helped offset inflationary increases of raw material and freight costs. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 35.1% for 2023. Rob Ruhlman, Executive Chairman, said, ""Thanks to a strong first half of 2023, we experienced a fifth consecutive year of record annual net sales and fourth consecutive year of earnings per share growth. The second half of the year was impacted by the pullback in spending among communication network operators as well as customer destocking efforts to reduce elevated inventory levels. We expect the significance and diversity of our international operations to help offset some of the pullback in communication product sales largely impacting our USA results. We remain excited about the future prospects for both our communications and energy product end markets and remain well positioned to achieve growth thanks to operational improvements, new product introductions, and production capacity added over the last three years as well as the significant government stimulus programs that are expected to benefit our core markets. Our continued commitment to manufacturing in the USA positions us well for the Build America, Buy America Act (""BABAA"") requirements of the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (""BEAD"") Program, which we expect to drive increased demand for communications products in late 2024/early 2025. We continue to invest capital in our global facilities as necessary and we continue to seek the right opportunities for inorganic growth. We are fully committed to providing our customers with the high-quality products and service they have come to expect from our dedicated workforce.""

The shares were sold at 97% of the average volume-weighted average price on Nasdaq, following an exemption from registration requirements.","NioCorp Completes Issuance and Sale of 82,500 Shares under the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary NioCorp Developments Ltd. issues and sells 82,500 Advance Shares at $2.5472 per share under the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement. The shares were sold at 97% of the average volume-weighted average price on Nasdaq, following an exemption from registration requirements. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The sale of 82,500 common shares by NioCorp Developments Ltd. under the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement is a strategic financing move that has immediate liquidity implications for the company. The pricing of these shares at 97% of the average volume-weighted average price on Nasdaq suggests a discount to the market, which is a common practice in such private placements to incentivize the purchaser. This transaction indicates active capital management and may reflect the company's need for funding to support its operations or growth initiatives.Investors should consider the dilutive effect of such share issuances on existing shareholders. While the capital infusion is beneficial for the company's financial health, it does dilute existing shareholders' equity. The reliance on the exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act indicates that this offering targets specific institutional investors or accredited investors, which is a faster process than a public offering but limits the pool of potential buyers. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding the offering of Advance Shares by NioCorp is critical to understanding its regulatory compliance. The exemption from registration under the Securities Act and the absence of a prospectus filing in Canada, suggests that NioCorp is maneuvering within specific legal boundaries to expedite the share issuance. Investors should note that such transactions are subject to regulatory scrutiny and the company must adhere to stringent conditions to qualify for these exemptions.It is also important to recognize that the Advance Shares cannot be sold in the United States without registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. This legal constraint may impact the liquidity of these shares in the market. Additionally, the company's adherence to the terms of the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement, including the pricing formula, reflects its commitment to contractual obligations and the importance of maintaining investor confidence in its governance practices. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, NioCorp's issuance of Advance Shares under the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement can signal several things to the market. Firstly, it suggests that the company is actively seeking to secure funding, which could be indicative of its current capital needs or future investment plans. Secondly, the market's reaction to such issuances can serve as an indicator of investor confidence in the company's growth prospects and financial stability.Analyzing the volume-weighted average price as the basis for the transaction provides insights into market sentiment and the perceived value of the company's shares. If the market responds favorably to the news of the share issuance, it may be seen as an endorsement of the company's strategy. Conversely, a negative market reaction could reflect concerns over potential over-leverage or the sustainability of the company's growth trajectory. 03/07/2024 - 05:00 PM CENTENNIAL, CO / ACCESSWIRE / March 7, 2024 / NioCorp Developments Ltd.

The company is pleased with drilling results in Chaveroo and SCOOP/STACK, confirming its strategy of low-risk development and targeted acquisitions. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement by Evolution Petroleum Corporation regarding their participation in a fireside chat to discuss capital allocation and development programs is a strategic communication that provides investors with insights into the company's operational and financial strategies. The focus on organic development opportunities and the integration of recent acquisitions like the SCOOP/STACK plays underlines the company's commitment to growth and value creation.From a market perspective, the positive drilling results in the Chaveroo oilfield and the SCOOP/STACK acquisitions signify a potential increase in the company's production capabilities and reserves. This could lead to improved cash flow, which is a critical factor for investors seeking stable dividend-paying stocks. The emphasis on a long-term dividend policy also aligns with the interests of income-focused shareholders.Moreover, the fixed future acreage costs and the systematic participation in future development blocks present a clear roadmap of the company's growth trajectory. This level of transparency and planning is often well-received in the market as it reduces uncertainty and allows for better investment decision-making. Financial Analyst The financial implications of Evolution's recent activities, particularly the integration of the SCOOP/STACK acquisitions, are noteworthy. The reported progress suggests a seamless transition that could lead to a significant uptick in operational efficiency and financial performance in the near term. The expected positive impact on the second half of the company’s third fiscal quarter is a critical point for investors, as it may influence the company's earnings and, consequently, its stock price.Furthermore, the reserves audit scheduled for late April is a pivotal event. The classification of SEC proved undeveloped reserves will provide a clearer picture of the company's assets and potential future production, which is a key determinant of the company's valuation. The completion of 19 of 21 drilled uncompleted wells (DUCs) without incurring additional costs is a strategic financial advantage that enhances the company's investment appeal.Lastly, the consistent performance of the Chaveroo horizontal wells within the budget and their production meeting or exceeding estimates is a testament to the company's operational competency. Such efficiency can lead to cost savings and higher profit margins, which are vital metrics for evaluating a company's financial health. Energy Sector Analyst The details provided on Evolution Petroleum's strategic developments in the Permian Basin and SCOOP/STACK plays offer a comprehensive view of the company's positioning within the energy sector. The Permian Basin and SCOOP/STACK are among the most prolific oil and gas regions in the United States and Evolution's successful drilling and integration in these areas indicate robust growth potential and a competitive edge.The mention of a 10+ year inventory of low-risk development locations is a significant indicator of the company's long-term sustainability in the energy sector. It showcases the company's ability to maintain production levels and reserve replacement, which is crucial for long-term success in an industry characterized by depleting resources.Additionally, the fixed cost per additional net horizontal well provides a cost advantage in a sector where cost control is paramount.

Kelly Loyd, President and Chief Executive Officer, Ryan Stash, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Mark Bunch, Chief Operating Officer, will discuss capital allocation optionality provided by organic development opportunities, the results to date of the Permian horizontal development program in the Chaveroo oilfield in the San Andres formation, the current state of the integration and development activities at its latest SCOOP/STACK acquisitions, and other topics. Registration for the event is available at https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_3i5iPY-PRg6Y8TXkhsC_Sw. Management Comments Kelly Loyd, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, ""We are extremely pleased with the ongoing results of both our recent SCOOP/STACK acquisitions and our first three horizontal development wells in Chaveroo. The drilling results at both Chaveroo and SCOOP/STACK confirm the Company's strategy of combining low-risk development drilling with targeted acquisitions of producing properties and our assessed value of the drilling locations. The combination of our existing producing properties and the now substantial inventory of 10+ years of low-risk development locations are projected to support our dividend policy for many years to come while we continue to consider new acquisition opportunities."" SCOOP/STACK Evolution is pleased to report that the integration of its ~3,700 net acres (average working interest of ~3%) from the Company's three most recent acquisitions in the SCOOP/STACK plays in Oklahoma (collectively, the ""SCOOP/STACK""), which closed on February 12, 2024, is progressing well. The acquisitions' production and cash flow contributions are expected to impact operational and financial results positively and substantially, beginning with the second half of the Company’s third fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2024. The Company expects to complete its reserves audit of the SCOOP/STACK acquisitions in late April, which will include proved developed producing reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. The evaluation of proved undeveloped reserves will focus on identifying which of the estimated 275+ technically proved locations in the SCOOP/STACK will be classified as SEC proved undeveloped reserves as a result of the 5-year development timeline mandated by the SEC. Since November 1, 2023, the effective date of the acquisition, Evolution has participated in the following activities in the SCOOP/STACK: 19 of 21 gross (0.48 of 0.50, net) drilled uncompleted wells (DUCs) have been completed and brought online at the sellers' expense for Evolution's benefit, andAgreed to participate in 15 gross (0.2 net) new horizontal wells across the acreage, 13 of which are currently in progress. Chaveroo All three horizontal wells in the first development block have been completed and are currently producing (Evolution has a 50% working interest). These first three wells, on average, were drilled and completed within 10% of the pre-drill cost estimates. Based on results to date, the wells have met or exceeded the pre-drill production estimates and will substantially contribute to operating and financial results in the fiscal third quarter and beyond. Additionally, Evolution plans to participate for its full 50% working interest in the second development block, which consists of 6 horizontal well locations. The Company fully expects to systematically participate in future development blocks, holding in aggregate over 70 additional horizontal well locations. Future acreage costs are fixed at $36,000 per additional net horizontal well, spaced at approximately 160 gross acres per well.

(CYT) plans to voluntarily delist its common stock from the Nasdaq Global Select Market, notifying Nasdaq of its intent. The company expects to file a Form 25 with the SEC for the delisting process. Positive None. Negative Cyteir Therapeutics, Inc. is planning to delist its common stock voluntarily, which may raise concerns among investors about the company's financial stability and future prospects. Financial Analyst The decision by Cyteir Therapeutics to delist its common stock from the Nasdaq Global Select Market is a significant event that warrants close examination. Delisting, particularly when voluntary, often indicates underlying financial or operational challenges within a company. For stakeholders, this move could suggest a strategic pivot or financial distress, potentially impacting investor confidence and the company's capital raising abilities. The delisting process typically involves a decline in liquidity and marketability of the stock, which can lead to increased volatility and may affect shareholder value negatively in the short term.It is crucial to scrutinize the company's recent financial statements and performance indicators to understand the rationale behind such a decision. A comprehensive analysis of the company's debt levels, cash flow and revenue growth is essential to assess the potential long-term implications for investors and the company's financial health. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the delisting of Cyteir Therapeutics could be indicative of broader sector trends or specific to the company's competitive positioning. In the biotech industry, where Cyteir operates, the ability to sustain funding for research and development is critical. Delisting may affect the company's visibility in the market and its ability to attract institutional investors, which are vital for ongoing R&D efforts.Examining industry benchmarks and the performance of peer companies can provide context to Cyteir's decision. If Cyteir's move is an outlier, it may represent a unique challenge faced by the company. Conversely, if it aligns with a pattern among similar firms, it could point to a sector-wide issue that stakeholders should monitor closely. Legal Expert The legal implications of delisting are multifaceted and can have significant ramifications. Cyteir's notification to the SEC and Nasdaq involves a formal process that includes regulatory compliance and adherence to securities laws. The Form 25 filing is a critical step in this process and the company must manage this transition carefully to avoid legal pitfalls.Shareholders and potential investors should be aware of their rights and the legal processes involved in delisting. The company's adherence to disclosure requirements and the management of the delisting process will be under scrutiny to ensure that it is conducted in a manner that protects shareholder interests. 03/07/2024 - 04:30 PM LEXINGTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cyteir Therapeutics, Inc.

Barclays is the sole underwriter, with an option for an additional 900,000 shares. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the Offering. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement of a secondary offering by First Watch Restaurant Group, Inc. (FWRG) indicates a notable liquidity event for the Selling Stockholders, in this case, funds managed by Advent International, L.P. From a market research perspective, this event can lead to several implications for the stock's trading dynamics. Firstly, the introduction of additional shares into the market could potentially dilute the stock's value in the short term, as the increase in available shares may lead to downward pressure on the stock price.It is also important to consider the timing and rationale behind such a decision. Secondary offerings are often executed to capitalize on a strong share price performance or to allow early investors to realize gains. The market's reception to this news will be influenced by the company's recent performance and growth prospects. Investors will be closely monitoring the impact of this offering on the company's stock performance, as well as the future strategic moves by Advent International concerning their remaining stake in FWRG. Financial Analyst From a financial standpoint, the secondary offering of 6,000,000 shares, with an option for an additional 900,000, does not directly affect the company's capital structure since the proceeds will go to the Selling Stockholders and not to FWRG's corporate coffers. However, it is essential to analyze the underwriter's role, in this case, Barclays and the terms of the offering. The underwriter's confidence in being able to sell these shares can be a testament to the company's valuation and market sentiment.Investors should assess the potential impact of this offering on the company's earnings per share (EPS), as the secondary offering may lead to changes in the shareholder base and potentially affect the stock's liquidity. Additionally, the use of a shelf registration statement suggests that FWRG is positioning itself for flexibility in capital raising, which could be advantageous for future growth initiatives or acquisitions. Legal Expert In the context of regulatory compliance, the use of a shelf registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a strategic move that facilitates the process of selling shares over a period of time without the need for multiple registrations. This method is compliant with SEC regulations and allows the company to act quickly in response to market conditions or capital needs. Investors should be aware of the legal framework governing such offerings, as they indicate a company's readiness to access capital markets efficiently while adhering to regulatory standards.It's also important to note that the prospectus and other SEC filings provide critical information that can affect investor decisions. These documents often contain details about the company's financial health, risk factors and strategic direction, which are crucial for making informed investment decisions. 03/07/2024 - 04:36 PM BRADENTON, Fla., March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Watch Restaurant Group, Inc.

Merrimack reported a net loss of $1.2 million for 2023, with $18.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Merrimack Pharmaceuticals of their full year 2023 financial results and the subsequent FDA approval for Onivyde® as a first-line treatment for mPDAC is a significant event with potential material impact on the company's financial position and the value proposition for its shareholders. The approval has activated a $225 million milestone payment from Ipsen, which is substantial relative to the company's reported cash position of $18.9 million. This inflow of funds is poised to alter the company's balance sheet considerably.Furthermore, the anticipated liquidating dividend, estimated between $14.65 and $15.35 per share, represents a direct and immediate return to shareholders. This is a pivotal development, especially considering the company's net loss reported at $1.2 million for 2023. The market will likely react to this news, as the liquidating dividend could provide a significant premium over the current trading price, depending on market conditions and investor sentiment towards Merrimack's dissolution plan.It's important to note that while the FDA approval and the ensuing milestone payment are positive, the Board's assessment that no further milestone payments are expected from the agreements with Ipsen and Elevation Oncology could be seen as a cap on future value creation from these sources. Investors should carefully consider the implications of the planned dissolution and the establishment of a liquidating trust in the context of Merrimack's long-term prospects. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The FDA approval of Onivyde® for mPDAC is a significant milestone in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly within the oncology sector. As a first-line treatment, Onivyde® has the potential to capture a larger share of the market, which is critical given the high unmet medical need in metastatic pancreatic cancer. The approval could also have implications for the competitive landscape, potentially affecting the market dynamics and positioning of other treatments.While Merrimack is poised to receive a substantial milestone payment, the company's decision to pursue a Plan of Dissolution suggests a strategic exit from further drug development or commercialization activities. This raises questions about the company's long-term strategy and the future of its intellectual property and drug portfolio. Stakeholders, including potential acquirers or partners, may find the dissolution process and the establishment of a liquidating trust to be of particular interest, as it could present opportunities to acquire valuable assets at a negotiated value. Legal Expert The legal implications of Merrimack's Plan of Dissolution are multifaceted. The establishment of a liquidating trust is a legal mechanism designed to manage and distribute the company's assets post-dissolution. This process will require approval from stockholders, which adds a layer of complexity and requires careful legal consideration to ensure compliance with corporate governance standards and securities regulations.The trust structure is intended to protect the interests of shareholders, particularly in the event of future milestone payments. However, the Board's conclusion that additional payments are unlikely may influence shareholder sentiment during the approval process. From a legal standpoint, the communication and execution of the dissolution plan must be handled with transparency and due diligence to mitigate risks of shareholder disputes or legal challenges. 03/07/2024 - 04:30 PM CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: MACK) (“Merrimack” or the “Company”) today announced its full year 2023 financial results for the period ended December 31, 2023. “As Ipsen reported in February, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the supplemental new drug application for Onivyde® (irinotecan liposome injection) plus 5 fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin (NALIRIFOX) as a first-line treatment for people living with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC),” said Gary Crocker, CEO and Chairman of Merrimack’s Board of Directors. “This approval triggers a $225 million payment which is due from Ipsen to Merrimack before the end of March. We expect to hold a special meeting of stockholders to approve a Plan of Dissolution and a liquidating dividend payable to stockholders. We currently anticipate the initial liquidating dividend to be in the range of between approximately $14.65 and $15.35 per share.” Full Year 2023 Financial Results Merrimack reported net loss of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, or $0.08 per basic share, compared to a net loss of $1.5 million, or $0.11 per basic share, for the same period in 2022. Merrimack reported a gain on sale of assets for the year ended December 31, 2023, of $0.1 million compared to $0.4 million for the same period in 2022. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $2.2 million, compared to $2.2 million for the same period in 2022. As of December 31, 2023, Merrimack had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $18.9 million, compared to $19.4 million as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, Merrimack had 14.4 million shares of common stock outstanding. Updates on Programs Underlying Potential Milestone Payments and Planned Dissolution On February 13, 2024, we announced that Ipsen S.A. announced it had received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to market ONIVYDE as a first-line treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma on the pancreas. As a result of this approval by the FDA, we are entitled to receive a $225 million milestone payment from Ipsen, which is expected to be received by the end of March 2024. Merrimack’s Board of Directors has evaluated the likelihood of receiving additional milestone payments under the Ipsen Agreement and from the 2019 Agreement with Elevation Oncology and has concluded that it is unlikely that any additional milestone payments from either agreement will become payable. The Plan of Dissolution will include establishment of a liquidating trust for the benefit of stockholders in the unlikely event that Merrimack might receive any future milestone payments from Ipsen or Elevation Technology. About Merrimack Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts that is entitled to receive up to $450.0 million in contingent milestone payments related to its sale of Onivyde® to Ipsen S.A. in April 2017. $225 million of these potential milestone payments are tied to the first line metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma potential indication and are expected to be received by the end of March. The remaining milestone payments consist of $150 million tied to the small cell lung cancer potential indication and $75 million is tied to other potential applications Ipsen may elect to pursue. These milestone payments would be payable by Ipsen upon approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) of Onivyde for certain additional clinical indications. Merrimack’s agreement with Ipsen does not require Ipsen to provide Merrimack with any information on the progress of Onivyde clinical trials that is not publicly available. Merrimack is also entitled to receive up to $54.5 million in contingent milestone payments related to its sale of anti-HER3 programs to Elevation Oncology (formerly 14ner Oncology, Inc.) in July 2019.

Negative Revenue declined in both Q4 and full year 2023 compared to the previous year. Net loss increased in Q4 2023. Cash reserves decreased from 2022 to 2023. Gross margin decreased for full year 2023. Non-GAAP operating loss is projected for fiscal year 2024. Financial Analyst The disclosed financials from Markforged Holding Corporation show a mixed picture, with a 20.4% sequential revenue increase in Q4 2023, which is a positive indicator of growth. However, when compared year-over-year, there's a notable decline from $29.7 million to $24.2 million in revenue. This decline could suggest potential market challenges or increased competition. The gross margin improvement from 46.9% to 48.4% indicates better cost management or pricing strategies, which is commendable in a challenging macro environment.From an investor's perspective, the reduction in net loss on a non-GAAP basis from $13.3 million to $11.6 million shows progress towards profitability. However, the drop in cash reserves from $167.9 million to $116.9 million raises concerns about the company's liquidity and long-term financial health. The 33% reduction in net cash used in operating activities is a strong sign of improving operational efficiency.The company's outlook for 2024, with an expected revenue range of $95 - $105 million, suggests cautious optimism. The anticipated non-GAAP gross margins of 48% - 50% align with the improved cost management seen in 2023. However, the projected non-GAAP operating loss indicates that the path to profitability may still be challenging. Market Research Analyst Markforged's performance should be evaluated within the context of the additive manufacturing industry, which is known for its rapid innovation and the introduction of new products. The launch of three new products in 2023, including the FX10, highlights the company's commitment to maintaining a competitive edge. The strong initial demand for the FX10, expected to begin shipping in the first half of 2024, could be a significant growth driver.The 25% year-over-year increase in services revenue, driven by subscription sales, is indicative of a strategic shift towards recurring revenue models, which can provide more predictable income streams and enhance customer retention. The expansion with Automation Alley and the sale of additional printers for the Project DIAMOnD initiative represent strategic wins that could lead to further market penetration and long-term growth.However, the acknowledgment of macroeconomic headwinds and slow capital expenditures in 2023 reflects the broader economic uncertainty that may continue to affect the company's performance. The focus on the second half of the year for accelerated growth suggests that the company is anticipating a rebound in market conditions or the realization of gains from its strategic initiatives. Manufacturing Industry Expert Markforged's emphasis on strengthening manufacturing resiliency is particularly relevant given current global supply chain challenges. The company's Digital Forge solutions and on-demand platform for 3D printing OEM certified parts are positioned to address the need for cost reduction and supply chain agility. The company's ability to deliver 20% sequential revenue growth in Q4 amidst a challenging macro environment speaks to the efficacy of its cost controls and operational efficiencies.The Automation Alley partnership expansion and the robust utilization rates across the global fleet suggest that Markforged's additive manufacturing solutions are gaining traction in the industry. The focus on building more resilient supply chains remains a long-term tailwind, which may drive demand for the company's products despite short-term economic pressures.The introduction of new products like the FX10, which is designed to enhance manufacturing productivity, indicates that Markforged is investing in innovation to meet the evolving needs of the industry. The company's product portfolio expansion could be critical in maintaining a competitive advantage and capturing market share in the growing additive manufacturing sector. 03/07/2024 - 04:30 PM WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Markforged Holding Corporation (NYSE: MKFG) (the “Company”), the company strengthening manufacturing resiliency by enabling industrial production at the point of need, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Compared To Fourth Quarter 2022 Revenue was $24.2 million, up 20.4% sequentially from the third quarter of 2023, and down from $29.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross margin was 48.4% compared to 46.9%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 49.5% compared to 47.5%. Operating expenses were $31.1 million, inclusive of an increase in the fair value estimate of an acquisition earnout of $0.9 million, compared to $33.2 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $24.9 million compared to $29.4 million. Net loss was $14.2 million compared to net loss of $10.7 million. Non-GAAP net loss was $11.6 million compared to a loss of $13.3 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $116.9 million as of December 31, 2023 compared to $167.9 million as of December 31, 2022. Full Year 2023 Financial Results Compared To Full Year 2022 Revenue was $93.8 million compared to $101.0 million. Gross margin was 47.4% compared to 50.2%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 48.6% compared to 50.8%. Net cash used in operating activities was $48.9 million compared to $73.5 million. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures provided in this press release to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the financial tables included at the end of this press release. An explanation of these measures and how they are calculated is also included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” “We ended the year with positive momentum as we continued to execute our strategy to lead the adoption of additive manufacturing on the factory floor,” said Shai Terem, President and CEO of Markforged. “Although in the near term we expect elevated interest rates will continue to impact capital spending, the need for manufacturers to reduce costs and build more resilient supply chains remains a long-term tailwind driving demand for the Digital Forge. We have a strong product portfolio and are encouraged by robust utilization across our global fleet network. We look forward to realizing the growth potential our new products provide, especially in the second half of the year. We believe this, combined with our tight cost controls and strong balance sheet, keeps us on a clear path to profitability.” Business Updates Strong Execution in a Challenging Macro Environment. While slow capital expenditures in 2023 delayed system sales, Markforged delivered 20% sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Supported by effective cost controls, Markforged exceeded its 2023 gross margin and operating cost targets. Net cash used in operating activities in 2023 decreased by $24.6 million, approximately 33% from 2022, driven by improving operational and working capital efficiencies. Automation Alley Expansion Win. During the fourth quarter, Markforged expanded its relationship with Automation Alley through the sale of an additional 125 OnyxPro printers for its Project DIAMOnD initiative. This is an expansion beyond the 300 printers Automation Alley acquired in 2021. This win is part of a strategic partnership between Automation Alley and Digital Source, Markforged’s on-demand platform for 3D printing OEM certified parts. Robust Utilization Across the Global Fleet. The health of Markforged’s global printer network remains robust as customers solve ever more factory floor challenges using their Digital Forge solutions. Markforged realized strong growth in subscription sales, which helped drive services revenues up 25% year-over-year in 2023. Markforged expects these strong utilization rates and the resulting recurring revenue streams they produce to grow in 2024. Entering 2024 With the Strongest Product Portfolio in the Company’s History. Markforged launched three important new products in 2023, the FX10, Vega, and Digital Source. Building on the precision and reliability of the X7, the FX10 is nearly twice as large and twice as fast as its predecessor and is built to supercharge manufacturing productivity and profitability. Markforged has seen strong initial demand for the FX10 and remains on plan to begin shipping in the first half of 2024. With these new products, alongside the FX20, PX100, and the rest of the Company’s industrial printer lineup, Markforged enters 2024 with the strongest product portfolio in the Company’s history. Markforged Announces Assaf Zipori as Chief Financial Officer Markforged also announced today that Assaf Zipori, Markforged’s Acting Chief Financial Officer, has assumed the role of Chief Financial Officer. “I am very pleased to announce the appointment of Assaf as our CFO,” said Shai Terem. “Assaf has been a key member of our executive team for over four years and has repeatedly demonstrated the business acumen and leadership to head our financial organization. I’m confident in his continued leadership to help us on our journey to profitable growth.” Zipori has deep experience since joining Markforged more than four years ago. He served as Acting Chief Financial Officer from November 2019 through March 2021 and again from May 2023 until March 2024, and as Markforged’s head of Strategy and Corporate Development since April 2021. “Since joining Markforged I’ve been inspired by our fantastic team, the power of our technology and our mission to bring industrial production to the point of need. I am grateful for this opportunity and am confident in our team’s ability to drive success,” said Zipori. 2024 Financial Outlook Markforged anticipates fiscal year 2024 revenues to be within the range of $95 - $105 million. In line with seasonal industry trends, Markforged expects to see the normal mid-teen percentage sequential revenue decline in the first quarter and then expects revenues to grow sequentially throughout the year. While Markforged’s guidance acknowledges the persistence of macroeconomic headwinds throughout the year, Markforged holds a more positive outlook for the second half of the year, accompanied by accelerated growth. Our positive outlook is underpinned by the introduction of new products, particularly the FX10. Markforged expects non-GAAP gross margins to be within the range of 48% - 50%. Non-GAAP operating loss is expected to be in the range of $42.5 million - $47.0 million for the year, resulting in a non-GAAP loss per share in the range of $0.19 - $0.22 per share.

Amounts herein pertaining to December 31, 2023 represent a preliminary estimate as of the date of this earnings release and may be revised upon filing our Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). More information on our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 will be provided upon filing our Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to our financial results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we believe that each of non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating profit (loss), non-GAAP net profit (loss) and non-GAAP earnings per share, each a non-GAAP financial measure, is useful in evaluating the performance of our business. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as an analytical tool. We do not, nor do we suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors should also note that the non-GAAP financial measures we use may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as that of other companies, including other companies in our industry. We recommend that you review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release, and that you not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. Additionally, to the extent that forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures are provided, they are presented on a non-GAAP basis without reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP measures due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations. Investors should note that beginning with the second quarter of 2022, we have modified the presentation of “non-recurring costs” included in non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating profit (loss), non-GAAP net profit (loss) and non-GAAP earnings per share metrics to include certain non-recurring litigation costs. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2022, we modified the presentation to remove the impact of the amortization of our intangible assets. We use these metrics to provide an understanding of the results of our core business performance and believe these litigation and amortization costs are not indicative of the performance of our core business’ operations. This change increases “non-recurring costs'' by $0.6 million, $1.0 million, $0.8 million, and $1.4 million in the first through fourth quarters of 2022, respectively. The exclusion of amortization impacts non-GAAP net profit (loss) by $5.0 thousand, $37.0 thousand, and $104.0 thousand in the second through fourth quarters of 2022, respectively. To conform to the current period’s presentation, we have included non-recurring litigation costs as “non-recurring costs” when presenting the foregoing non-GAAP figures for the year to date period. The following are the non-GAAP financial measures referenced in this press release and presented in the tables below: Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as GAAP gross profit (loss), less stock-based compensation expense, amortization, and certain non-recurring costs, divided by revenue. Non-GAAP operating profit (loss) is defined as GAAP operating profit (loss) less stock-based compensation expense, amortization, and certain non-recurring costs. Non-GAAP net profit (loss) is defined as GAAP net profit (loss) less stock-based compensation expense, net change in fair value of warrant liabilities and contingent earnout liabilities, amortization, and certain non-recurring costs. Non-GAAP earnings per share is defined as GAAP net profit (loss) less stock-based compensation expense, net change in fair value of warrant liabilities and contingent earnout liabilities, amortization, and certain non-recurring costs, divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the period.

Academy Sports + Outdoors Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend,2024-03-07T22:10:00.000Z,Low,Very Negative,"Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. (ASO) increases quarterly dividend by 22% to $0.11 per share for the fiscal quarter ended February 3, 2024.","Academy Sports + Outdoors Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Negative) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. (ASO) increases quarterly dividend by 22% to $0.11 per share for the fiscal quarter ended February 3, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc.'s increased quarterly cash dividend is a positive signal for investors, indicative of the company's financial health and management's confidence in its cash flow stability and future earnings. The 22% increase in dividend payout is substantial, surpassing the more common single-digit percentage increases seen in stable dividend-paying companies. It is crucial to assess the payout ratio to ensure that the dividend is sustainable and not at the expense of necessary capital reinvestment or debt reduction.Furthermore, an increased dividend can attract income-focused investors, potentially leading to a more stable shareholder base. However, investors should also consider the overall yield in the context of the current share price to determine the attractiveness of the investment relative to other opportunities. Market Research Analyst The retail sector, particularly sporting goods, is highly competitive and Academy Sports and Outdoors' ability to increase its dividend may reflect a competitive advantage or a strong market position. It is important to analyze the company's recent earnings reports, sales growth and market share trends to understand the underlying drivers of this financial decision.Additionally, the timing of the dividend increase could be strategic, aligning with broader economic conditions or consumer spending trends. Understanding the macroeconomic environment and consumer behavior can provide insights into the potential long-term sustainability of the company's growth and its ability to maintain or increase dividends in the future. Economist Dividend policy changes, such as the one announced by Academy Sports and Outdoors, can be influenced by broader economic factors. In a low-interest-rate environment, an increase in dividends can make a company's stock more attractive compared to fixed-income alternatives. Conversely, if interest rates are rising, the relative appeal of dividend stocks might diminish.Investors should also consider the potential impact of inflation on disposable income and consumer spending, as these factors could affect the company's future revenue and profitability. An understanding of fiscal and monetary policies, as well as consumer confidence indices, can provide a more comprehensive view of the potential risks and opportunities for the company in the current economic climate. 03/07/2024 - 05:10 PM KATY, Texas, March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc.

Whitestone REIT Board of Trustees Rejects Nomination of Two Erez Candidates,2024-03-07T22:01:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Whitestone REIT rejects Erez Asset Management's board nominees due to lack of understanding of the company's operations and focus on asset sale proposal, highlighting strong shareholder returns and governance improvements.","Whitestone REIT Board of Trustees Rejects Nomination of Two Erez Candidates Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Whitestone REIT rejects Erez Asset Management's board nominees due to lack of understanding of the company's operations and focus on asset sale proposal, highlighting strong shareholder returns and governance improvements. Positive None. Negative Erez Asset Management's nominees lacked understanding of Whitestone's portfolio and business strategy, focusing solely on a proposal for asset sale which the Whitestone Board deemed unsuitable for maximizing shareholder value. 03/07/2024 - 05:01 PM HOUSTON, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Whitestone REIT received notice that Erez Asset Management, LLC (""Erez"") has nominated two candidates to stand for election to the Board of Trustees of Whitestone REIT (the “Whitestone Board”) at the 2024 annual meeting. The Whitestone REIT Nominating and Governance Committee (“the Committee”) has conducted a comprehensive review and evaluation of Erez candidates Bruce Schanzer and Catherine Clark. Our review and evaluation process included individual interviews with both candidates (and an additional interview with a third Erez candidate, who has withdrawn his candidacy), a thorough review of the backgrounds and track records of both candidates, and responses to our follow-up questions post interviews. The interviews took place on February 1, 2024, for Mr. Schanzer and on February 5, 2024, for Mrs. Clark. The Committee had follow-up questions and requested supplemental information on February 9, 2024, which it received on February 13, 2024. Pursuant to the recommendation of the Committee, the Whitestone Board will not nominate either candidate. During their interviews, neither candidate recommended any changes to the Company’s business or financial strategy, or its corporate governance. Furthermore (and surprisingly), neither displayed more than a cursory understanding of Whitestone’s portfolio, its markets, or its business strategy during their interviews. Both remained fixated on Mr. Schanzer’s original and vague proposal advocating for “a sale of assets or of the company outright” as the only way to generate shareholder value. The Whitestone Board continuously evaluates all avenues to maximize value for shareholders and is always committed to advancing their best interests. Given the strong total shareholder returns generated for Whitestone shareholders since the new executive team was appointed in January 2022, both Erez candidates ignore the reality of Whitestone’s sector-leading performance and the obligation of board members to properly evaluate all avenues for value creation. The Whitestone Board has strong retail REIT experience, as well as experience across a full range of disciplines that enhance their oversight capabilities. Details on board member qualifications can be found on Whitestone's investor relations website. Whitestone’s Board and Management team regularly engages with its shareholders and has received strong support from the majority of the shareholder base related to decisions driving company performance and to governance improvements made over the course of the last two years. The Whitestone Board will present its formal recommendation on the nominees in the Company's definitive proxy statement, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and mailed to all shareholders eligible to vote at the 2024 Annual Meeting. The date of the Company's 2024 Annual Meeting has not yet been announced. Whitestone REIT shareholders are not required to take any action at this time.

(NASDAQ: VINP) announces a transformative agreement with Compass to create a full-service Latin American alternative asset manager with over US$50 billion in assets under management. The transaction solidifies Vinci's position as a gateway to alternative asset management in Latin America and is expected to be immediately accretive to FRE per Share. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The merger between Vinci Partners and Compass is a strategic move that could significantly alter the competitive landscape of the alternative investment market in Latin America. With an expected increase in assets under management to over US$50 billion, the combined entity is poised to become a dominant player in the region. This scale of AUM is crucial as it typically translates to enhanced bargaining power with service providers, the ability to attract and retain top investment talent and the potential to offer more competitive investment products to clients.Furthermore, the transaction's immediate accretiveness to Fee-Related Earnings (FRE) per Share is a critical metric for investors. FRE provides a clear view of the profitability derived from the core business operations, excluding performance-based earnings which can be volatile. An increase in FRE per share suggests that the merger should positively impact Vinci's earnings in a stable and predictable manner, which is generally well-received by the market.However, it is important to consider the integration risks that come with such transactions. The process of combining two different corporate cultures, systems and processes can be complex and costly. Investors should monitor the company's ability to realize the projected synergies and maintain the strong performance track record of both entities post-merger. Market Research Analyst The expansion into eight countries and the establishment of a leading pan-regional platform positions Vinci to capitalize on the growing demand for alternative investments in Latin America. This region has been experiencing an increase in institutional and High Net Worth Individual (HNWI) interest in diversifying portfolios beyond traditional asset classes. The merger allows Vinci to offer a comprehensive product suite, including private markets, investment products and solutions, public equities and corporate advisory services, which could be a significant competitive advantage.Moreover, the ability to provide local-to-local, global-to-local and global-to-regional investment opportunities is a testament to the nuanced understanding of the LatAm market that the new entity will possess. This could result in tailored investment strategies that resonate with the specific needs and regulatory environments of Latin American investors, potentially leading to increased client acquisition and retention. Economist The alternative asset management industry in Latin America is in a growth phase, driven by macroeconomic factors such as the search for yield in a low-interest-rate environment and the rise of the middle class with investable assets. The consolidation of Vinci and Compass could be seen as a response to these market dynamics, aiming to provide a diversified set of investment products to meet the sophisticated demands of the growing investor base.It is also worth noting that the entry of a major player like Vinci into new markets could stimulate competition and innovation within the local alternative investment sectors. This could lead to broader economic benefits, such as increased capital inflows and support for regional businesses through various funding mechanisms. However, the success of such a strategy will largely depend on the execution of the merger and the subsequent integration of the two firms' operations and investment philosophies. 03/07/2024 - 05:10 PM Combined platform will have more than US$50 billion in assets under management1;Vinci to expand its geographical footprint across eight countries, establishing a leading pan-regional platform;Vinci to solidify its position as the gateway to alternative asset management in Latin America, becoming a full-service platform with local-to-local, local-to-global, global-to-local and global-to-regional investment opportunities;Transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to FRE per Share.RIO DE JANEIRO, March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Vinci Partners Investments Ltd.

Compass has developed a leading and differentiated platform in LatAm, with US$37 billion in assets under management and advisory, distributed across two main business lines: (i) IP&S, as pioneers in providing investment solutions across traditional and global alternative assets, to institutional investors, family offices, intermediaries and HNWI in Latin America. Compass has built a distinguished ecosystem of proprietary relationships over the last 28 years, providing access to world-class managers and global brokerage services, as well as discretionary global investment solutions and asset allocation to Latin American investors; (ii) Asset Management Latam: More than 25-year history of managing a wide range of funds and investment strategies focused exclusively on Latin America, through: a) Credit, by managing funds and portfolios across the full spectrum of risk, from investment grade to private credit, including LatAm high-yield strategies, and b) Public Equities, by managing pan-LatAm and country-specific equity funds and mandates for Latin American and global clients. ""This combination with Compass marks the most significant step so far in our long-term strategic growth plan presented at our Investor Day, allowing us to expand our footprint into Latin America, one of the most attractive markets for alternatives,"" said Alessandro Horta, Chief Executive Officer of Vinci Partners. ""Together, we will become a true pan-regional platform, and create a leading player in Latin America, expanding our geographic footprint and strengthening our combined business through complementary products, broader geographic coverage and more diversified revenue and funding bases. We believe this transaction consolidates Vinci's position as the gateway to alternative investments in Latin America, as investors gain unparalleled access to the full-suite of alternative investments across the region, and we will be able to meet our stakeholders' investment needs on a local-to-local, global-to-local, local-to-global and global-to-regional basis."" ""We are thrilled to partner with a leader in alternative investments in Brazil and are excited about the future opportunities for our combined platform alongside Vinci,"" said Jaime Martí, partner and Chief Executive Officer of Compass. ""Over the last 28 years, we have built a strong reputation through our extensive distribution network and track record in Latin America. Combining with Vinci is the perfect complementary move, as we gain access to a leading and diverse set of alternative investment opportunities in Brazil. Our shared vision includes offering the best Latin American investment solutions to global investors and providing global solutions to Latin American investors. There is a significant opportunity to grow in LatAm, and the combination with Vinci will allow us to develop new regional products leveraging on their extensive capabilities as well as expand our product base into Brazil through Vinci´s distribution relationships.""

Under the agreement, Compass partners are entitled to an earn-out of up to an additional 7.5% stake in the combined entity, subject to the achievement of pre-determined metrics, to be paid in VINP Class A common stock until 2028.

Likewise, for the 2024 calendar year, we are assuming that mortality in Canada and the United States remains flat to slightly depressed as a result of the impact from the pull-forward effect associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, in the near term and for the 2024 calendar year, we anticipate that corporate costs will remain relatively consistent with prior periods as we continue to enhance our corporate support facilities and resources, and continue to pursue M&A growth.The purpose of the 2024 Financial Outlook is to assist investors, shareholders, and others in understanding certain financial metrics relating to expected 2024 financial results for evaluating the performance of the Company's business.

The increase in revenue by 2.7% for the full year and 1.3% for the fourth quarter, although modest, suggests stability in the company's operations. More notably, the substantial improvement in net loss from $150.1 million in 2022 to $75.7 million in 2023 reflects effective cost control measures and operational streamlining.Adjusted EBITDA, a key indicator of a company's operating profitability, saw a remarkable increase of 155.1% year-over-year, signaling enhanced operational efficiency. This is a positive sign for investors, as it suggests that the company's core operations are becoming more profitable. However, the gross margin decline in Q4 2023 points to challenges in project mix and increased direct costs, which could be a concern if the trend continues.The reduction in Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative Expense by 8.2% for the full year is indicative of successful cost-cutting initiatives. However, investors should monitor whether these reductions can be sustained without negatively impacting the company's growth potential. The company's focus on reducing costs and improving cash flow is commendable, but it remains to be seen if these efforts will translate into long-term financial stability and shareholder value. Market Research Analyst Team, Inc.'s strategic focus on cost reduction and operational efficiency is aligned with broader industry trends where companies are streamlining operations to improve margins. Their emphasis on expanding Adjusted EBITDA margin and generating positive Free Cash Flow aligns with investor expectations for industrial service providers to optimize capital allocation and maintain liquidity.The company's targeted commercial initiatives aiming to leverage customer relationships and technical capabilities suggest a proactive approach to driving organic growth. This could be particularly significant given the competitive nature of the specialty industrial services market. However, it is crucial to assess the effectiveness of these strategies in the context of industry activity levels and macroeconomic conditions.The mention of a thorough review of commercial strategy indicates that Team, Inc. is looking to refine its market approach, which could potentially unlock new growth avenues. Investors should look forward to the conclusions from this review for insights into the company's long-term strategic direction and its capacity to capture market share in core and adjacent markets. Economist The financial results of Team, Inc. should be considered within the broader economic context. The company's performance, particularly the increase in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, suggests resilience amid potential macroeconomic headwinds such as inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions. The improvements in net loss and cost structure adjustments indicate a strategic response to these challenges.The company's ability to generate Free Cash Flow in the fourth quarter is a positive indicator of liquidity management, which is crucial for maintaining operations and investing in growth during uncertain economic times. However, the reported increase in legal reserves could be indicative of potential liabilities that may impact future financials.Investors should also consider the impact of foreign exchange rate movements, which negatively affected revenue growth by approximately $2.3 million. This highlights the importance of currency risk management in multinational operations. The company's debt level, with a net debt of $276.0 million, should be carefully evaluated against its cash flow generating capabilities and the broader interest rate environment. 03/07/2024 - 04:45 PM SUGAR LAND, Texas, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Team, Inc. (NYSE: TISI) (“TEAM” or the “Company”), a global, leading provider of specialty industrial services offering clients access to a full suite of conventional, specialized, and proprietary mechanical, heat-treating, and inspection services, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights1: Announced fourth quarter 2023 revenues of $214.1 million, up 1.3% over the 2022 fourth quarter revenue of $211.3 million.Reported fourth quarter 2023 net loss of $23.1 million, a $33.8 million improvement from the 2022 fourth quarter net loss of $56.9 million.Improved consolidated Adjusted EBITDA2 to $9.7 million (4.5% of consolidated revenue), an increase of 45.1% from $6.7 million (3.2% of consolidated revenue) in the fourth quarter of 2022.Reduced Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative Expense2 by 9.2%, or $4.5 million, as compared to the 2022 period.Generated cash flow from operations of $11.1 million and Free Cash Flow2 of $8.1 million for the period. Full Year 2023 Highlights1: Increased 2023 revenue to $862.6 million, up 2.7% or $22.4 million from 2022.Improved gross margin to $211.2 million, or 24.5% of revenue, as compared to $201.6 million, or 24.0% of revenue, in 2022.Reported 2023 net loss of $75.7 million, a $74.4 million improvement over net loss of $150.1 million in 2022.Grew 2023 consolidated Adjusted EBITDA2 to $42.5 million, a 155.1% improvement as compared to $16.7 million in 2022.Reduced Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative Expense2 by 8.2%, or $16.4 million, as compared to 2022. 1 Unless otherwise specified, the financial information and discussion in this earnings release is based on the Company’s continuing operations (IHT and MS segments as defined below) and excludes results of its discontinued operations due to the sale of Quest Integrity business (“Quest Integrity”) on November 1, 2022. 2 See the accompanying reconciliation of non-GAAP measures at the end of this press release. “Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrated meaningful progress in our ongoing program to lower our cost structure and streamline operations while maintaining best in class safety and service quality. In the fourth quarter, we expanded our Adjusted EBITDA margin by nearly 140 basis points to 4.5%, representing a 45% increase in Adjusted EBITDA to $9.7 million on relatively modest revenue growth,” said Keith D. Tucker, Team’s Chief Executive Officer. “For the full year, we grew revenue 2.7% while delivering Adjusted EBITDA of $42.5 million, up 155% over 2022, and an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 4.9%, more than double the margin for 2022.” Mr. Tucker commented further on the Company’s progress executing its improvement plan: “Throughout 2023, we prioritized reducing our cost structure, expanding margins and increasing cash flow by implementing cost reductions that we expect to yield at least $16.0 million per year in annualized savings. Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrated tangible progress against those goals through an expanded Adjusted EBITDA margin and, for the fourth quarter, $8.1 million of positive Free Cash Flow. I am grateful for the hard work and dedication of our employees during this pivotal year and for their continued focus on our ongoing efforts to build a financially stronger TEAM.” “Looking ahead, we expect to further capitalize on this operational and financial momentum through targeted commercial initiatives that leverage our deep customer relationships and extensive technical capabilities. We will also plan to continue focusing on further reducing our cost structure, and in the first quarter of 2024, we implemented additional targeted cost reductions that we expect to yield $4.0 million of annual savings and identified additional opportunities to lower our costs without negatively impacting service quality or safety. We believe these initiatives, coupled with stronger industry activity levels, will drive additional improvement in our financial position,” commented Tucker. “In the fourth quarter of 2023, utilizing both internal and external resources, we began a thorough review of our commercial strategy designed to hone our focus and further identify and unlock what we see as significant opportunities for long-term organic growth in both our core and select adjacent markets. Concurrent with our upcoming first quarter earnings release, we plan to provide an investor update on the conclusions from our commercial review, our significant operational progress made to date and our longer-term objectives targeted to further unlock the intrinsic value of TEAM,” concluded Tucker. Financial Results Fourth quarter revenues were up $2.8 million to $214.1 million as compared to $211.3 million in the prior-year period. The increase was driven by higher Inspection and Heat Treating (“IHT”) revenue of $4.6 million, partially offset by lower Mechanical Services (“MS”) revenue of $1.8 million. In the fourth quarter of 2023, consolidated gross margin was $50.4 million, or 23.6% of revenue, down 120 basis points from 24.8%, or $52.4 million, in the same quarter a year ago. Gross margin for the quarter was impacted by a less favorable project mix, and higher direct costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter were $59.3 million, up by $2.1 million, or 3.7%, from the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher legal reserves. Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative Expense, which excludes expenses not representative of TEAM’s ongoing operations as well as non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expense, declined by $4.5 million as compared to the 2022 period and $1.1 million as compared to the third quarter of 2023, driven mainly by lower personnel costs and professional fees resulting from the Company’s ongoing cost reduction efforts. Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $23.1 million (a loss of $5.25 per share) compared to a net loss of $56.9 million (a loss of $13.15 per share) in the 2022 fourth quarter. The 2022 period included a loss on debt extinguishment of $30.1 million due to the paydown of $225.0 million of debt in early November. The Company’s adjusted measure of net income/loss, consolidated Adjusted EBIT, a non-GAAP measure, was a loss of $0.4 million in the 2023 fourth quarter compared to a loss of $2.0 million in the prior year quarter. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was $9.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 up 45.1% compared to $6.7 million for the prior-year quarter. For the full year 2023, consolidated revenues were $862.6 million, up 2.7% compared to $840.2 million in 2022. Unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements throughout 2023 negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately $2.3 million. Gross margin for the year grew to $211.2 million (24.5% of revenue) as compared to $201.6 million (24.0% of revenue) in 2022, primarily due to an increase in activity levels and project mix. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2023 were $224.4 million, down $17.0 million, or 7.0%, compared to 2022, primarily due to lower personnel costs and professional fees resulting from the Company’s ongoing cost reduction efforts. Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative Expense declined by $16.4 million compared to the 2022 period for the reasons noted above. Net loss was $75.7 million, or a loss of $17.32 per share, compared to a net loss of $150.1 million, or a loss of $35.85 per share, in 2022. Net loss for 2023 and 2022 includes a loss on debt extinguishment of $1.6 million and $30.1 million, respectively, due to debt repayment. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was $42.5 million for 2023, up 155.1% compared to $16.7 million in 2022, reflecting the Company’s cost reduction efforts combined with improved margins due to higher activity levels, improvements on pricing and more favorable job mix. Adjusted net loss, consolidated Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative Expense are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items that are not indicative of TEAM’s core operating activities. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is at the end of this earnings release. Segment Results The following table illustrates the composition of the Company’s revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for the quarters ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands): TEAM, INC.

IHT’s revenue increased by $4.6 million, or 4.5%, for the 2023 fourth quarter as compared to prior year period, primarily due to higher callout and turnaround activities in the U.S. and Europe regions. MS revenue decreased by $1.8 million or 1.6%, for the quarter with increases in leak repair and hot tapping revenue in international areas (excluding Canada) of $4.7 million offset by lower period over period revenue in the U.S. and Canada due to turnaround projects that did not repeat in the 2023 quarter. Operating income (loss). IHT’s fourth quarter 2023 operating income increased by $2.5 million to $6.5 million due to higher activity levels combined with the realized effects of cost reductions implemented throughout 2023. MS operating income was lower compared to prior year quarter by approximately $0.4 million. Corporate and shared support services costs increased by $6.1 million primarily due to higher legal reserves recorded in the 2023 period. Consolidated operating loss increased by $4.0 million driven by the factors discussed above. The following table illustrates the composition of the Company’s revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands): TEAM, INC.

IHT revenues increased by $7.0 million, or 1.7%, over the prior year, driven mainly by revenue increases of $10.3 million in the U.S. due to higher callout and turnaround activities, $5.1 million in Europe due to higher turnaround activity primarily in the Netherlands, and $1.5 million in our aerospace business. These increases were partially offset by a $9.9 million decrease in Canada due to reduced scope in certain client turnaround projects. MS revenue increased by $15.4 million, or 3.7%, over the prior year, driven by a $16.7 million increase across our international regions (excluding Canada) due to higher activity related to leak repair, machining and bolting, and hot tapping services in the United Kingdom and Europe, partially offset by $1.0 million of lower revenue in Canada due to non-repeating turnaround work. Operating income (loss). IHT’s operating income increased by $7.1 million to $24.2 million, primarily driven by higher activity as described above. MS operating income increased by $6.8 million year over year to $27.8 million for 2023, mainly due to increased activity levels from international operations, partially offset by a decrease in operating income from our valve business. Corporate operating loss decreased by $12.6 million year over year, mainly due to lower personnel and professional costs in the current year attributable to our ongoing cost reduction efforts. The impact of our cost reduction efforts has been partially offset by continued cost inflation across all segments in areas such as raw materials, insurance, transportation, and labor costs. Balance Sheet and Liquidity At December 31, 2023, the Company had $61.7 million of total liquidity, consisting of consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $30.4 million, (excluding $5.0 million of restricted cash) and $31.3 million in undrawn availability under its various credit facilities. At March 5, 2024, the Company had $36.1 million of total liquidity, consisting of consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $24.0 million (excluding $4.9 million held mainly as collateral for outstanding letters of credit) and approximately $12.1 million of undrawn availability under its various credit facilities. The seasonality in the Company’s business activity drove the expected reduction in total liquidity from year end 2023. The Company typically experiences negative working capital and liquidity impacts in the run up to the higher activity routinely experienced during the spring and fall turnaround seasons, when these negative working capital trends have historically reversed. The Company’s total debt as of December 31, 2023 was $311.4 million as compared to $285.9 million as of fiscal year end 2022. The Company’s net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents), a non-GAAP financial measure, was $276.0 million at December 31, 2023. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The non-GAAP measures in this earnings release are provided to enable investors, analysts and management to evaluate Team’s performance excluding the effects of certain items that management believes impact the comparability of operating results between reporting periods. These measures should be used in addition to, and not in lieu of, results prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). A reconciliation of each of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable historical GAAP financial measure is contained in the accompanying schedule for each of the fiscal periods indicated.

TEAM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations(Unaudited) The Company uses supplemental non-GAAP financial measures which are derived from the consolidated financial information including adjusted net income (loss); adjusted net income (loss) per share; earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”); Adjusted EBIT (defined below); adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), free cash flow and net debt to supplement financial information presented on a GAAP basis. The Company defines adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share to exclude the following items: non-routine legal costs and settlements, non-routine professional fees, loss on debt extinguishment, certain severance charges, non-routine write off of assets and certain other items that we believe are not indicative of core operating activities. Consolidated Adjusted EBIT, as defined by us, excludes the costs excluded from adjusted net income (loss) as well as income tax expense (benefit), interest charges, foreign currency (gain) loss, and items of other (income) expense. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA further excludes from consolidated Adjusted EBIT depreciation, amortization and non-cash share-based compensation costs. Segment Adjusted EBIT is equal to segment operating income (loss) excluding costs associated with non-routine legal costs and settlements, non-routine professional fees, certain severance charges, and certain other items as determined by management. Segment Adjusted EBITDA further excludes from segment Adjusted EBIT depreciation, amortization, and non-cash share-based compensation costs. Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative Expense is defined to exclude non-routine legal costs and settlements, non-routine professional fees, certain severance charges, certain other items that we believe are not indicative of core operating activities and non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization and non-cash compensation. Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities minus capital expenditures. Net debt is defined as the sum of the current and long-term portions of debt, including finance lease obligations, less cash and cash equivalents. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to both management and investors in their analysis of our financial position and results of operations. In particular, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per share, consolidated Adjusted EBIT, and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA are meaningful measures of performance which are commonly used by industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies to analyze operating performance in our industry, perform analytical comparisons, benchmark performance between periods, and measure our performance against externally communicated targets. Our segment Adjusted EBIT and segment Adjusted EBITDA are also used as a basis for the Chief Operating Decision Maker to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments. Free cash flow is used by our management and investors to analyze our ability to service and repay debt and return value directly to stakeholders. Non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and operating income. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Further, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies who may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.

(METC) reported strong financial results for Q4 2023 with adjusted EBITDA of $58.5 million, net income of $30.0 million, and record liquidity of $91 million. The company repaid debt, increased sales commitments, and raised guidance for 2024. Management highlights growth trajectory and debt reduction. Positive Strong Q4 2023 results with adjusted EBITDA of $58.5 million and net income of $30.0 million. Record liquidity of $91 million and debt reduction by $55 million in 2023. Increased sales commitments to 3.9 million tons for 2024, raising sales and production guidance. Purchase of coal preparation plant to reduce costs and enhance operational efficiency. Extension and increase of Revolver facility to $275 million for future growth plans. Expected release of updated Exploration Target report on rare earth deposit in Wyoming. Company's focus on growth strategy, debt reduction, dividend growth, and commercial development of REE project. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Ramaco Resources, Inc. for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 indicate a significant quarterly improvement in Adjusted EBITDA and net income, with the former increasing by 29% and the latter by 54% compared to the third quarter of 2023. However, when compared to the full-year results of 2022, there is a noticeable decline in both metrics, with Adjusted EBITDA and net income decreasing by 11% and 29%, respectively. This suggests that while the company has made strides in the short-term, it faces challenges in maintaining the previous year's financial performance levels.From an investment perspective, the reduction in term debt by $55 million and the record liquidity of $91 million are positive signs of strong balance sheet management. The company's ability to retire all debt in 2024 and secure a larger Revolver facility indicates a robust financial position that could support future growth initiatives. However, investors should be mindful of the potential impact of commodity price fluctuations on the company's profitability, especially given the significant proportion of sales tied to index-linked pricing for export markets. Market Research Analyst The metallurgical coal market dynamics, as reflected in Ramaco Resources' performance, show a strategic shift towards increasing production and sales rates, achieving a 4 million ton per annum run rate in the second half of 2023. The company's growth strategy and operational efficiency are evidenced by the increase in production and sales volumes, as well as the reduction in cash costs of sales per ton. The purchase and planned relocation of an existing coal preparation plant, which is expected to reduce trucking and mine cash costs, is a strategic investment that could enhance operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness in the long run.Looking at the 2024 outlook, the company's anticipation of a sales run-rate above guidance by year-end 2024 and the completion of the coal preparation plant by the fourth quarter are key factors that could drive further growth. However, the reliance on export markets and index-linked pricing introduces a degree of risk related to global economic conditions and commodity price volatility. Legal Expert The agreement to extend and increase the size of the existing Revolver facility with KeyBank, NA and the bank syndicate is a strategic financial maneuver that provides Ramaco Resources with increased liquidity and financial flexibility. The new facility terms, including an accordion feature, indicate lender confidence in the company's creditworthiness and future prospects. This financial backing is crucial for the company's growth and expansion plans.Additionally, the upcoming release of the updated Exploration Target report on the company's rare earth deposit in Wyoming and the subsequent analyst and investor conference call suggest that Ramaco Resources is diversifying its portfolio, potentially tapping into the growing market for rare earth elements (REEs). The successful commercial development of the REE project could represent a significant new business avenue for the company, though it also introduces regulatory and market risks that will need to be navigated carefully. 03/07/2024 - 04:54 PM LEXINGTON, Ky., March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ramaco Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ: METC, METCB, ""Ramaco"" or the ""Company""), a leading operator and developer of high-quality, low-cost metallurgical coal, today reported financial results for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2023. FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2023 HIGHLIGHTS For the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company had adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, certain non-operating expenses, and equity-based compensation (""Adjusted EBITDA"", a non-GAAP measure), of $58.5 million, compared to $45.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Company had Adjusted EBITDA of $182.1 million compared to $204.6 million in 2022. (See ""Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measure"" below.)For the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company had net income of $30.0 million, compared to $19.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Company had net income of $82.3 million, compared to $116.0 million in 2022. While EPS is a complicated comparative measure due to the mid-year 2023 issuance of the Class B shares, we would note that there were 43.9 million fully diluted Class A shares outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2023.The fourth quarter of 2023 was easily the Company's strongest financial quarter of the year. While U.S. metallurgical coal indices rose in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the prior two quarters, indices were still more than 10% below first quarter of 2023 levels. The Company's strong fourth quarter was due to the execution on its growth strategy. Specifically, in the second half of 2023 the Company shipped at a 4 million ton per annum run rate in both the third and fourth quarters, compared to a roughly 3 million ton per annum run rate in the first half of the year.During the fourth quarter, the Company repaid the final $10 million of debt related to the 2022 Ramaco Coal acquisition. Excluding amounts drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company reduced term debt by $55 million in 2023. The Company ended 2023 with $48 million of term debt outstanding, excluding the Revolving Credit Facility, and $42 million of cash. Lastly, the Company ended 2023 with a record level of liquidity of $91 million, compared to its $49 million at year-end 2022. MARKET COMMENTARY / 2024 OUTLOOK The Company reiterates all prior full-year 2024 guidance other than depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense, which can be seen in the ""Financial Guidance"" section of today's press release.As noted in its February 2024 market update, since early December the Company has committed an additional 1.9 million tons for sale into export markets in 2024 at index-linked pricing, bringing total current sales commitments for delivery in 2024 to 3.9 million tons. This consists of 1.5 million tons committed to North American customers at an average realized price of $167 per ton and an additional 2.4 million tons committed at mostly index-linked pricing for delivery to export customers. This would equate to 100% of sales at the low end of the Company's original 2024 production guidance of 3.9 million tons.In its February 2024 market update, based on this material increase to 2024 committed sales, the Company raised both its sales and production guidance. Today, the Company reiterates both its full year sales guidance of 4.2 - 4.6 million tons and production guidance of 4.0 - 4.4 million tons. The Company's pricing mix for 2024 would be approximately one-third domestic fixed price and two-thirds export index-linked business at the midpoint of sales guidance.Depending on continued market conditions, the Company believes that an annual sales run-rate above guidance may be achievable by year-end 2024. This would include sales of more than 0.5 million tons of both purchased coal and carryover inventory from 2023.Last month, the Company completed the purchase of an existing idled coal preparation plant which is being relocated to its Maben Complex in West Virginia. The purchase price of the plant was $3 million. This year the Company anticipates spending an additional $8 million in initial development capital expenditures related to the plant. We expect that the plant will be operational by the fourth quarter of 2024. This will materially reduce both overall trucking and mine cash costs at Maben where current production is trucked to Ramaco's Berwind preparation plant at a haul rate cost of over $40 per clean ton.The Company anticipates first quarter shipments of 800,000 – 950,000 tons of coal and expects an increasing cadence throughout 2024. Specifically, the first half of 2024 should see shipments around a 4 million ton per annum run rate, whereas the second half of 2024 should be closer to a 5 million ton per annum run rate. This second half increase will come from the addition of 0.4 million tons per annum at the Ram 3 surface and highwall mine at Elk Creek, as well as 0.3 million tons per annum from the third section at the Berwind mine. Overall mine costs are expected to decline as volumes are anticipated to increase sequentially each quarter throughout 2024.The Company has just entered into an agreement to both extend and increase the size of its existing Revolver facility with KeyBank, NA and a bank syndicate. The new facility will increase the Revolver from $125 million to $200 million with an accordion feature to increase the ultimate size by an additional amount of $75 million to $275 million. The term of the new facility will now be five years, increased from an original three years. The finalization of the new syndicated facility is expected to be completed early in the second quarter. The funding will be available for general corporate purposes.The Company expects that Weir International, Inc. will release its updated Exploration Target report on the Company's rare earth deposit in Wyoming, later this month. At that time the Company will both release a statement as well as hold a separate analyst and investor conference call regarding the findings.MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY Randall Atkins, Ramaco Resources' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer commented, ""Our fourth quarter results highlight the growth trajectory we have pursued. As we sit here today, we are essentially targeting over the coming years a doubling of the level of our 2023 production levels. This quarter's strong performance was despite a lack of strength in market pricing over the back half of the year. While U.S. metallurgical coal pricing indices indeed rose in the fourth quarter of 2023, they ended the year more than 10% below first quarter of 2023 levels. Our stronger fourth quarter was fundamentally due to a sales increase of shipping at a 4 million ton per annum run rate during the second half of the year as compared to a 3 million ton rate in the first half. We hope to increase this tempo in sales growth as we move into 2024. In early December, we announced 2 million tons of committed sales for 2024. Since then, we have almost doubled committed sales to 3.9 million tons. This level now stands at 100% of the low end of our original 2024 production guidance of 3.9 million tons. As a result of this material increase in committed sales, we recently raised both our 2024 sales and production guidance. Today, we anticipate 2024 sales of 4.2 - 4.6 million tons and production of 4.0 - 4.4 million tons. This year roughly two-thirds of our anticipated sales will be exported at index-linked pricing. We expect international prices will remain relatively strong throughout 2024, given that investment in new metallurgical coal supply remains fundamentally muted. Depending on continued market conditions we hope to end 2024 with sales exceeding guidance. In February, we completed the $3 million purchase of an existing coal preparation plant which will be relocated to our Maben Complex. We will spend another $8 million in initial development to move, relocate, reassemble and upgrade the plant, which should be operational by the fourth quarter of this year. Had we built a new comparable plant, the price was estimated at roughly $40 million. Once operational, the plant will meaningfully reduce both overall trucking and mine cash costs at Maben. Looking forward it also provides the optionality to have a preparation facility already in place to handle additional future production from a larger deep mine complex at Maben, should we elect to pursue such development in the future. 2023 was also a pivotal year for Ramaco in terms of its balance sheet management. Excluding amounts drawn on the Revolver, we reduced term debt by $55 million in 2023, ending the year with just $48 million of term debt outstanding, versus $42 million of cash. On a full year basis, we ended the year with less than half of the $102 million of term debt outstanding that we started the year with, excluding the Revolver. We also ended 2023 with a record amount of $91 million in liquidity, compared to $49 million at year-end 2022. Given our expected continued growth we expect to retire all debt outstanding in 2024 should we choose. Additionally, to provide greater levels of future liquidity for our growth plans, we have entered into an agreement with our main lender KeyBank, NA to increase the overall size of our Revolver to up to $275 million, with a new five-year extension of its term. We view this enhanced facility as both a validation of our creditworthiness and a meaningful strengthening of our liquidity. With respect to our Brook Mine rare earth element (""REE"") project, we expect to receive an updated independent Target Exploration report from Weir International this month. When this report is released we will provide our own commentary, as well as host a separate analyst call to discuss its conclusions and our path forward. In the interim, we have continued to work with our national lab partners at the National Energy Technology Laboratory to advance the potential commercial development of our deposit. In summary, these are exciting times and 2024 is a pivotal year ahead for Ramaco. We are hitting stride on several fronts at the same time. We are executing on our core growth strategy on the metallurgical coal side of the business, meaningfully reducing our debt, substantially growing our dividend, and making important advances on the commercial development of our Brook Mine REE project.""

FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2023 PERFORMANCE In the following paragraphs, all references to ""quarterly"" periods or to ""the quarter"" refer to the fourth quarter of 2023, unless specified otherwise. Year over Year Quarterly Comparison Overall production in the quarter was 745,000 tons, up 7% from the same period of 2022. The Elk Creek complex produced 412,000 tons, down 23% from 537,000 tons last year. This was in-line with the Company's plan to reduce its above normal inventory levels at Elk Creek. The Berwind, Knox Creek, and Maben complexes increased production to 333,000 tons in the quarter, up 111% from the same period last year. The main Berwind mine produced at a roughly 600,000 ton per annum run rate (adjusted for vacation periods) in the fourth quarter of 2023. Production and costs were positively impacted by economies of scale on the back of higher year-over-year tons produced and sold. This cost reduction came despite annual inflation rates running well above recent historical averages. Total quarterly sales were 988,000 tons, up 46% from 675,000 tons sold in the fourth quarter of 2022. This was the second straight quarter that the Company shipped at a 4 million ton per annum run rate. Quarterly pricing was $173 per ton on Company produced coal sold, which was 5% lower compared to $182 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2022. This mirrored the year-over-year decline in U.S. metallurgical coal price indices. Company produced cash mine costs were $107 per ton sold, excluding transportation costs, which was a 6% decrease from the same period in 2022. As a result of the lower realized prices, cash margins on Company produced coal were $66 per ton during the quarter, down from $68 per ton in the same period of 2022. This was based on non-GAAP revenue (FOB mine) and non-GAAP cash cost of sales (FOB mine). Quarter over Quarter Comparison Fourth quarter production was 745,000 tons, up 26,000 tons compared with the third quarter of 2023. The primary driver was the main Berwind mine ramping up production to a normal annualized run-rate of roughly 600,000 tons. Total quarterly sales volume of 988,000 tons was roughly comparable to the third quarter of 2023. Significantly, this was the second consecutive quarter where the Company both reduced inventory and shipped at a 4 million ton per annum run rate. The realized price of $173 per ton during the fourth quarter was up from $157 per ton in the third quarter 2023 reflecting stronger overall market conditions. On the back of stronger production, fourth quarter cash costs of $107 per ton on Company produced coal compared favorably to $114 per ton in the third quarter of 2023. Correspondingly, cash margins on Company produced coal were $66 per ton during the fourth quarter, increasing from $43 per ton in the third quarter, based on non-GAAP revenue (FOB mine) and non-GAAP cash cost of sales (FOB mine). BALANCE SHEET AND LIQUIDITY As of December 31, 2023, the Company had liquidity of $90.6 million, consisting of $42.0 million of cash plus $48.6 million of availability under our revolving credit facility. This was almost double the total liquidity of $49.1 million as of December 31, 2022. At year-end 2023, accounts receivable increased year over year by $55.7 million, reflective of the material increases in both overall and seaborne sales. Fourth quarter of 2023 capital expenditures totaled $18.0 million. This was down materially from $31.6 million in the same period of 2022, as the majority of capital expenditures for the Company's near-term growth projects had been incurred. The Company's effective quarterly tax rate was 23%. For the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recognized income tax expense of $8.8 million. The Company anticipates an overall tax rate of 20-25% in 2024.

We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to evaluate our operating performance more effectively. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus net interest expense; equity-based compensation; depreciation, depletion, and amortization expenses; income taxes; certain non-operating expenses (charitable contributions), and accretion of asset retirement obligations. Its most comparable GAAP measure is net income. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA is included below. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to serve as a substitute for GAAP measures of performance and may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies.

Non-GAAP cash cost per ton sold (FOB mine) is calculated as cash cost of coal sales less transportation costs and idle mine costs, divided by tons sold. We believe revenue per ton (FOB mine) and cash cost per ton (FOB mine) provide useful information to investors as these enable investors to compare revenue per ton and cash cost per ton for the Company against similar measures made by other publicly-traded coal companies and more effectively monitor changes in coal prices and costs from period to period excluding the impact of transportation costs, which are beyond our control. The adjustments made to arrive at these measures are significant in understanding and assessing the Company's financial performance. Revenue per ton sold (FOB mine) and cash cost per ton sold (FOB mine) are not measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be considered as a substitute for revenue and cost of sales under GAAP.

(TCPC) and BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation (BKCC) have received shareholder approval for their merger, with over 90% of shareholders voting in favor. Rajneesh Vig expressed gratitude for the strong support. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The approval of the merger between BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. and BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation represents a significant consolidation within the business development company sector. The overwhelming support from shareholders, with more than 90% in favor, indicates strong confidence in the synergies expected from this transaction. The merger could result in cost savings due to economies of scale, streamlined operations and potentially enhanced returns for investors due to a more diversified investment portfolio.From a financial perspective, the combined entity is likely to have a stronger balance sheet and improved access to capital markets. This could facilitate more competitive loan offerings and investments in higher-quality enterprises, thereby potentially improving the risk-return profile for shareholders. However, it's crucial to monitor the execution of the merger as integration risks can impact the anticipated benefits. Market Research Analyst Business development companies (BDCs) play a pivotal role in providing capital to small and medium-sized enterprises that may have limited access to traditional financing. The merger between TCPC and BCIC could impact the broader BDC market by setting a precedent for consolidation. It may trigger a wave of similar transactions as BDCs strive to achieve scale in a competitive market.The potential market impact extends beyond immediate stakeholders to the broader economy, as a larger, more efficient BDC could support a greater number of businesses, fostering innovation and job creation. Additionally, the merged entity's investment decisions could influence industry trends and capital allocation, which is significant given the strategic importance of BDCs in funding growth-stage companies. Legal Expert Mergers in the financial sector are subject to rigorous regulatory scrutiny to ensure compliance with securities laws and to protect the interests of investors. The successful shareholder vote is a key step, but the completion of the merger will still require adherence to various legal and regulatory requirements. It is essential to examine the legal structure of the merger to anticipate any potential regulatory challenges that may arise.Furthermore, the legal complexities of integrating two regulated investment companies involve considerations around contracts, fund management and fiduciary duties. The manner in which these legal aspects are managed can have a substantial impact on the success of the merger and the future operations of the combined entity. 03/07/2024 - 04:36 PM SANTA MONICA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BlackRock TCP Capital Corp.

"Hollysys Automation Technologies Reports Unaudited Financial Results for the Second Quarter and the First Half Year Ended December 31, 2023",2024-03-07T22:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,Hollysys Automation Technologies Reports Mixed Financial Results for First Half of Fiscal Year 2024,"Hollysys Automation Technologies Reports Unaudited Financial Results for the Second Quarter and the First Half Year Ended December 31, 2023 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Hollysys Automation Technologies Reports Mixed Financial Results for First Half of Fiscal Year 2024 Positive Total revenues increased by 2.1% to $423.6 million compared to the prior year. Gross margin decreased to 31.9% from 36.1% in the prior year. Net income attributable to Hollysys decreased by 34.3% to $45.8 million. Second quarter revenues decreased by 8.6% to $223.7 million compared to the prior year. Gross margin for the second quarter dropped to 29.5% from 39.6% in the prior year. Net income for the second quarter decreased by 70.7% to $14.1 million. Negative Decline in gross margin for both periods. Significant decrease in net income for both periods. Decrease in diluted earnings per share for both periods. Negative impact on cash flow from operating activities. Financial Analyst The reported decrease in net income by 34.3% for the first half and 70.7% for the second quarter, alongside the reduction in diluted earnings per share (EPS), is a significant concern for investors. These figures suggest that Hollysys is facing challenges in maintaining profitability, despite a slight increase in total revenues. The decline in gross margin from 36.1% to 31.9% in the first half and from 39.6% to 29.5% in the second quarter, indicates rising costs or pricing pressures, which could be attributed to various factors such as increased material costs, labor, or a shift in the sales mix towards lower-margin products or services.Furthermore, the consistency in inventory turnover days shows operational stability, but the increase in days sales outstanding (DSO) from 144 to 146 days in the first half and a more pronounced increase from 119 to 138 days in the second quarter, raises concerns about the company's cash flow and the efficiency of its collections process. This could impact the company's liquidity and its ability to reinvest in operations or pay down debt. Market Research Analyst Examining the broader market context, the performance of Hollysys should be compared against industry benchmarks and competitors. The decline in gross margin and net income might reflect sector-wide challenges or could be indicative of company-specific issues. If the latter, it could signal a loss of competitive advantage or operational inefficiencies that need to be addressed. The slight increase in revenues suggests that the company is still growing, albeit at a slow pace, which could be a positive sign if the company can manage to reverse the negative trends in profitability.Additionally, it is important to consider the economic conditions during the reported periods, such as inflation rates, supply chain disruptions and shifts in consumer demand, as these can have a substantial impact on a company's financial performance. A deeper analysis into the reasons behind these financial metrics would provide investors with a clearer picture of the company's health and its future prospects. 03/07/2024 - 05:00 PM First Half of Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Highlights Total revenues were $423.6 million, an increase of 2.1% compared to the comparable prior year period.Gross margin was 31.9%, compared to 36.1% for the comparable prior year period.

These non-GAAP financial measures serve as additional indicators of our operating performance and not as any replacement for other measures in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP measures help identify underlying trends in the Company's business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of the share-based compensation expenses, which are calculated based on the number of shares or options granted and the fair value as of the grant date, and amortization of acquired intangible assets. They will not result in any cash inflows or outflows. We believe that using non-GAAP measures help our shareholders to have a better understanding of our operating results and growth prospects. Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin of integrated solutions contracts, non-GAAP net income attributable to Hollysys Automation Technologies Ltd., as well as non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per share should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to gross profit and gross margin, gross profit and gross margin of integrated solutions contracts, net income attributable to Hollysys Automation Technologies Ltd., basic and diluted earnings per share, or any other measure of performance, or as an indicator of the Company's operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review the historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin of integrated solutions contracts, non-GAAP net income attributable to Hollysys Automation Technologies Ltd., as well as non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per share presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to the Company's data. The Company encourages investors and others to review the Company's financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. We define non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin as gross profit and gross margin, respectively, adjusted to exclude non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles. The following table provides a reconciliation of our gross profit and gross margin to non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin for the periods indicated.

The proceeds will fund the development of DeLamar towards a construction decision. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The closure of the royalty transaction between Integra Resources Corp. and Wheaton Precious Metals represents a strategic financial move for Integra, particularly in terms of capital allocation and project funding. The infusion of US$9.75 million in exchange for a 1.5% net smelter returns royalty on the DeLamar Project provides Integra with immediate liquidity, which is critical to support its ongoing developmental activities, including the Feasibility Study and the National Environmental Policy Act permitting process. This transaction is indicative of the company's ability to secure funding without diluting existing shareholders, a positive signal to the market. However, it is also important to consider the long-term cost of this capital, as the NSR means that Integra will yield a portion of its future revenues from the project to Wheaton, potentially impacting profitability once the project is operational. Mining Sector Analyst Integra's DeLamar Project, with its historical production and significant resource growth since acquisition, has reached a pivotal stage in its development lifecycle. The endorsement by Wheaton, a major player in the precious metals streaming and royalty space, not only provides a capital boost but also serves as a vote of confidence in the project's quality and the management team's capability. This transaction could potentially accelerate Integra's timeline towards a construction decision, which is a critical step in the transition from exploration to production. The market often reacts favorably to such advancements, as they reduce project risk and enhance the asset's value proposition. However, the royalty agreement does commit a portion of future revenues, which investors must weigh against the immediate benefits of capital infusion and project progression. Environmental Policy Analyst The progression of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) permitting process, as mentioned, is an essential factor for Integra's DeLamar Project, especially considering the stringent environmental regulations in the U.S. The successful completion of this process would be a significant milestone, as it would address investor concerns regarding environmental compliance and project viability. The capital from the royalty transaction earmarked for this purpose suggests that Integra is prioritizing regulatory adherence, which is crucial for the project's longevity and social license to operate. The NEPA process can often be lengthy and complex and its successful navigation could set a precedent for Integra's operational efficiency and risk management in the eyes of investors and stakeholders. 03/07/2024 - 05:00 PM TSXV: ITR; NYSE American: ITRGwww.integraresources.com VANCOUVER, BC, March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Integra Resources Corp.

The Crop Care segment stood out with a 26% revenue growth. Net profit decreased to $1.9 million, and Adjusted EBITDA dropped by 48% to $40.1 million. Despite market challenges, Lavoro maintains a positive outlook for FY2024. Positive None. Negative Gross profit decreased by 17% to $103.0 million in 2Q24. Net profit declined to $1.9 million in 2Q24, compared to $35.3 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 48% to $40.1 million in 2Q24. Lavoro's financial outlook for FY2024 remains unchanged, despite challenging market conditions. Financial Analyst The recent financial results of Lavoro Limited indicate a complex scenario where revenue growth is marginal at 1%, yet gross profit has significantly declined by 17% and net profit has seen a dramatic 95% decrease compared to the prior year. These figures suggest that while the company is managing to increase sales volume, it is doing so at the expense of profitability. This could raise concerns among investors regarding the company's pricing power and cost management strategies, especially considering the substantial input price deflation affecting the industry.Moreover, the contraction of gross margins by 360 basis points is a critical indicator of the pressure on the company’s core profitability. The unchanged financial outlook for FY2024 implies that management expects current market conditions to persist, which could potentially lead to further margin pressures. The stock market typically reacts to such mixed financials with increased volatility, as investors recalibrate their expectations based on the new data. Market Research Analyst The performance of Lavoro's Crop Care segment stands out positively amidst a generally negative report, with a significant 26% increase in revenue and a 21% increase in gross profit. This suggests that Lavoro's strategic focus on specialty fertilizers and its vertical integration with Ag retail are paying off. The segment's growth in gross profit, despite overall market headwinds, indicates a strong competitive position and successful product differentiation.Additionally, the company's efforts in expanding its technical sales representatives (RTVs) by 25% sequentially is a strategic move to bolster market share gains. This investment in human capital is expected to drive growth in the next fiscal year, which is a positive signal for long-term investors. However, the short-term impact on SG&A expenses due to this expansion, which has yet to contribute to sales, is a concern that needs to be monitored closely. Agricultural Economist The financial results reflect broader economic trends within the agricultural inputs market in Latin America. The significant input price deflation, particularly in crop protection and fertilizers, is indicative of a supply glut or reduced demand, possibly due to external factors such as weather patterns or changes in farming practices. Lavoro's report mentions the impact of El Niño on crop cycles and farmer purchasing decisions, which underscores the sensitivity of the sector to climatic variations.The mention of favorable weather conditions improving farmer sentiment and the strong start to the safrinha corn planting season could be a precursor to a more favorable market environment. However, the persistent disparities in retail inputs market across Brazil's regions suggest that the company's performance will be uneven and may depend heavily on regional market dynamics. This nuanced understanding of market conditions is essential for stakeholders making regional investment decisions. 03/07/2024 - 04:59 PM Lavoro’s revenue for 2Q24 reached $618.7 million*, marking a 1% increase compared to the prior year period, as volume growth led by market share gains helped to offset continued significant input price deflationary pressures in crop protection and fertilizers across various operating regions2Q24 gross profit stood at $103.0 million, reflecting a -17% decrease year-over-year, with gross margins contracting by -360 basis points to 16.7%, driven mainly by deflationary pressures affecting Ag retail distribution margins, partly mitigated by a more favorable segment mix, as Crop Care grew to represent 24% of Lavoro’s gross profit in 2Q24 (up from 16% in 2Q23)Crop Care segment emerged as a highlight this quarter, with revenue increasing 26% to $72.8 million, and gross profit expanding 21% to $25.7 million driven by strong growth in specialty fertilizersNet profit for 2Q24 was $1.9 million, compared to $35.3 million in the prior year period. This decline is attributed to a reduction in gross profit alongside increased SG&A and interest expensesAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $40.1 million, a -48% decrease from the previous year, mainly due to significant input price deflation. Adjusted net profit stood at $2.6 million, down from $37.4 million in the prior year.Lavoro’s financial outlook for FY2024 is unchanged relative to the projections provided last quarter SÃO PAULO, Brazil, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lavoro Limited (Nasdaq: LVRO, LVROW), the first U.S.-listed pure-play agricultural inputs retailer in Latin America, today announced its financial results for the fiscal second quarter of 2024, which ended on December 31, 2023. Ruy Cunha, CEO of Lavoro, commented, “Our second-quarter results underscore our resilience in the face of challenging market conditions not seen in our industry for well over a decade. Our model is intact, as demonstrated by the performance of our Brazil Ag Retail operations that produced yet another quarter of strong unit volume growth and market share gains, which offset the impact of the deflationary environment in crop protection and fertilizer inputs. Supporting these share gains is momentum in attracting seasoned technical sales representatives (RTVs) to the Lavoro organization, which is illustrated by 25% sequential growth in RTVs to just over 1,040 sales reps in Brazil. We are in a great position and anticipate the positive contribution of these new hires to help drive growth next fiscal year.” Mr. Cunha added, “Second quarter gross margins experienced sequential improvement, signaling the beginning of a path to recovery supported by stabilizing local input prices from the retail channel to farmers, and by the continued improvement in our average cost of goods sold, as we gradually cycle through our higher-cost inventory. Moreover, Crop Care’s performance in the quarter was a stand-out, with double-digit year-over-year growth in revenue and gross profit in spite of the market headwinds, and demonstrating yet again the synergies associated with the vertical integration with Lavoro Ag retail. “Our market outlook remains consistent with our late January assessment. We still foresee a 25% decrease in Brazil's retail inputs market for the 2023/2024 crop year, concluding in June 2024. Although price competition within the retail channel has broadly stabilized, disparities persist across Brazil's various regions, influenced by the ongoing destocking of excess agrochemical inventories. We are encouraged by the recent favorable weather conditions, which have contributed to an uptick in farmer sentiment, evidenced by the strong start to the safrinha corn planting season—currently at 71%, exceeding the five-year average of 52%."" * Financials presented in US dollars throughout this release are converted using the following average period USD/BRL exchange rate: 4.955 for 2Q24; 5.265 for 2Q23; the 1Q24 period was calculated using monthly exchange rates (4.801 for Jul-23, 4.904 for Aug-23, 4.937 for Sep-23); 1Q23 period was calculated (5.368 for Jul-22, 5.143 for Aug-22, 5.237 for Sep-22) FY2Q24 Financial Highlights Consolidated revenue for Lavoro in 2Q24 increased by 1% to $618.7 million, compared to the prior year period. Inputs revenue expanded 1% y/y to $610.8 million, as continued robust unit volume growth, contributions from recent M&A, and currency tailwinds, more than offset the input price deflationary environment.Brazil Ag Retail segment revenue grew by 1% to $528.7 million in 2Q24, reflecting market share gains, unit volume growth, and the impact from the acquisitions of Referencia and Coram, which collectively contributed 6% to 2Q24 segment revenue. Latam Ag Retail segment revenue fell by -2% to $55.8 million in the quarter, as the increase in fertilizer sales volumes and the favorable impact of the Colombian Peso’s strength were outweighed by a decrease in crop protection category revenues. Crop Care revenue increased 26% y/y to $72.8 million, led by the strong performance of specialty fertilizers and adjuvants product categories, which more than offset declines in biologicals.Consolidated gross profit decreased by -17% to $103.0 million in 2Q24, while gross margins contracted by -360 bps y/y to 16.7%. This reflects primarily lower distribution margins within our Brazil Ag Retail and Latam Ag Retail segments, higher freight costs as percentage of sales (an increase of 120 bps), and category mix-related headwinds in our Crop Care segment (with high margin biologicals underperforming in the quarter). Crucially, the year-over-year trends in consolidated gross margins saw a notable improvement sequentially, improving from a decline of -840 bps in the first quarter of 2024 to a decrease of -360 bps in the second quarter. This improvement stemmed primarily from the reduction in the average cost of goods sold, as higher-cost inventory purchased at the past elevated prices is gradually cycled through and replaced with inventory procured at current lower prices. Adjusted EBITDA decreased -48% y/y to $40.1 million in 2Q24, with Adjusted EBITDA margin contracting by -620 bps to 6.5%, reflecting the gross margin compression detailed above, along with a y/y increase in the SG&A (excluding D&A) as a percentage of sales, rising 300 bps to 11.3%. SG&A (excl. D&A) to sales increased due primarily to (i) higher personnel costs associated with newly hired RTVs that have yet to contribute to sales, and (ii) an increase in the allowance for expected credit losses.Adjustment items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA increased by $1.5 million to $2.4 million for 2Q24, due primarily to higher stock-based compensation expense (+0.5 million), and an increase in related-party consultancy services expenses in 2Q24 (+$0.9 million).Adjusted net profit in 2Q24 was $2.6 million, a decline of -$34.8 million over the prior year quarter, driven mainly by lower Adjusted EBITDA (-$37.4 million), higher financial costs (-$5.4 million) due to higher interest expense on trade payables, partially offset by a positive contribution from income tax (+11.0 million).

Notably, revenue in seeds products decreased by -11% y/y, negatively impacted by the shift in timing of farmers purchasing decisions, and a decrease in the mix of higher technology corn seed varieties due to El Niño. Recently acquired Referencia and Coram together contributed 6% to 2Q24 Brazil Ag Retail segment revenue.Gross margin contracted by -510 bps y/y to 13.9% in 2Q24, led by the impact of input price deflation across all product categories. Positively, gross margins saw a notable sequential improvement in y/y trends relative 1Q24, where gross margins had contracted by -1,070 bps. The sequential improvement was most pronounced in crop protection (a reduction of -260 bps y/y in 2Q24 vs. a reduction of -1,310 bps in 1Q24) and fertilizers (-280 bps in 2Q24 vs. -1,200 bps in 1Q24), as local input prices from the retail channel to farmers have stabilized, and as our average cost of goods sold continues to improve with the cycling of higher-cost inventory. Gross margins in seeds products sales declined sequentially (-430 bps y/y in 2Q24 vs. flat in 1Q24), due to the above-mentioned headwinds from mix.Adjusted EBITDA experienced a 58% decrease to $26.7 million in 2Q24, with Adjusted EBITDA margins reducing by -720 bps to 5.0%, attributable to gross margins headwinds, in addition to increased SG&A expenses due to a higher allowance for expected credit losses and elevated personnel costs stemming from the recent hiring of RTVs which have yet to impact sales.

These headwinds to revenue were partly offset by growth in sales of specialty product, seeds, and services, as well as the currency tailwind stemming from the appreciation of the Colombian Peso relative to the US Dollar and Brazilian Real.Segment gross profit was $9.9 million in 2Q24, a decrease of -14% y/y over the prior year period, while gross margins declining by -230 bps to 17.8% due primarily to the above-mentioned impact of pricing deflation to crop protection and fertilizer distribution margins.Adjusted EBITDA decreased -34% y/y to $4.7 million, and Adjusted EBITDA margins compressed by -410 bps to 8.4% due to the same drivers outlined above.

A non-IFRS financial measure is generally defined as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flow that purports to measure financial performance but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable IFRS measure. The Company believes these non-IFRS financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information as they are used by the Company's management to evaluate the Company's performance, and provide additional information about trends in our operating performance prior to considering the impact of capital structure, depreciation, amortization and taxation on our results, as well as the effects of certain items or events that vary widely among similar companies, and therefore may hamper comparability across periods, although these measures are not explicitly defined under IFRS. Management believes that these measures enhance a reader's understanding of the operating and financial performance of the Company and facilitate a better comparison between fiscal periods. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as profit (loss) for the year, adjusted for finance income (costs), net, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and excluding the impact of certain revenues, expenses and costs that we believe are isolated in nature incurred as part of our expansion, namely: (i) fair value on inventories sold from acquired companies, (ii) M&A adjustments that in management’s judgment do not necessarily occur on a regular basis, (iii) listing and other expenses recognized in connection with the Business Combination, (iv) share-based compensation expenses, (v) bonuses paid out to our employees as a result of the closing of the Business Combination, (vi) expenses paid to Patria in connection with management consultancy services, (vii) depreciation and amortization recognize on cost of goods sold and (viii) losses/gains on the fair value of commodity forward contracts. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue for the period/year. Adjusted Net Profit/Loss is defined as Net Profit/Loss excluding the impact of certain revenues, expenses and costs that we believe are isolated in nature incurred as part of our expansion, namely: (i) fair value on inventories sold from acquired companies, (ii) M&A adjustments that in management’s judgment do not necessarily occur on a regular basis, (iii) listing and other expenses recognized in connection with the Business Combination, (iv) share-based compensation expenses, (v) bonuses paid out to our employees as a result of the closing of the Business Combination, (vi) expenses paid to Patria in connection with management consultancy services, (vii) depreciation and amortization recognize on cost of goods sold and (viii) losses/gains on the fair value of commodity forward contracts. Adjusted Net Profit/Loss Margin is calculated as Adjusted Net Profit/Loss as a percentage of revenue for the period/year. The Company does not intend for the non-IFRS financial measures contained in this release to be a substitute for any IFRS financial information. Readers of this press release should use these non-IFRS financial measures only in conjunction with comparable IFRS financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-IFRS financial measures Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Profit/Loss and Adjusted Net Profit/Loss Margin, to their most comparable IFRS measures, are provided in the table below.

(REI) reported record operational and financial results for Q4 and FY 2023, with net income of $50.9M in Q4, $104.9M for FY, and Adjusted EBITDA of $236.0M. The company achieved a 47% increase in sales volumes and a 30% increase in Adjusted Free Cash Flow year-over-year. Ring Energy focused on reducing costs, debt reduction, and pursuing balance sheet enhancing acquisitions for 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from Ring Energy, Inc. demonstrate a robust performance in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023, with significant growth in sales volumes and a solid uptick in net income and EBITDA. The company's ability to grow its sales volumes by 47% year-over-year and achieve a record net income of $104.9 million for the full year suggests operational efficiency and effective capital management. The reduction in operating costs and the 30% increase in Adjusted Free Cash Flow indicate a strong operational framework that has positively impacted the bottom line.From a financial perspective, the debt reduction of $30 million since the Founders Acquisition and the maintenance of a leverage ratio of 1.62x are indicative of prudent financial stewardship. The company's liquidity position, with approximately $175 million available, provides flexibility for future capital expenditures or debt reduction strategies. Investors would view the Cash Return on Capital Employed (CROCE) of 17.2% as a positive indicator of the company's ability to generate returns above its capital costs. However, the decline in the realized price for all products and the net income drop compared to the previous year might raise concerns about pricing pressures and the sustainability of profit margins if commodity prices were to fluctuate. Market Research Analyst Ring Energy's operational achievements, including the successful drilling and completion of 31 wells, reflect a competitive edge in the exploration and production sector. The company's focus on high rate-of-return drilling and recompletion programs has evidently contributed to the substantial increase in production volumes. This strategic approach, combined with cost-reduction initiatives, has likely enhanced the company's market position and could attract investor attention.Furthermore, the company's guidance for maintaining or slightly growing oil production while reducing debt in 2024 suggests a cautious yet growth-oriented outlook. This is particularly relevant given the volatile nature of oil and gas prices, which can significantly impact revenue streams for energy companies. By hedging a portion of their production, Ring Energy is mitigating some of the risks associated with price volatility, which could reassure investors regarding the stability of future cash flows. Energy Sector Analyst Ring Energy's strategic acquisitions over the past 18 months and their integration into the company's operations are noteworthy, as they have contributed to the significant increase in sales volumes. The company's focus on accretive acquisitions that enhance the balance sheet is a testament to their long-term growth strategy. Additionally, the emphasis on maintaining a disciplined capital spending program aligns with industry best practices, particularly in the energy sector where capital discipline is crucial for sustaining profitability amidst fluctuating commodity prices.Ring Energy's reported proved reserves of 129.8 MMBoe and a PV-10 of $1.6 billion, using SEC pricing, underscore the company's substantial asset base. Proved developed reserves accounting for approximately 68% of total proved reserves indicate a strong reserve life and the potential for sustained production levels. The company's operational focus and financial guidance for 2024, including the pursuit of further accretive acquisitions and debt reduction, suggest a strategic approach to strengthening its market position and delivering shareholder value in the long term. 03/07/2024 - 04:54 PM THE WOODLANDS, Texas, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ring Energy, Inc.

Year-over-year, we achieved a 47% increase in sales volumes, a 21% increase in Adjusted EBITDA, and a 30% increase in Adjusted Free Cash Flow. Driving our results was the successful execution and integration of the two acquisitions made over the past 18 months, the success of our high rate-of-return drilling and recompletion programs, and our continuing focus on reducing costs. The hard work, dedication, and commitment of our workforce to our value focused, proven strategy delivered these outstanding results and we continue to believe staying the course will build near and long-term value for our stockholders. On behalf of our Board of Directors and management team, I would like to thank our employees for their efforts in making 2023 a very good year.’’ Mr. McKinney continued, “Our focus for 2024 will be very similar to the past. We will continue a disciplined capital spending program designed to organically maintain or slightly grow our oil production with the flexibility to respond as necessary to changing oil and natural gas prices. We intend to allocate our excess cash from operations to reducing debt and improving our balance sheet. We plan to continue seeking to grow through our pursuit of accretive, balance sheet enhancing acquisitions. These efforts should lead us to our ultimate goal, which is to further position our balance sheet and achieve the size and scale necessary to sustainably return meaningful capital to our stockholders. We believe our efforts in 2024 will make important strides towards achieving these goals. We also want to thank our stockholders for their trust and support as we pursue the opportunities and navigate the challenges the future may present.” Summary Results Q4 2023Q3 2023Q4 to Q3 2023 % ChangeQ4 2022Q4 YOY % ChangeFY 2023FY 2022FY % ChangeNet Sales (Boe/d) 19,397 17,509 11% 17,8569% 18,119 12,36447% Crude Oil (Bo/d) 13,637 12,028 13% 12,18912% 12,548 9,47932%Net Sales (MBoe) 1,784.5 1,610.9 11% 1,642.79% 6,613.3 4,512.647%Realized Price - All Products ($/Boe)$56.01$58.16 (4)%$60.69(8)%$54.60$76.95(29)%Revenues ($MM)$99.9$93.7 7%$99.7—%$361.1$347.24%Net Income/Loss ($MM)$50.9$(7.5)NM$14.5251%$104.9$138.6(24)%Adjusted Net Income ($MM)$21.2$26.3 (19)%$21.8(3)%$100.5$107.5(7)%Adjusted EBITDA ($MM)$65.4$58.6 12%$56.316%$236.0$195.221%Capital Expenditures ($MM)$38.8$42.4 (8)%$42.6(9)%$152.0$140.19%Adjusted Free Cash Flow ($MM)$16.3$6.1 165%$5.5197%$45.3$34.830% Financial Overview: For the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company reported net income of $50.9 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, which included a $32.5 million before tax non-cash unrealized commodity derivative gain, $2.5 million in before tax share-based compensation and $0.4 million in before tax transaction related costs for executed acquisitions and divestitures (“Transaction Costs”).

The average oil price differential the Company experienced from WTI NYMEX futures pricing in the fourth quarter of 2023 was a negative $0.92 per barrel of crude oil, while the average natural gas price differential from NYMEX futures pricing was a negative $3.12 per Mcf. Revenues were $99.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $93.7 million for the third quarter of 2023 and $99.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The 7% increase in fourth quarter 2023 revenues from the third quarter was driven by higher sales volumes partially offset by lower overall realized pricing. Lease Operating Expense (“LOE”): LOE, which includes expensed workovers and facilities maintenance, was $18.7 million, or $10.50 per Boe, in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus $18.0 million, or $11.18 per Boe, in the third quarter of 2023 and $17.4 million, or $10.60 per Boe, for the fourth quarter of 2022. Fourth quarter 2023 LOE came in at the low end of the Company’s guidance range of $10.50 to $11.00 per Boe and Ring remains focused on driving continued efficiencies throughout its operations. Gathering, Transportation and Processing (“GTP”) Costs: As previously disclosed, due to a contractual change effective May 1, 2022, the Company no longer maintains ownership and control of the majority of of its natural gas through processing. As a result, GTP costs are now reflected as a reduction to the natural gas sales price and not as an expense item. There remains only one contract in place with a natural gas processing entity where the point of control of gas dictates requiring the fees to be recorded as an expense. Ad Valorem Taxes: Ad valorem taxes were $0.92 per Boe for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $1.10 per Boe in the third quarter of 2023 and $0.96 per Boe for the fourth quarter of 2022. Production Taxes: Production taxes were $2.78 per Boe in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $2.95 per Boe in the third quarter of 2023 and $3.16 per Boe in fourth quarter of 2022. Production taxes ranged between 5.0% to 5.2% of revenue for all three periods. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (“DD&A”) and Asset Retirement Obligation Accretion: DD&A was $13.76 per Boe in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus $13.65 per Boe for the third quarter of 2023 and $12.71 per Boe in the fourth quarter of 2022. Asset retirement obligation accretion was $0.20 per Boe in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $0.22 per Boe for the third quarter of 2023 and fourth quarter of 2022. General and Administrative Expenses (“G&A”): G&A was $8.2 million ($4.58 per Boe) for the fourth quarter of 2023 versus $7.1 million ($4.40 per Boe) for the third quarter of 2023 and $8.3 million ($5.08 per Boe) in the fourth quarter of 2022. G&A, excluding share-based compensation1, was $5.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 ($3.20 per Boe) versus $4.9 million for the third quarter of 2023 ($3.05 per Boe) and $6.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 ($3.74 per Boe). The fourth quarter and third quarter of 2023 included Transaction Costs of $0.4 million and $(0.2) million, respectively. Adjusting for Transaction Costs, fourth quarter 2023 G&A, excluding share-based compensation, was $3.00 per Boe compared to $3.15 per Boe for the third quarter of 2023 — a 5% decrease. Interest Expense: Interest expense was $11.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus $11.4 million for the third quarter of 2023 and $9.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Derivative (Loss) Gain: In the fourth quarter of 2023, Ring recorded a net gain of $29.3 million on its commodity derivative contracts, including a realized $3.3 million cash commodity derivative loss and an unrealized $32.5 million non-cash commodity derivative gain. This compared to a net loss of $39.2 million in the third quarter of 2023, including a realized $5.4 million cash commodity derivative loss and an unrealized $33.9 million non-cash commodity derivative loss, and a net loss of $19.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, including a realized $13.9 million cash commodity derivative loss and an unrealized $5.4 million non-cash commodity derivative loss. A summary listing of the Company’s outstanding derivative positions at December 31, 2023 is included in the tables shown later in this release. A quarterly breakout is provided in the Company’s investor presentation. For full year 2024, the Company currently has approximately 2.1 million barrels of oil (45% of oil sales guidance midpoint) hedged and 2.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas (43% of natural gas sales guidance midpoint) hedged. Income Tax: The Company recorded a non-cash income tax provision of $7.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus a non-cash income tax benefit of $3.4 million in the third quarter of 2023 and a non-cash income tax provision of $2.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Balance Sheet and Liquidity: Total liquidity at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 was $174.5 million, a 2% increase from September 30, 2023 and a 7% decrease from December 31, 2022. Liquidity at December 31, 2023 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $0.3 million and $174.2 million of availability under Ring’s revolving credit facility, which includes a reduction of $0.8 million for letters of credit. On December 31, 2023, the Company had $425.0 million in borrowings outstanding on its revolving credit facility that has a current borrowing base of $600.0 million. Ring paid down $3 million of debt during the fourth quarter of 2023 and $30.0 million since the closing of the Founders Transaction. The Company is targeting further debt pay down during 2024 dependent on market conditions, the timing of capital spending and other considerations. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Ring successfully reaffirmed the Company’s borrowing base of $600 million under its revolving credit facility. The next regularly scheduled bank redetermination is scheduled to occur during May 2024. Ring is currently in compliance with all applicable covenants under its revolving credit facility. Capital Expenditures: During the fourth quarter of 2023, capital expenditures on an accrual basis were $38.8 million as compared to Ring’s previous guidance of $35 million to $40 million. The Company drilled four Hz wells (three in the CBP and one in NWS) and three vertical wells in the CBP and completed ten wells (six in the CBP and four in the NWS). Also included in fourth quarter 2023 capital spending were costs for capital workovers, infrastructure upgrades, and leasing costs. For the year ended December 31, 2023, capital expenditures on an accrual basis were $152.0 million, which included costs to drill, complete and place on production 20 Hz wells (14 in the NWS and six in the CBP) and 11 vertical wells in the CBP. Included in full year 2023 capital spending were costs for capital workovers, infrastructure upgrades, recompletions, and leasing costs. Ring also participated in the drilling and completion of five non-operated wells in the NWS and CBP.

Full Year 2023 Summary Financial Review The Company reported net income for full year 2023 of $104.9 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, and Adjusted Net Income of $100.5 million, or $0.51 per diluted share. For full year 2022, Ring reported net income of $138.6 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, and Adjusted Net Income of $107.5 million, or $0.76 per diluted share. In full year 2023, the Company grew Adjusted EBITDA by 21% to a record $236.0 million from $195.2 million in 2022. Ring generated record Adjusted Free Cash Flow for full year 2023 of $45.3 million versus $34.8 million in 2022 — a 30% increase. For full year 2023, the Company grew Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations by 14% to $197.0 million from $172.9 million in 2022. Revenues totaled $361.1 million for 2023 compared to $347.2 million in 2022, with the 4% increase driven by higher sales volumes partially offset by lower overall realized commodity prices. Net sales for full year 2023 were a record 18,119 Boe/d, or 6,613,321 Boe, comprised of 4,579,942 Bbls of oil, 6,339,158 Mcf of natural gas, and 976,852 Bbls of NGLs. Full year 2022 net sales averaged 12,364 Boe/d, or 4,512,610 Boe, which included 3,459,840 Bbls of oil, 4,088,642 Mcf of natural gas, and 371,329 Bbls of NGLs. The increase in sales volumes was a direct result of a full year of production from the Stronghold Acquisition that closed in August 2022 and partial year impact from the Founders Acquisition that closed in August 2023, as well as strong organic growth from the Company’s targeted capital spending program. For the full year 2023, the Company’s realized crude oil sales price was $76.21 per barrel, the natural gas sales price was $0.05 per Mcf, and the NGLs sales price was $11.95 per barrel. The combined average sales price for full year 2023 was $54.60 per Boe compared to $76.95 per Boe for full year 2022. For the full year 2023, LOE was $70.2 million, or $10.61 per Boe, versus $47.7 million, or $10.57 per Boe, for full year 2022. The increase in LOE on an absolute basis was primarily associated with a 47% increase in production, as well as increased costs for goods and services due to higher activity levels. For the full year 2023, G&A was $29.2 million, or $4.41 per Boe, compared to $27.1 million, or $6.00 per Boe for full year 2022. G&A, excluding share-based compensation, was $20.4 million, or $3.08 per Boe, compared to $19.9 million, or $4.42 per Boe for full year 2022. Excluding Transaction Costs, full year 2023 G&A, net of share-based compensation, was $3.01 per Boe — a 24% decrease from full year 2022. 2024 Capital Investment, Sales Volumes, and Operating Expense Guidance In January, the Company commenced its 2024 development program that includes two rigs (one horizontal and one vertical) and is focused on slightly growing oil volumes while maintaining year-over-year overall production levels. The Company is utilizing a phased (versus continuous) capital drilling program in order to maximize free cash flow. For full year 2024, Ring expects total capital spending of $135 million to $175 million that includes a balanced and capital efficient combination of drilling, completing and placing on production 18 to 24 Hz and 20 to 30 vertical wells across the Company’s asset portfolio. Additionally, the full year capital spending program includes funds for targeted well recompletions, capital workovers, infrastructure upgrades, reactivations, and leasing costs, as well as non-operated drilling, completion, and capital workovers. All projects and estimates are based on assumed WTI oil prices of $70 to $90 per barrel and Henry Hub prices of $2.00 to $3.00 per Mcf. As in the past, Ring has designed its spending program with flexibility to respond to changes in commodity prices and other market conditions as appropriate. Based on the $155 million mid-point of spending guidance, the Company expects the following estimated allocation of capital investment, including: 73% for drilling, completion, and related infrastructure;24% for recompletions and capital workovers; and3% for land, environmental and emission reducing upgrades, and non-operated capital. The Company remains focused on continuing to generate Adjusted Free Cash Flow. All 2024 planned capital expenditures will be fully funded by cash on hand and cash from operations, and excess Adjusted Free Cash Flow is currently targeted for further debt reduction. The Company currently forecasts full year 2024 oil sales volumes of 12,600 to 13,300 Bo/d compared with full year 2023 oil sales volumes of 12,548 Bo/d, with the mid-point of guidance reflecting a 3% increase. The guidance in the table below represents the Company's current good faith estimate of the range of likely future results for the first quarter and full year of 2024. Guidance could be affected by the factors discussed below in the ""Safe Harbor Statement"" section.

Also included is anticipated spending for leasing costs, and non-operated drilling, completion, and capital workovers. Year-End 2023 Proved Reserves The Company's year-end 2023 SEC proved reserves were 129.8 MMBoe compared to 138.1 MMBoe at year-end 2022. During 2023, Ring recorded reserve additions of 8.2 MMBoe for acquisitions and 4.8 MMBoe for extensions, discoveries and improved recovery. Offsetting these additions were 5.7 MMBoe related to the sale of non-core assets, 6.6 MMBoe of production, 5.3 MMBoe for reductions in year-over-year pricing, and 3.7 MMBoe related to changes in performance and other economic factors. The SEC twelve-month first day of the month average prices used for year-end 2023 were $74.70 per barrel of crude oil and $2.637 per MMBtu of natural gas, both before adjustment for quality, transportation, fees, energy content, and regional price differentials, while for year-end 2022 they were $90.15 per barrel of crude oil and $6.358 per MMBtu of natural gas. Year-end 2023 SEC proved reserves were comprised of approximately 63% crude oil, 19% natural gas, and 18% natural gas liquids. At year end, approximately 68% of 2023 proved reserves were classified as proved developed and 32% as proved undeveloped. This is compared to year-end 2022 when approximately 65% of proved reserves were classified as proved developed and 35% were classified as proved undeveloped. The PV-10 value at year-end 2023 was $1,647.0 million versus $2,773.7 million at the end of 2022.

This is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC and is derived from the Standardized Measure of Discounted Futures Net Cash Flows, which is the most directly comparable generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) measure. In accordance with guidelines established by the SEC, estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2023 were determined to be economically producible under existing economic conditions, which requires the use of the 12-month average commodity price for each product, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the year ended December 31, 2023. The SEC average prices used for year-end 2023 were $74.70 per barrel of crude oil (WTI) and $2.637 per MMBtu of natural gas (Henry Hub), both before adjustment for quality, transportation, fees, energy content, and regional price differentials. Such prices were held constant throughout the estimated lives of the reserves. Future production and development costs are based on year-end costs with no escalations. Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Ring’s standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and natural gas reserves and changes in the standardized measure as described below were prepared in accordance with GAAP. As of December 31, 2023 2022 Future cash inflows $6,622,410,752 $9,871,961,000 Future production costs (2,413,303,488) (2,751,896,250)Future development costs (1) (562,063,424) (647,196,750)Future income taxes (548,664,988) (1,142,147,641)Future net cash flows 3,098,378,852 5,330,720,359 10% annual discount for estimated timing of cash flows (1,699,193,661) (3,058,606,841) Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows $1,399,185,191 $2,272,113,518 (1) Future development costs include not only development costs but also future asset retirement costs. Reconciliation of PV-10 to Standardized Measure PV-10 is derived from the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows (“Standardized Measure”), which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for proved reserves calculated using SEC pricing. PV-10 is a computation of the Standardized Measure on a pre-tax basis. PV-10 is equal to the Standardized Measure at the applicable date, before deducting future income taxes, discounted at 10 percent. We believe that the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated net proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes, and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties. Further, investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies without regard to the specific tax characteristics of such entities. Moreover, GAAP does not provide a measure of estimated future net cash flows for reserves other than proved reserves or for reserves calculated using prices other than SEC prices. We use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas properties. PV-10, however, is not a substitute for the Standardized Measure. Our PV-10 measure and the Standardized Measure do not purport to represent the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves.

RING ENERGY, INC. Non-GAAP Information Certain financial information included in this release are not measures of financial performance recognized by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures are “Adjusted Net Income”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, “Adjusted Free Cash Flow” or “AFCF,” “Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations” or “ACFFO,” “G&A Excluding Share-Based Compensation,” “G&A Excluding Share-Based Compensation and Transaction Costs,” “Leverage Ratio,” “Current Ratio,” “Cash Return on Capital Employed” or “CROCE,” and “All-In Cash Operating Costs.” Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of performance. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric used to determine certain of the Company’s incentive compensation awards. These disclosures may not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures which may be reported by other companies. Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted Net Income “Adjusted Net Income” is calculated as net income (loss) minus the estimated after-tax impact of share-based compensation, ceiling test impairment, unrealized gains and losses on changes in the fair value of derivatives, and related transaction costs. Adjusted Net Income is presented because the timing and amount of these items cannot be reasonably estimated and affect the comparability of operating results from period to period, and current period to prior periods. The Company believes that the presentation of Adjusted Net Income provides useful information to investors as it is one of the metrics management uses to assess the Company’s ongoing operating and financial performance, and also is a useful metric for investors to compare our results with our peers.

Company management believes Adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful because it helps investors understand Ring’s operating performance and makes it easier to compare its results with those of other companies that have different financing, capital and tax structures. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for net income, as an indication of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity.

For this purpose, our definition of capital expenditures includes costs incurred related to oil and natural gas properties (such as drilling and infrastructure costs and lease maintenance costs) but excludes acquisition costs of oil and gas properties from third parties that are not included in our capital expenditures guidance provided to investors. Our management believes that Adjusted Free Cash Flow is an important financial performance measure for use in evaluating the performance and efficiency of our current operating activities after the impact of accrued capital expenditures and net interest expense and without being impacted by items such as changes associated with working capital, which can vary substantially from one period to another. Other companies may use different definitions of Adjusted Free Cash Flow.

Market Research Analyst The contract awarded to Willdan Group by a New England utility is a substantial development for the company, potentially adding significant revenue over the next three years.

Financial Analyst Investors will be interested in the potential impact of the new contract on Willdan's revenue streams and earnings per share (EPS).

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Essential Properties Realty Trust's quarterly cash dividend of $0.285 per share translates into an annualized rate of $1.14. This declaration is a critical indicator of the company's financial health and its commitment to returning value to shareholders. Dividends are often a sign of a company's stable earnings and cash flow, which can be particularly attractive to income-focused investors. An increase or maintenance of dividend levels can signal confidence by the board in the company's future earnings potential.However, it is important to consider the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the price per share. The yield provides a measure of the income generated by an investment in the company's stock relative to its price. A higher yield can make the stock more attractive to investors, potentially influencing the stock price positively. Conversely, if the yield is low compared to industry peers, it may suggest a valuation that is not as competitive. Market Research Analyst When evaluating the impact of dividend announcements on the stock market, one must consider the broader economic context. Market conditions, interest rates and investor sentiment towards real estate investment trusts (REITs) like Essential Properties can influence the stock's performance post-dividend declaration. In a low-interest-rate environment, REITs tend to perform well as investors seek yield; however, in a rising interest rate environment, the cost of capital increases, which can put pressure on REITs.Moreover, the sustainability of dividends is paramount. It hinges on the company's ability to generate sufficient rental income, maintain occupancy rates and manage expenses effectively. Investors often scrutinize the payout ratio—the percentage of earnings paid out as dividends—to assess whether the dividend is sustainable in the long run without compromising the company's growth prospects. Real Estate Investment Trust Analyst As a REIT, Essential Properties is required by law to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends. This regulatory framework makes the analysis of dividend announcements particularly significant for REITs. The company's ability to maintain or grow its dividend is closely tied to its operational performance, including the quality of its property portfolio, the creditworthiness of its tenants and its lease structures.Investors should also consider the company's funds from operations (FFO), a key metric for REITs that adds depreciation and amortization to earnings, excluding gains on sales of property. This measure is often considered a more accurate reflection of a REIT's operating performance than traditional earnings metrics. A stable or increasing FFO can provide reassurance that the dividend is backed by solid operational results. 03/07/2024 - 04:42 PM PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Essential Properties Realty Trust, Inc.

(BHLB) declares a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per common share, reinforcing shareholder value. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per common share by Berkshire Hills Bancorp represents a distribution of profits back to shareholders, which is a direct indicator of the company's current financial health and its ability to generate cash. This decision is typically seen as a positive signal to the market, suggesting that the management is confident in the company's steady cash flow and profitability. Shareholders often view regular dividends as a sign of a mature and stable company and it can affect the stock's attractiveness, particularly to income-focused investors.However, the size and sustainability of the dividend in comparison to the company's earnings and payout ratio are critical. If the dividend payout ratio is too high, it might indicate that the company is not reinvesting enough back into the business for future growth. Conversely, a low payout ratio could suggest that the company is retaining earnings for expansion and operational improvements. Investors will often compare the dividend yield to those of other companies in the financial sector to assess relative value. Market Research Analyst The announcement of the dividend payment can also be reflective of the company's strategic positioning within the broader financial sector. A consistent dividend payment might indicate that Berkshire Hills Bancorp is aiming to maintain a shareholder-friendly capital allocation policy. This can be especially relevant in the banking industry, where investors may be cautious due to economic cycles and regulatory changes affecting profitability.Analyzing the company's historical dividend trends can provide insights into its long-term financial strategy. For instance, if the dividend has been growing, remaining stable, or if there have been cuts in the past. These trends can influence investor sentiment and expectations about future earnings and company performance. Additionally, the timing of the dividend in relation to economic conditions or market volatility can further impact investor perception and the company's stock price. 03/07/2024 - 04:30 PM BOSTON, March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc.

Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2023 Results; Provides Fiscal 2024 Outlook Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Gap Inc. (GPS) reports strong fourth-quarter financial results with increased net sales, market share gains, and operating margin expansion. The company ended the fiscal year with a healthy cash balance, showcasing financial and operational rigor. Positive Increased net sales of $4.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 1% compared to last year. Market share gains and improved trends at Old Navy and Gap contributed to the strong performance. Operating margin expansion of 530 basis points to 5.0% in the fourth quarter. Full-year operating cash flow of $1.5 billion and cash balance of $1.9 billion at the end of the fiscal year. Fourth quarter results benefited from the addition of the 53rd week, contributing to growth. Net income of $185 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.49 in the fourth quarter. Gap Inc. President and CEO, Richard Dickson, highlights the company's focus on reinvigorating brands for profitable growth. The effective tax rate of 15.1% benefited from the release of certain tax reserves. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in fourth quarter net sales and operating margin expansion by Gap Inc. suggests a strategic pivot towards financial stability and operational efficiency. The positive shift in gross margin, driven by a significant 500 basis points increase in merchandise margin, indicates a more profitable mix of sales, likely due to improved inventory management and cost control measures. This is further supported by a 30 basis points leverage in ROD expenses, which reflects a more efficient use of retail space and potentially successful negotiations for better lease terms or the closure of underperforming stores.The operating cash flow of $1.5 billion and a strong cash balance of $1.9 billion provides the company with a solid liquidity position to navigate market uncertainties and invest in growth opportunities. The effective tax rate benefit implies strategic tax planning, which may include the utilization of carryforward losses or favorable changes in tax legislation. However, the decline in online sales juxtaposed with an increase in store sales could signal a shift in consumer behavior or possibly saturation in the e-commerce segment for apparel retail, which could have long-term implications for the company's online strategy. Market Research Analyst Gap Inc.'s performance must be contextualized within the broader apparel industry, which has been experiencing a post-pandemic shift in consumer spending patterns. The flat comparable sales indicate that while Gap Inc. is holding onto its customer base, significant growth in market share may be challenging without innovative strategies to attract new customers or increase purchase frequency among existing ones. The 4% increase in store sales suggests a return to in-person shopping experiences, a trend that retailers must capitalize on to enhance brand loyalty and customer engagement.The company's mention of market share gains is noteworthy; however, without specific figures, the actual impact on the competitive landscape is unclear. Investors should consider the potential for Gap Inc. to leverage its brand portfolio to differentiate and capture diverse market segments, from value-oriented consumers at Old Navy to the more premium segments targeted by Banana Republic and Athleta. Retail Industry Expert The mention of operational rigor by Gap Inc.'s CEO indicates a strategic focus on cost management and operational efficiency. This is crucial in the retail sector, where margins are often thin and competition is intense. The company's ability to expand its operating margin in a challenging retail environment is a positive sign of its operational capabilities and strategic focus on profitability.Furthermore, the impact of the 53rd week in the fiscal calendar is an important consideration. This additional week can skew year-over-year comparisons and investors should take this into account when evaluating the company's performance. The fact that Gap Inc. has adjusted its comparable sales calculations to exclude this week demonstrates transparency and aids in providing a clearer picture of the company's organic growth trajectory. 03/07/2024 - 04:15 PM Fourth Quarter Net Sales Increased with Market Share Gains Fourth Quarter Operating Margin Expansion Reflects Continued Financial and Operational Rigor Full Year Operating Cash Flow of $1.5 Billion; Ended Fiscal Year with Cash Balance of $1.9 Billion SAN FRANCISCO, March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Gap Inc.

We use this metric internally, as we believe our sustained ability to generate free cash flow is an important driver of value creation.

(SDPI) announces acquisition by Drilling Tools International Corp. for approximately $32.2 million. The deal offers SDPI shareholders $1.00 in cash or 0.313 shares of DTI stock per SDPI share. The transaction aims to enhance growth, expand market reach, and provide opportunities for employees. Positive The acquisition deal with Drilling Tools International Corp. is valued at around $32.2 million. SDPI shareholders have the option to receive $1.00 in cash or 0.313 shares of DTI stock per SDPI share. The merger with DTI is expected to drive more value for shareholders and stakeholders by combining patented technology and manufacturing capabilities with DTI's sales and marketing strength. The deal is set to close in the third quarter of 2024, offering expanded opportunities for employees and enhancing growth prospects. Fourth-quarter 2023 revenue review shows a decline in North America revenue related to tool sales, impacted by lower drilling rig activity. International revenue grew by 9% in the fourth quarter as the Company expands operations in the Middle East market. Operating results for the fourth quarter indicate a net loss of $273,000, with adjusted EBITDA declining by 44% compared to the previous quarter. Full-year 2023 review highlights a 9.8% increase in total revenue, with operating income decreasing by 8.2%. SG&A expenses increased by 32% in 2023, mainly due to international expansion and legal expenses related to patent infringement lawsuits. Net income for 2023 included a $6.4 million release of deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Cash generated by operations in 2023 was $3.2 million, with cash balance at year-end reaching $2.7 million. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of Superior Drilling Products, Inc. (SDP) by Drilling Tools International Corp. (DTI) for approximately $32.2 million is a significant transaction within the drilling tool technology sector. The valuation and payment structure, offering SDP shareholders a choice between cash and stock, reflect a strategic move to align interests and potentially offer upside through DTI's stock performance. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024, indicating a future integration phase that could yield synergies and enhanced market positioning.SDP's financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 show a mixed performance with a year-over-year revenue decrease of 18.7% for the quarter yet a full-year revenue increase of 9.8%. The significant net income for the fourth quarter, primarily due to the release of a $6.4 million deferred tax asset valuation allowance, skews the profitability picture and is not indicative of operational performance. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure that provides a clearer view of operating profitability, declined both quarterly and annually. This suggests operational challenges, potentially justifying the acquisition as a strategic move to strengthen the company's market position and financial health. Market Research Analyst The decline in North American revenue for SDP can be attributed to lower drilling rig activity and the timing of orders, which is a concern given North America's contribution of approximately 85% to total revenue. However, international growth, particularly in the Middle East, is a positive indicator of the company's successful international expansion strategy. The increase in international rig count and the 41% growth in international revenue for the full year underscore the potential for further international market penetration.Looking at the industry, the decline in North American rig count and the associated impact on demand for SDP's services need to be monitored closely as they could indicate broader market trends. The capital expenditures in the Middle East and the opening of a new service and technology center suggest a strategic pivot towards emerging markets, which could be a key growth driver in the face of North American market volatility. Legal Expert The definitive agreement for DTI's acquisition of SDP will involve complex legal considerations, particularly regarding the mechanics of the share conversion and cash consideration. The election, proration and adjustment mechanics as outlined in the agreement will require careful navigation to ensure equitable treatment of shareholders. Furthermore, the increase in SG&A expenses due to legal fees associated with international expansion and ongoing patent infringement litigation highlights the legal complexities inherent in global operations and intellectual property protection within the drilling technology sector.It is also notable that the transaction's closing is contingent upon customary closing conditions, which may include regulatory approvals and shareholder consent. The legal framework of the acquisition, once completed, will have implications for corporate governance, compliance and the integration of operations across different jurisdictions. 03/07/2024 - 04:15 PM Entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Drilling Tools International Corp. VERNAL, Utah--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Superior Drilling Products, Inc. (NYSE American: SDPI) (“SDP” or the “Company”), a designer and manufacturer of drilling tool technologies, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.

Revenue in North America, while up 6%, was constrained by the declining rig count and reduced tools sales in the fourth quarter. International revenue growth was 41%, demonstrating the Company’s successful execution of its international strategy, improved staffing within its ME operations, and the increasing rig counts in the ME region. Full year SG&A expenses increased 32% to $9.6 million largely due to the Company’s international expansion. Included in the full year 2023 SG&A were $1.2 million of legal expenses due to continuing litigation for the Company’s patent infringement lawsuit. This compared with $600 thousand of similar legal expenses in the prior-year period. The Company also incurred $204 thousand in fees as part of its strategic review process in 2023. Net income for 2023 included the $6.4 million valuation allowance release during the fourth quarter.

Wayne Prejean, CEO of DTI, stated, ""After initial review, we are providing preliminary estimates of our 2023 full year results as follows: Preliminary Estimates for 2023 Full Year Results (Unaudited) Estimated Revenue $150 MM – $154 MM Estimated Net Income $14.6 MM – $14.9 MM Estimated Adjusted EBITDA(1) $50 MM – $52 MM Estimated Adjusted EBITDA Margin(1) 33% – 34% Estimated Adjusted Free Cash Flow(1)(2) $7 MM – $8 MM (1) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures.

(2) Adjusted Free Cash Flow defined as Adjusted EBITDA less Gross Capital Expenditures ""We are delighted to report that after only eight months as a public company, we are delivering on the strategic plans that we outlined during our public offering. We are also pleased to tighten and update the ranges for our estimated 2023 results that fall within our prior guidance expectations,"" Prejean continued. ""As a market leader providing downhole tool rentals for both North American land and Gulf of Mexico deepwater drilling operations, DTI's extensive rental model, broad distribution capabilities and diverse customer base across multiple basins provides us with a significant competitive advantage, especially during volatile commodity price cycles. In contrast to the larger capital-intensive equipment companies in the oilfield services sector, our rental tools are easily deployable to various locations to serve our clients' needs. We believe the ability to scale our operations as needed across our extensive footprint allows us to better support customers in the field, and, with over 65,000 rental tools in our fleet, we are well positioned to support our customers' activity. ""Additionally, we have established an M&A framework and robust M&A pipeline that will allow us to selectively consolidate the oilfield service rental tool industry. Our pending acquisition of Superior Drilling Products, Inc. (NYSE American: SDPI) is an outstanding example of how we are expanding DTI's growth opportunities, both domestically and internationally, with a particular focus on our presence in the Middle East. We are confident that this and future acquisitions will drive innovation, enhance our product offerings, and, as a result, increase shareholder value.

The information presented herein should not be considered a substitute for full unaudited financial statements for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, or audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, once they become available and should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or its management as to its actual financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. The ranges for the preliminary estimated financial results described above constitute forward-looking statements. The preliminary estimated financial information presented herein is subject to change, and the Company's actual financial results may differ from such preliminary estimates and such differences could be material. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance upon these preliminary estimates. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This release includes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow measures. Each of the metrics are ""non-GAAP financial measures"" as defined in Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net earnings or cash flows as determined by GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted for (i) goodwill and/or long-lived asset impairment charges, (ii) stock-based compensation expense, (iii) restructuring charges, (iv) transaction and integration costs related to acquisitions and (v) other expenses or charges to exclude certain items that we believe are not reflective of ongoing performance of our business. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to supplement the GAAP measures in order to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure, and we define Adjusted Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less Gross Capital Expenditures. We use Adjusted Free Cash Flow as a financial performance measure used for planning, forecasting, and evaluating our performance. We believe that Adjusted Free Cash Flow is useful to enable investors and others to perform comparisons of current and historical performance of the Company. As a performance measure, rather than a liquidity measure, the most closely comparable GAAP measure is net income (loss). The following tables present a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the periods indicated: Drilling Tools International Corp.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of Pangiam by BigBear.ai represents a strategic move to enhance the company's offerings in AI-powered decision intelligence solutions. The all-stock nature of the transaction suggests confidence in the long-term value proposition of the combined entity. The exercise of warrants contributing approximately $54 million of cash proceeds is a positive development for liquidity and balance sheet strength. However, a net loss of $21.3 million, despite being an improvement from the previous year, indicates that the company is still in a phase of investment and growth.From a financial perspective, the second consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA at $3.7 million and the cash flow positivity in the second half of 2023 signal operational efficiency and potential for sustainable profitability. The provided revenue outlook for 2024, ranging from $195 to $215 million, offers investors a measure of the company's growth expectations and can be used to gauge future performance against market expectations. Market Research Analyst BigBear.ai's acquisition of Pangiam and the integration of advanced biometrics and computer vision capabilities could position the company favorably within the AI sector, which is experiencing rapid growth. The emphasis on facial recognition and image-based anomaly detection aligns with increasing demand for security and data analysis solutions across various industries. This strategic positioning might open new market opportunities and customer segments for BigBear.ai.It is also important to consider the competitive landscape and the rate of innovation within the AI industry. The company's ability to capitalize on its enhanced capabilities and to differentiate itself from competitors will be critical for capturing market share and driving revenue growth as indicated in their 2024 outlook. Technology Analyst The integration of Pangiam's technology with BigBear.ai's existing computer vision capabilities could lead to the development of more robust AI solutions. The combined expertise in facial recognition, anomaly detection and biometrics represents an advancement in decision intelligence technology. The focus on these technologies is timely, as they are becoming increasingly important in sectors such as security, defense and logistics.Understanding the technical synergies and the potential for innovation post-acquisition is crucial. The ability of BigBear.ai to effectively integrate and leverage Pangiam's technology will be a determinant of the company's future success and its impact on the market. The technical advancements should be monitored for their potential to disrupt existing market dynamics and create new standards within AI applications. 03/07/2024 - 04:15 PM Announced successful close of Pangiam acquisition in an all-stock transaction, combining facial recognition, image-based anomaly detection and advanced biometrics with BigBear.ai’s computer vision capabilities.

COLUMBIA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: BBAI) (“BigBear.ai” or the “Company”), a leader in AI-powered decision intelligence solutions, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, released 2024 revenue guidance and issued an investor letter that has been posted to the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website. BigBear.ai CEO Mandy Long said, “As we close out FY 2023, I am proud of the work that we have done as a company to solidify BigBear.ai’s foundation. We entered the year in a different position than many other companies that are playing a role in the transformative potential of artificial intelligence. After joining in October 2022, I spoke openly about needing a foundational year to overhaul our operating structure, wind down contracts that did not meet our business objectives, reset the strategic priorities of BigBear.ai, and manage uncertainty in a volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. In short, we had to do the hard work to get our house in order.​ We stand here in early 2024 knowing that we did what we said we would do. With the completion of the Pangiam acquisition and incremental cash proceeds of $54M from warrants exercised in Q1 2024, we are well positioned for healthy growth in the year ahead.” Kevin McAleenan, former CEO of Pangiam, has been announced as President, and will play a critical role in leading the business combination. “Together, we will be able to deliver broader capabilities and more value to our customers and partners. The combined company is positioned to be a breakout leader, with both a proven track record of innovating in our target markets and developing cutting-edge products. We couldn’t be more excited about the future.” Financial Highlights Revenue grew 0.5% to $40.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $40.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross margin of 32.1% in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase from 29.2% in the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by improved Federal margins on our largest fixed price contracts coupled with mixing out of lower margin work such as EPASS that completed in July 2023. Net loss of $21.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, which includes $9.4 million of non-cash expense related to the change in the fair value of warrants that were issued in 2023, and $6.1 million of equity-based compensation expense, compared to a net loss of $29.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, which included $18.3 million of non-cash goodwill impairment charges and $2.6 million of restructuring charges. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA* of $3.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $(2.5) million for the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily driven by gross margin improvement and continued focus on operating expense reductions. SG&A of $18.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $15.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily driven by an increase in equity-based compensation. Recurring SG&A* has been reduced from $16.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 to $12.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, a net improvement of $3.8 million. Ending cash balance of $32.6 million as of December 31, 2023 compared to $12.6 million as of December 31, 2022. New Developments BigBear.ai announced a successful close of its acquisition of Pangiam Intermediate Holdings, LLC (Pangiam), a leader in Vision AI for the global trade, travel, and digital identity industries. This strategic move, finalized on February 29, 2024, accelerates and evolves BigBear.ai’s mission to create clarity for the world’s most complex decisions in three markets: national security, supply chain management, and digital identity.

(2) The increase in fair value of derivatives during the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily relates to changes in the fair value of PIPE and RDO warrants issued during the first and second quarters of 2023. The (decrease) increase in fair value of derivatives during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 primarily relate to the Forward Share Purchase Agreements that were entered into prior to the closing of our business combination on December 7, 2021 (the “Business Combination”) and were fully settled during the first quarter of 2022, as well as the change in the fair value of private warrants. (3) In the third and fourth quarters of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023, the Company incurred employee separation costs associated with a strategic review of the Company’s capacity and future projections to better align the organization and cost structure and improve the affordability of its products and services.

During the first quarter of 2023, the Company reevaluated its operating and reportable segments following an organizational and legal entity restructuring, which allowed the Company to align its operations with how the business will be managed. As a result of this reevaluation, effective for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company determined it that it manages its operations as a single operating and reportable segment. (8) Non-recurring internal integration costs related to the Business Combination.

Some of the financial information and data contained in this press release, such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Recurring SG&A have not been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). To supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP in our press release, we also report certain non-GAAP financial measures. A “non-GAAP financial measure” refers to a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in such company’s financial statements. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the relevant GAAP measures and should be read in conjunction with information presented on a GAAP basis. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered measures of BigBear.ai’s liquidity. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In particular, many of the adjustments to our GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of certain items, as defined in our non-GAAP definitions below, which are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, even where similarly titled, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes and therefore should not be used to compare BigBear.ai’s performance to that of other companies. We endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented by also providing the most directly comparable GAAP measures and descriptions of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and analysts with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key measures used by management to operate and analyze our business over different periods of time. EBITDA is defined as net (loss) before interest expense, interest income, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted for equity-based compensation, employer payroll taxes related to equity-based compensation, net increase (decrease) in fair value of derivatives, restructuring charges, non-recurring strategic initiatives, non-recurring litigation, transaction expenses, goodwill impairment, non-recurring integration costs, capital market advisory fees and commercial start-up costs. Recurring SG&A is defined as selling, general and administrative expense further adjusted for equity-based compensation allocated to selling, general and administrative expense, non-recurring strategic initiatives, non-recurring litigation, and reserves on Virgin Orbit receivables. Similar excluded expenses may be incurred in future periods when calculating these measures. BigBear.ai believes these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. BigBear.ai believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating projected operating results and trends and in comparing BigBear.ai’s financial measures with other similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Management does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP performance measure which is defined in the accompanying tables and is reconciled to net (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure, in the tables above. The Company does not reconcile forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure (or otherwise describe such forward-looking GAAP measure) because it is not able to forecast the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP without unreasonable effort. Certain elements of the composition of the GAAP amounts are not predictable, making it impracticable for the Company to forecast. As a result, no guidance for the Company’s net (loss) income or reconciliation of the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA guidance is provided. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a potentially significant impact on its future net (loss) income. We present reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables above.

Financial Analyst The reported 34% year-over-year increase in net revenue and the 26% increase in adjusted EBITDA are indicative of Broadcom Inc.'s robust financial health and operational efficiency. The inclusion of VMware's financials post-acquisition is a significant contributor to this growth, underscoring the strategic value of M&A activities in the tech sector. The free cash flow, representing 39% of revenue, is particularly impressive, suggesting a strong ability to generate cash and potentially invest in future growth or return capital to shareholders. The planned debt reduction aligns with prudent financial management, especially in an environment where interest rates may rise, impacting the cost of capital. Market Research Analyst With Broadcom's semiconductor solutions seeing moderate growth and its infrastructure software segment skyrocketing by 153%, largely due to the VMware acquisition, the company is diversifying its revenue streams effectively. This positions Broadcom favorably in the market, as it can cater to a broader range of technology demands, particularly in AI data centers and cloud infrastructure. The guidance for fiscal year 2024, projecting a 40% increase in annual revenue, reflects confidence in sustained demand for Broadcom's offerings. However, market conditions, competitive dynamics and global economic factors could impact this outlook, warranting close monitoring by investors. Legal Expert The significant share repurchases and eliminations, totaling $8.29 billion, demonstrate Broadcom's commitment to shareholder value. However, it's essential to consider the legal and regulatory environment surrounding such financial decisions, as they must comply with SEC rules and corporate governance standards. The company's ability to maintain a quarterly dividend of $5.25 per share amidst these activities is a strong signal of its financial stability. The legal perspective also extends to the successful integration of VMware, as it involves navigating complex antitrust laws and intellectual property considerations. 03/07/2024 - 04:15 PM Revenue of $11,961 million for the first quarter, up 34 percent from the prior year periodCash from operations of $4,815 million for the first quarter, less capital expenditures of $122 million, resulted in $4,693 million of free cash flow, or 39 percent of revenueGAAP net income of $1,325 million for the first quarter; Non-GAAP net income of $5,254 million for the first quarterAdjusted EBITDA of $7,156 million for the first quarter, or 60 percent of revenueGAAP diluted EPS of $2.84 for the first quarter; Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $10.99 for the first quarterQuarterly common stock dividend of $5.25 per shareRepurchased and eliminated 7.7 million shares for $8,290 millionFiscal 2024 annual revenue guidance of approximately $50.0 billion including contribution from VMware, an increase of 40 percent from the prior year periodFiscal 2024 annual Adjusted EBITDA guidance of approximately 60 percent of projected revenue (1)PALO ALTO, Calif., March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Broadcom Inc. (Nasdaq: AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, today reported financial results for its first quarter of fiscal year 2024, ended February 4, 2024, provided guidance for its fiscal year 2024 and announced its quarterly dividend. ""We are pleased to have two strong drivers of revenue growth for Broadcom in the first quarter and fiscal year 2024. First, our acquisition of VMware is accelerating revenue growth in our infrastructure software segment, as customers deploy VMware Cloud Foundation. Second, strong demand for our networking products in AI data centers, as well as custom AI accelerators from hyperscalers, are driving growth in our semiconductor segment,"" said Hock Tan, President and CEO of Broadcom Inc. ""We reiterate our fiscal year 2024 guidance for consolidated revenue of $50 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $30 billion."" ""Consolidated revenue grew 34% year-over-year to $12.0 billion, including the contribution from VMware, and was up 11% year-over-year, excluding VMware. Adjusted EBITDA increased 26% year-over-year to $7.2 billion,"" said Kirsten Spears, CFO of Broadcom Inc. ""Free cash flow, excluding restructuring in the quarter, continued to be strong at $5.4 billion. We have started to pay down debt, beginning with $3 billion to date in 2024, and expect to continue to pay down debt in fiscal year 2024.""

The differences between the Company's GAAP and non-GAAP results are described generally under ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below and presented in detail in the financial reconciliation tables attached to this release. Fiscal Year 2024 Business Outlook Based on current business trends and conditions, the outlook for continuing operations for fiscal year 2024, ending November 3, 2024, including the contribution from VMware, is expected to be as follows: Fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance of approximately $50.0 billion; andFiscal year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance of approximately 60 percent of projected revenue.The guidance provided above is only an estimate of what the Company believes is realizable as of the date of this release. The Company is not readily able to provide a reconciliation of projected Adjusted EBITDA to projected net income without unreasonable effort. Actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material. The Company undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise any of these projections, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Quarterly Dividends The Company's Board of Directors has approved a quarterly cash dividend of $5.25 per share. The dividend is payable on March 29, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on March 21, 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures The non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial data is included in the supplemental financial data attached to this press release. Broadcom believes non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into the Company's on-going performance. Therefore, Broadcom provides this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison and to help them evaluate the results of the Company's on-going operations and enable more meaningful period to period comparisons. In addition to GAAP reporting, Broadcom provides investors with net income, operating income, gross margin, operating expenses, cash flow and other data on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP information excludes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related costs, including integration costs, non-GAAP tax reconciling adjustments, and other adjustments. Management does not believe that these items are reflective of the Company's underlying performance. Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of evaluating the core operating performance of the Company, establishing internal budgets, calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives, comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models, strategic planning, evaluating and valuing potential acquisition candidates and how their operations compare to the Company's operations, and benchmarking performance externally against the Company's competitors. The exclusion of these and other similar items from Broadcom's non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual. Free cash flow measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Investors should not consider presentation of free cash flow measures as implying that stockholders have any right to such cash. Broadcom's free cash flow may not be calculated in a manner comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies. About Broadcom Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) is a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor, enterprise software and security solutions.

Net income decreased in Q4 to $16.1 million but increased to $50.7 million for full-year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 was $118.4 million, marking an 8.6% annual increase. CTOS expects growth in 2024 with a focus on capital allocation for shareholder value. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from Custom Truck One Source, Inc. (CTOS) reveal a mixed performance with both positive and negative indicators. The company's total annual revenue growth of 18.6% suggests a robust demand for its specialty equipment. This is further supported by the 29% revenue growth in the TES segment and 10% in the ERS segment. However, quarterly gross profit has seen a slight decrease, which may be indicative of rising costs or pricing pressures. The decrease in quarterly net income and Adjusted EBITDA compared to the previous year's quarter could raise concerns among investors about the company's profitability and cost management in the short term.CTOS's focus on capital allocation and deleveraging, along with its expectation of free cash flow generation, could be a positive signal for long-term value creation. The Net Leverage Ratio of 3.5x and the aim to reduce it below 3.0 times by the end of the fiscal year reflect a strategic approach to debt management. However, the reliance on variable-rate debt has resulted in higher interest expenses, which have impacted net income and could be a point of interest for stakeholders monitoring interest rate trends and their impact on the company's financials.Finally, the company's 2024 outlook projects continued growth, which could be promising, but also notes potential headwinds in the utility market. This forward-looking statement is crucial as it sets expectations for investors and could influence the company's stock performance based on its ability to meet these projections. Market Research Analyst CTOS operates in a niche market, providing specialty equipment to sectors such as electric utility, telecom and rail. The strong demand across these end markets is a testament to the critical nature of infrastructure development and maintenance. The company's record vehicle production is a response to this demand and showcases its operational capabilities.The decrease in rental revenue and fleet utilization in the ERS segment, particularly due to utility market slowdowns, highlights the cyclical nature of CTOS's business and its exposure to external factors such as regulatory changes and supply chain disruptions. The sales order backlog provides visibility into future revenue but is subject to fluctuation based on customer demand and production capacity.The equipment sales growth in the TES segment and the improvement in the APS segment illustrate the company's diversified revenue streams, which can help mitigate risks associated with any single market. The company's strategic focus on managing costs, as seen in the APS segment's gross profit increase, demonstrates an ability to adapt to market conditions and improve margins. Economist CTOS's financial performance reflects broader economic trends, particularly in the infrastructure sectors. The company's growth in revenue and adjusted gross profit indicates strong economic activity in its target markets. However, the variable-rate debt vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations is a macroeconomic risk that has materialized in the form of increased interest expenses, which have negatively impacted net income.The supply chain improvements noted by CTOS are in line with a general easing of global supply chain constraints, which can lead to increased production efficiency and cost savings. However, the company's performance is also influenced by regulatory and funding bottlenecks, which can delay projects and affect equipment rental demand.The company's focus on deleveraging and generating free cash flow is a prudent strategy in an environment where interest rates may rise, increasing the cost of debt servicing. This approach also suggests a forward-looking stance towards maintaining financial health and resilience in the face of potential economic headwinds. 03/07/2024 - 04:15 PM KANSAS CITY, Mo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Custom Truck One Source, Inc. (NYSE: CTOS), a leading provider of specialty equipment to the electric utility, telecom, rail, and other infrastructure-related end markets, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.

Our entire team was instrumental in achieving record vehicle production this year, which helped drive the performance in both segments,” said Ryan McMonagle, Chief Executive Officer of CTOS. “As we head into 2024, we continue to see strong demand from customers across all our primary end-markets and in all three of our business segments. Our outlook for this year makes it clear that we expect 2024 to be another year of growth for Custom Truck. A strong focus on capital allocation this year will allow us to pursue our growth strategy and to deliver free cash flow generation and continued deleveraging, all of which will create long-term value for shareholders,” McMonagle added.

(b) Average OEC on rent — Average OEC on rent is calculated as the weighted-average OEC on rent during the stated period. (c) Fleet utilization — total number of days the rental equipment was rented during a specified period of time divided by the total number of days available during the same period and weighted based on OEC. (d) OEC on rent yield (“ORY”) — a measure of return realized by our rental fleet during a period. ORY is calculated as rental revenue (excluding freight recovery and ancillary fees) during the stated period divided by the Average OEC on rent for the same period. For period less than 12 months, ORY is adjusted to an annualized basis. (e) Sales order backlog — purchase orders received for customized and stock equipment. Sales order backlog should not be considered an accurate measure of future net sales. Management Commentary Total revenue in 2023 was characterized by strong year-over-year customer demand for equipment sales, rental equipment and for parts sales and service, with full-year revenue increasing 18.6% to $1,865.1 million, as compared to full-year revenue in 2022 of $1,573.1 million. In the fourth quarter of 2023, total revenue was $521.8 million, an increase of 7.2% from the fourth quarter of 2022. Equipment sales increased 12.7% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $367.0 million, compared to $325.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting record levels of production, continuing improvements in the supply chain, and our ability to replenish inventory. Full-year 2023 equipment sales revenue improved 27.6% to $1,253.5 million, compared to full-year 2022 equipment sales revenue of $982.3 million. Fourth quarter 2023 rental revenue decreased 5.9% to $120.2 million, compared to $127.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, due to lower utilization and a decline in average OEC on rent. Full-year 2023 rental revenue improved 3.2% to $478.9 million, compared to full-year 2022 rental revenue of $464.0 million. Parts sales and service revenue increased 4.2% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $34.5 million, compared to $33.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full-year 2023 parts sales and service revenue improved 4.8% to $132.7 million, compared to full-year 2022 parts sales and service revenue of $126.7 million. In our ERS segment, rental revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $116.6 million compared to $123.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, a 5.5% decrease. Fleet utilization declined to 77.6% compared to 86.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022, due to a decline in demand in the utility market. Average OEC on rent decreased 8.6% year-over-year, primarily as a result of the lower utilization in the quarter was impacted by a slowdown in transmission work caused by our customers’ supply chain delays, as well as regulatory and funding bottlenecks. Gross profit in the segment in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022 was $63.4 million and $77.8 million, respectively. Adjusted gross profit in the segment was $106.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $117.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted gross profit from rentals, which excludes depreciation of rental equipment, decreased to $88.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $96.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Revenue in our TES segment increased 20.9%, to $298.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, from $247.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, as a result of continued supply chain improvements, which allowed us to acquire more inventory and achieve record production levels that led to greater order fulfillments, as well as sustained strong customer demand. Gross profit improved by 19.1% to $52.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $44.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. At the end of the fourth quarter, TES saw a reduction in backlog of 11.6% to $688.6 million compared to the end of the third quarter of 2023, and a reduction of 8.7% from the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily for the reasons detailed above, as well as the fact that new equipment sales revenue increased 29.5% in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2023. APS segment revenue experienced an increase of $0.6 million, or 1.6%, in the fourth quarter of 2023, to $38.2 million, as compared to $37.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 as a result of growth in demand for parts, tools and accessories (“PTA”) sales. Gross profit in the segment improved 72.8% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $10.6 million, as compared to $6.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 as a result of the Company’s focus on managing costs. Net income was $16.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $30.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in net income is primarily the result of higher interest expense on variable-rate debt and variable-rate floorplan liabilities. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $118.4 million, compared to $124.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was largely driven by higher costs associated with variable-rate floorplan liabilities as a result of higher rates and inventory levels in 2023 compared to 2022. As of December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents was $10.3 million. Total Debt outstanding was $1,517.8 million, Net Debt was $1,507.5 million and Net Leverage Ratio was 3.5x as of December 31, 2023. Availability under the senior secured credit facility was $194.5 million as of December 31, 2023, and based on our borrowing base, we have an additional $323.6 million of availability that we can potentially utilize by upsizing our existing facility. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, Ending OEC decreased by $0.1 million as our fleet additions were more than offset by our continued focus on selling older equipment from our rental fleet at current advantageous residual values. With an average fleet age of 3.5 years, we believe our fleet is well positioned to capitalize from continuing strong rental demand. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, CTOS purchased approximately $18.9 million of its common stock. 2024 Outlook We are providing our full-year revenue and Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2024 at this time. We expect 2024 to be another year of growth. We believe TES will continue to benefit from good demand and our strong backlog entering the year. We believe the ERS outlook from our rental customers for long-term demand and growth remains strong. In 2024, we are currently experiencing some near-term headwinds in our utility end markets, largely related to our customers’ supply chain issues and timing of the commencement of certain transmission projects, which is driving lower OEC on rent in our core T&D markets. As these markets recover and grow in 2024, we expect to further grow our rental fleet (based on net OEC) by mid-single digits. Regarding TES, supply chain improvements, healthy inventory levels exiting 2023, and historically high backlog levels will continue to improve our ability to produce and deliver even more units in 2024. Further, after a year of significant strategic investment in inventory levels in 2023, we expect to generate meaningful free cash flow in 2024, setting a target to generate more than $100 million of levered free cash flow1 and delivering a net leverage ratio of less than 3.0 times by the end of the fiscal year. “Our FY24 outlook reflects the long-term strength of our end markets and the continued focus by our teams to profitably grow our business. The outlook also reflects the risks associated with some continued challenges for our rental customers, particularly in the T&D sector, which we expect could persist through a large portion of the fiscal year,” said Ryan McMonagle, Chief Executive Officer of CTOS. 2024 Consolidated Outlook Revenue $2,000 million — $2,180 million Adjusted EBITDA2 $440 million — $470 million 2024 Revenue Outlook by Segment ERS $730 million — $760 million TES $1,115 million — $1,255 million APS $155 million — $165 million 1 Levered Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less cash flows from investing activities, excluding acquisitions, plus acquisition of inventory through floor plan payables – non-trade less repayment of floor plan payables – non-trade, both of which are included in cash flow from financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 2 CTOS is not able to present a quantitative reconciliation of its forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA for the year ending December 31, 2024 to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net income, because management cannot reliably forecast net income on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and difficulty in predicting certain items that affect GAAP net income including, but not limited to, customer buyout requests on rentals with rental purchase options, income tax expense and changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments. Adjusted EBITDA should not be used to predict net income as the difference between the two measures is variable. CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION The Company has scheduled a conference call at 5:00 P.M.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES In our press release and schedules, and on the related conference call, we report certain financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We utilize these financial measures to manage our business on a day-to-day basis and some of these measures are commonly used in our industry to evaluate performance by excluding items considered to be non-recurring. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide investors expanded insight to assess performance, in addition to the standard GAAP-based financial measures. The press release schedules reconcile the most directly comparable GAAP measure to each non-GAAP measure that we refer to. Although management evaluates and presents these non-GAAP measures for the reasons described herein, please be aware that these non-GAAP measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue, operating income/loss, net income/loss, earnings/loss per share or any other comparable measure prescribed by GAAP. In addition, we may calculate and/or present these non-GAAP financial measures differently than measures with the same or similar names that other companies report, and as a result, the non-GAAP measures we report may not be comparable to those reported by others. Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that we use to monitor our results of operations, to measure performance against debt covenants and performance relative to competitors. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful performance measure because it allows for an effective evaluation of operating performance, without regard to financing methods or capital structures. We exclude the items identified in the reconciliations of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts are either non-recurring or can vary substantially within the industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, including the method by which the assets were acquired, and capital structures. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historical costs of depreciable assets, none of which are reflected in Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an indication that results will be unaffected by the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be identical to other similarly titled measures of other companies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, and other items that we do not view as indicative of ongoing performance. Our Adjusted EBITDA includes an adjustment to exclude the effects of purchase accounting adjustments when calculating the cost of inventory and used equipment sold. When inventory or equipment is purchased in connection with a business combination, the assets are revalued to their current fair values for accounting purposes. The consideration transferred (i.e., the purchase price) in a business combination is allocated to the fair values of the assets as of the acquisition date, with amortization or depreciation recorded thereafter following applicable accounting policies; however, this may not be indicative of the actual cost to acquire inventory or new equipment that is added to product inventory or the rental fleets apart from a business acquisition. Additionally, the pricing of rental contracts and equipment sales prices for equipment is based on OEC, and we measure a rate of return from rentals and sales using OEC. We also include an adjustment to remove the impact of accounting for certain of our rental contracts with customers containing a rental purchase option that are accounted for under GAAP as a sales-type lease. We include this adjustment because we believe continuing to reflect the transactions as an operating lease better reflects the economics of the transactions given our large portfolio of rental contracts. These, and other, adjustments to GAAP net income or loss that are applied to derive Adjusted EBITDA are specified by our senior secured credit agreements. Adjusted Gross Profit. We present total gross profit excluding rental equipment depreciation (“Adjusted Gross Profit”) as a non-GAAP financial performance measure. This measure differs from the GAAP definition of gross profit, as we do not include the impact of depreciation expense, which represents non-cash expense. We use this measure to evaluate operating margins and the effectiveness of the cost of our rental fleet. Net Debt. We present the non-GAAP financial measure “Net Debt,” which is total debt (the most comparable GAAP measure, calculated as current and long-term debt, excluding deferred financing fees, plus current and long-term finance lease obligations) minus cash and cash equivalents. We believe this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors to evaluate our financial position. Net Leverage Ratio. Net leverage ratio is a non-GAAP financial performance measure used by management and we believe it provides useful information to investors because it is an important measure to evaluate our debt levels and progress toward leverage targets, which is consistent with the manner our lenders and management use this measure. We define net leverage ratio as net debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA. CUSTOM TRUCK ONE SOURCE, INC.

This non-GAAP measure is subject to certain limitations. (1) Represents the non-cash impact of purchase accounting, net of accumulated depreciation, on the cost of equipment and inventory sold. The equipment and inventory acquired received a purchase accounting step-up in basis, which is a non-cash adjustment to the equipment cost pursuant to our credit agreement. (2) Represents transaction and process improvement costs related to acquisitions of businesses, including post-acquisition integration costs, which are recognized within operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Net Income (Loss). These expenses are comprised of professional consultancy, legal, tax and accounting fees. Also included are expenses associated with the integration of acquired businesses. These expenses are presented as adjustments to net income (loss) pursuant to our ABL Credit Agreement. (3) Represents the adjustment for the impact of sales-type lease accounting for certain leases containing RPOs, as the application of sales-type lease accounting is not deemed to be representative of the ongoing cash flows of the underlying rental contracts. This adjustment is made pursuant to our credit agreement.

Positive Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corporation (CHMI) reported a GAAP net loss of $35.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Earnings available for distribution attributable to common stockholders were $4.5 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. The company declared a regular common dividend of $0.15 per share, resulting in an annualized common dividend yield of 16.4%. Cherry Hill's Board of Directors authorized a $50 million Preferred Stock repurchase program, with $6.1 million already repurchased as of March 7, 2024. The Company had unrestricted cash of $52.9 million as of December 31, 2023, with $43.9 million available in the repurchase program. Cherry Hill's aggregate portfolio leverage stood at 4.2x at the end of December 31, 2023. The Company's RMBS portfolio had a book value of approximately $1.0 billion and a carrying value of approximately $1.0 billion at quarter-end December 31, 2023. Cherry Hill utilized interest rate swaps, TBAs, and Treasury futures to mitigate duration and interest rate risks associated with its RMBS and MSRs. The Company's net interest spread for the RMBS portfolio stood at 3.82%. Cherry Hill's GAAP book value was $4.53 per diluted share as of December 31, 2023, net of the fourth quarter dividend. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock for the fourth quarter of 2023. Earnings available for distribution ('EAD') is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes certain items to provide insight into the Company's operational performance. Negative The GAAP net loss for Q4 2023 was significant at $35.5 million. Cherry Hill reported a net realized loss of $14.9 million on RMBS and a net unrealized loss of $56.0 million on derivatives for the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company's GAAP net loss applicable to common stockholders was $35.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Cherry Hill's unrealized loss on derivatives, investments in Servicing Related Assets, and net interest expense were notable negative aspects for Q4 2023. Financial Analyst The reported GAAP net loss of $35.5 million by Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corporation is a critical metric that raises concerns about the company's profitability and operational efficiency. This loss is particularly notable when juxtaposed with the previous quarter's net income of $13.1 million. The volatility in earnings is indicative of the risks inherent in the mortgage investment industry, especially given the macroeconomic volatility and fluctuating interest rates.In assessing the earnings available for distribution (EAD), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, we observe a more stable figure of $4.5 million. This suggests that the company has some resilience in terms of cash flow available for shareholders, despite the reported net loss. Investors should consider the sustainability of such distributions, especially in the context of the company's high dividend yield of 16.4%, which may be attractive but also raises questions about long-term viability in a potentially rising rate environment. Market Research Analyst Cherry Hill's authorization of a $50 million Preferred Stock repurchase program, with $6.1 million already executed, reflects a strategic move to manage capital and potentially signal confidence in the intrinsic value of the company's shares. The repurchase program may also be a response to the current discount of the book value per share relative to the common stock price. However, the market's reaction to such a repurchase program will depend on broader market conditions and investor sentiment towards the sector.Additionally, the company's aggregate portfolio leverage of 4.2x needs to be considered in light of industry norms. While leverage can amplify returns, it also increases risk, particularly in a volatile interest rate environment. The use of derivatives, such as interest rate swaps and Treasury futures, is a common strategy to hedge against interest rate risk, but the reported net unrealized loss of $56.0 million on derivatives highlights the complexities and potential drawbacks of such financial instruments. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Analyst For stakeholders in the mortgage REIT sector, Cherry Hill's performance and strategic adjustments, such as realigning the portfolio to mitigate risks, are crucial for maintaining book value amid macro volatility. The unpaid principal balance (UPB) of the Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) portfolio and the net interest spread are key indicators of the health and performance of the investment portfolio. A UPB of $20.0 billion and a net interest spread of 3.82% are significant, as they impact the company's income from servicing and the profitability of the RMBS portfolio.Understanding the company's debt-to-equity ratio, which stands at 4.2x, is essential for evaluating financial stability and risk. This ratio should be compared against industry benchmarks to assess Cherry Hill's leverage relative to peers. While a high debt-to-equity ratio can indicate higher risk, it may also suggest a more aggressive growth strategy, which could lead to higher returns for investors if managed effectively. 03/07/2024 - 04:15 PM FARMINGDALE, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corporation (NYSE: CHMI) (“Cherry Hill” or the “Company”) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023.

The dividends were paid in cash on January 16, 2024 to Series A and B Preferred stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 29, 2023. Earnings Available for Distribution Earnings available for distribution (“EAD”) is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as GAAP net income (loss), excluding realized gain (loss) on RMBS, unrealized gain (loss) on RMBS measured at fair value through earnings, realized and unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives, realized gain (loss) on acquired assets, realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investments in MSRs (net of any estimated MSR amortization) and any tax expense (benefit) on realized and unrealized gain (loss) on MSRs. MSR amortization refers to the portion of the change in fair value of the MSR that is primarily due to the realization of cashflows, runoff resulting from prepayments and an adjustment for any gain or loss on the capital used to purchase the MSR. EAD also includes interest rate swap periodic interest income (expense) and drop income on TBA dollar roll transactions, which are included in “Realized gain (loss) on derivatives, net” on the consolidated statements of income (loss). EAD is adjusted to exclude outstanding LTIP-OP Units in our Operating Partnership and dividends paid on our preferred stock. EAD is provided for purposes of potential comparability to other issuers that invest in residential mortgage-related assets. The Company believes providing investors with EAD, in addition to related GAAP financial measures, may provide investors some insight into the Company’s ongoing operational performance. However, the concept of EAD does have significant limitations, including the exclusion of realized and unrealized gains (losses), and given the apparent lack of a consistent methodology among issuers for defining EAD, it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other issuers, which define EAD differently from us and each other. As a result, EAD should not be considered a substitute for the Company’s GAAP net income (loss) or as a measure of the Company’s liquidity. While EAD is one indicia of the Company’s earnings capacity, it is not the only factor considered in setting a dividend and is not the same as REIT taxable income which is calculated in accordance with the rules of the IRS. The following table provides a reconciliation of net income to EAD for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023: Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 (unaudited) (unaudited) Net Income (Loss) $ (33,644) $ 15,885 Realized loss on RMBS, net 14,851 10,209 Realized loss (gain) on derivatives, net ¹ 2,804 (10,565) Realized gain on acquired assets, net (11) (12) Unrealized loss (gain) on RMBS, measured at fair value through earnings, net (36,321) 19,755 Unrealized loss (gain) on derivatives, net 55,995 (18,343) Unrealized loss (gain) on investments in MSRs, net of estimated MSR amortization 3,777 (11,588) Tax (benefit) expense on realized and unrealized (loss) gain on MSRs (332) 1,684 Total EAD: $ 7,119 $ 7,025 EAD attributable to noncontrolling interests in Operating Partnership (127) (128) Dividends on preferred stock 2,463 2,462 EAD Attributable to Common Stockholders $ 4,529 $ 4,435 EAD Attributable to Common Stockholders, per Diluted Share $ 0.17 $ 0.16 GAAP Net Income (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock, per Diluted Share $ (1.29) $ 0.49 _________ Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts.

Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in net sales to $270 million and gross profit margin to 36% by National Beverage Corp. reflects a robust financial performance, indicative of effective cost management and possibly increased pricing power. The 120 basis points improvement in operating margin and the 14% rise in earnings per share (EPS) suggest operational efficiency and a strong return on investment for shareholders. The growth in cash reserves to $277 million provides the company with a solid liquidity position, which could be utilized for strategic investments or to weather potential market downturns. Investors should consider the potential for sustained growth, given the company's track record of consistent sales growth over eleven quarters. However, they should also be mindful of market saturation risks and the competitive landscape in the beverage industry, which could impact future earnings. Market Research Analyst The introduction of the new LaCroix flavor, Mojito and its national availability is a strategic move to capture consumer interest and potentially increase market share. The company's focus on innovation and product diversification is critical in the beverage industry, where consumer preferences are rapidly evolving. The recognition by Newsweek as one of 'The Most Trusted Brands in America' could enhance brand loyalty and influence consumer purchasing behavior. Furthermore, the company's ability to outperform major competitors and grow its volume significantly could be attributed to effective marketing strategies and a deep understanding of consumer trends. The ongoing commitment to health and longevity themes resonates with current consumer wellness trends, which could further bolster the brand's market position. Economist The financial results of National Beverage Corp. suggest a positive economic impact on the company's stakeholders and hint at a favorable consumer response to beverage products. The double-digit earnings growth and margin expansion signal that the company may be benefiting from economies of scale and potentially a favorable input cost environment. However, macroeconomic factors such as inflation, changes in consumer disposable income and shifts in consumer preferences could influence future performance. It is also worth noting that the beverage industry is sensitive to economic cycles. While the company's current performance is strong, it is important to monitor economic indicators that could affect consumer spending patterns, which in turn, would impact sales and profitability. 03/07/2024 - 04:15 PM FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- National Beverage Corp. (NASDAQ: FIZZ) today announced results for its third quarter ended January 27, 2024. Compared to the prior year: Net sales increased to a record $270 million; Gross profit grew to an all-time high of $97 million and gross profit margin increased to 36% of sales; Operating income rose to $48 million, a record and a 120 bps margin improvement; Earnings per share increased 14% to $.42; and Cash grew to $277 million. “We are pleased to report our eleventh consecutive quarter of record sales coupled with outstanding gross profits and operating income. We continue to deliver strong double-digit earnings growth and expansion of our operating margins. This performance is the result of the caliber of our focus. Focus challenges everything we undertake here at National Beverage and is most evident in our innovation. Nothing is ever accepted unless it succeeds the highest score of the past,” stated a company spokesperson. “Team National continues to innovate and introduce products across our portfolio to delight consumers. Our newest LaCroix flavor, Mojito, brings the sensory feel of paradise directly to consumers and has just recently become available nationally. We are particularly pleased to report that based on a survey of U.S. shoppers, Newsweek once again named LaCroix as one of The Most Trusted Brands in America.” “Recently, a prominent fund manager was visiting National Beverage to see if his fund, which had been investing in National Beverage for a long time, would continue receiving the returns it had enjoyed in the past. He stated that he has followed the company from the days when it had only half its present volume and its toughest competition was the top three beverage companies in the world, yet the company continued to create nearly two-and-one-half times the volume it previously had. He then asked a simple question, ‘How is this possible?’ He went on to further ask, ‘Will this performance continue in the future?’ Yes, was the answer, as long as health and longevity remain top of mind.” “Team National’s strategy remains squarely about health. Although we are known primarily for LaCroix, the leading domestic sparkling water innocent of calories, sweeteners and sodium, our strategic health focus extends widely to all aspects of our company. While others have extended their brands or launched products containing caffeine or alcohol, we have rejected that approach because of our concern for the health of our consumers. Additionally, our beverages are primarily packaged in cans, which are the preeminent choice for recyclability and sustainability. Since the founding of National Beverage, we have operated with a financial philosophy that prioritizes strong healthy cash flows, eschews long-term debt and prioritizes shareholder returns without manipulative stock buybacks. We remain committed to delivering healthy products that strike an emotional and sensory appeal to consumers with outstanding taste. We believe health has been and will long continue to be a tailwind for our consumers and shareholders,” concluded the spokesperson. “Patriotism” – If Only We Could Bottle It! National Beverage Corp.

Positive Record full-year revenues of $291 million despite a soft fourth quarter Launches ISG Tango™, an innovative sourcing platform Record recurring revenues of $125 million, up 16 percent First-quarter dividend of $0.045 per share declared Sets first-quarter revenue guidance between $65 million and $67 million Expects an increase in client demand and AI adoption in 2024 Negative Fourth-quarter revenues down 11 percent from the prior year Operating loss of $3.5 million in the fourth quarter Net loss of $2.9 million in the fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA down 47 percent in the fourth quarter Full-year adjusted EBITDA down 13 percent from the prior year Financial Analyst The reported fourth-quarter and full-year financials for Information Services Group (ISG) reveal a mixed performance with record annual revenues juxtaposed against a quarterly net loss. The recorded bad-debt reserve is a significant factor, which, if excluded, would have resulted in a net income rather than a loss for the quarter. It is vital to assess the company's ability to manage credit risk and the implications of such reserves on future profitability.Despite a soft fourth quarter, the company's year-over-year revenue growth and the launch of ISG Tango™ indicate strategic initiatives to capture new market segments. The dividend declaration suggests confidence in the company's cash flow generation capabilities. However, the decrease in adjusted EBITDA margin year-over-year points to potential operational challenges or increased investments that investors should monitor closely. Market Research Analyst ISG's positioning within the technology research and advisory sector is strengthened by the launch of ISG Tango™ and the Enterprise AI Advisory business. The expansion into the midmarket and the emphasis on AI capabilities suggest a strategic pivot towards high-growth areas. It's important to analyze market trends to understand the potential demand for such services and the competitive landscape.Given the company's mention of a soft fourth quarter attributed to slower client decision-making, it's essential to evaluate the broader macroeconomic conditions and their impact on the IT and business services industry. The anticipated acceleration in client spending, possibly due to easing inflation and central bank policies, could be a key driver for ISG's performance in the upcoming quarters. Economist The financial results of ISG reflect underlying economic currents, with slower client decision-making indicating caution in the face of an uncertain macro environment. The anticipated improvement in client spending is contingent on macroeconomic factors such as inflation and central bank interest rate policies. The company's guidance for the first quarter of 2024 seems to reflect a cautiously optimistic outlook, factoring in these macroeconomic variables.The impact of currency translation on reported revenues, although positive this quarter, is a reminder of the ongoing volatility in foreign exchange markets. Companies like ISG that operate globally must navigate these complexities, which can materially affect financial performance. 03/07/2024 - 04:15 PM Reports fourth-quarter GAAP revenues of $66 million Reports fourth-quarter net loss of $2.9 million, GAAP loss per share of $0.06 and adjusted EPS of $0.06; records bad-debt reserve of $4.8 million in fourth quarter for client collection risk; excluding the reserve, net income and GAAP EPS would have been $0.8 million and $0.02, respectively Reports fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA of $6 million Generates $9.7 million of cash from operations in fourth quarter Achieves record full-year GAAP revenues of $291 million; operating income of $15 million; net income of $6 million and GAAP EPS of $0.12; adjusted EBITDA was $38 million, adjusted net income was $20 million and adjusted EPS was $0.40 Launches ISG Tango™, a groundbreaking sourcing platform that improves transaction speed and efficiency, and opens new market opportunities Declares first-quarter dividend of $0.045 per share, payable March 29, 2024, to shareholders of record as of March 19, 2024 Sets first-quarter guidance: revenues between $65 million and $67 million and adjusted EBITDA between $6.0 million and $7.0 million STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Information Services Group (ISG) (Nasdaq: III), a leading global technology research and advisory firm, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. “ISG delivered record revenues of $291 million for the year, despite a soft fourth quarter due to slower client decision-making in an uncertain macro environment,” said Michael P. Connors, chairman and CEO. “We also delivered record recurring revenues of $125 million, up 16 percent, driven by our research business and our ISG platforms, including ISG GovernX® and ISG ProBenchmark®. Recurring revenues now represent 43 percent of our overall revenue, up 500 basis points from the prior year. “With the overall IT and business services industry down 6 percent for the full year, we consider our topline growth of 2 percent to be solid.” Commenting on the firm’s profitability, Connors said: “Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 13 percent for the year was held back by a fourth quarter that was negatively impacted by slower client decision-making and our decision to retain advisory talent in anticipation of an uplift later this year.” Speaking to the demand environment for 2024, Connors said: “We expect client spending to accelerate as the year progresses, especially if, as expected, inflation continues to cool and central banks respond with interest rate cuts. Our portfolio of services, platforms, research and enterprise AI capabilities should position ISG at the center of a resurgence in technology investments this year.” ISG Launches Next-Gen Sourcing Platform ISG today announced the launch of ISG Tango™, a groundbreaking sourcing platform that digitizes all elements of ISG’s market-leading sourcing transactions business to better serve clients, improve transaction speed and efficiency and allow ISG to expand into other market segments. Developed over the past year, the platform solution, available to enterprise buyers and service providers, draws on ISG’s unmatched data assets, intellectual property and proprietary tools, powered by AI to automate contracting and provide real-time insights that streamline the entire transaction process and accelerate time to agreement. “Speed, real-time transaction data, provider evaluations and other market insights are important to our clients as they navigate a more complex sourcing environment,” said Connors. “ISG Tango delivers on all counts and strengthens our position as the industry’s sourcing advisor of choice.” Connors said ISG Tango will also allow ISG to penetrate the underserved midmarket. “We believe this platform-based offering, combined with our advisory expertise, will allow us to offer a level of sourcing advisory support that would be attractive and affordable to the midmarket, thereby expanding our revenue opportunities.” The launch of ISG Tango comes two months after ISG announced the launch of its new Enterprise AI Advisory business, which offers clients a suite of services to help navigate the complexities and implications of adopting artificial intelligence at scale. ISG has already won significant AI engagements with several large clients, including major companies in the banking, entertainment, manufacturing and public sectors.

Statements contained herein including words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “plan,” “estimate,” “target,” “expect,” “intend,” “will,” “continue,” “should,” “may,” and other similar expressions, are “forward-looking statements” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.

ISG undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Non-GAAP Financial Measures ISG reports all financial information required in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In this release, ISG has presented both GAAP financial results as well as non-GAAP information for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022. ISG believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results will be enhanced if it discloses certain non-GAAP information. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash and certain other special charges that many investors believe may obscure the user’s overall understanding of ISG’s current financial performance and the Company’s prospects for the future. ISG believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they improve the comparability of the financial results between periods and provide for greater transparency of key measures used to evaluate the Company’s performance. ISG provides adjusted EBITDA (defined as net income, plus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, foreign currency transaction gains/losses, non-cash stock compensation, interest accretion associated with contingent consideration, tax indemnity receivables, accounts receivables reserves, acquisition-related costs, and severance, integration and other expense), adjusted net income (defined as net income, plus amortization of intangible assets, non-cash stock compensation, foreign currency transaction gains/losses, interest accretion associated with contingent consideration, acquisition-related costs, accounts receivables reserves, write-off of deferred financing cost and severance, integration and other expense on a tax-adjusted basis), adjusted net income per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA margin, and selected financial data on a constant currency basis which are non-GAAP measures that the Company believes provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses and financial implications of foreign currency translations, which management believes are not indicative of ISG’s core operations. These non-GAAP measures are used by ISG to evaluate the Company’s business strategies and management’s performance. We evaluate our results of operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis. The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of year-over-year fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our results of operations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our business performance and is consistent with how management evaluates the Company’s performance. We calculate constant currency percentages by converting our current and prior-periods local currency financial results using the same point in time exchange rates and then compare the adjusted current and prior period results. This calculation may differ from similarly titled measures used by others and, accordingly, the constant currency presentation is not meant to be a substitution for recorded amounts presented in conformity with GAAP, nor should such amounts be considered in isolation. Management believes this information facilitates comparison of underlying results over time. Non-GAAP financial measures, when presented, are reconciled to the most closely applicable GAAP measure. Non-GAAP measures are provided as additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP estimates contained herein to the corresponding GAAP measures is not being provided, due to the unreasonable efforts required to prepare it.

The company's ARR reached $800 million, and it achieved a 65% non-GAAP subscription and support gross margin. However, services revenue saw a decrease, impacting the revenue outlook for fiscal year 2024. Positive Guidewire's second-quarter revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $240.9 million, showing a 4% increase from the same quarter in fiscal year 2023. Subscription and support revenue rose to $131.6 million, a 24% increase, while services revenue decreased by 29% to $38.2 million compared to the same quarter last year. License revenue also decreased by 3% to $71.1 million. Annual recurring revenue (ARR) stood at $800 million as of January 31, 2024, compared to $763 million in July 2023. Guidewire reported a GAAP loss from operations of $12.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, an improvement from the $23.2 million loss in the same quarter of fiscal year 2023. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $39.1 million, a significant increase from the $17.4 million net loss in the same quarter of fiscal year 2023. Guidewire had $932.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of January 31, 2024. The company's business outlook for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 includes an ARR range of $815 million to $820 million and total revenue between $228 million and $234 million. For fiscal year 2024, Guidewire updated its outlook with an ARR range of $852 million to $862 million and total revenue between $957 million and $967 million. Negative Services revenue saw a decrease of 29% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. Operating loss is expected to be between $(34) million and $(28) million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Guidewire's outlook for fiscal year 2024 includes an operating loss range of $(71) million to $(61) million. The company used $2.8 million in cash from operations during the six months ended January 31, 2024. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Guidewire showcase a mixed performance, with a 4% increase in total revenue and a significant 24% increase in subscription and support revenue. This indicates a strategic shift towards a recurring revenue model, which is a positive sign for long-term financial stability. However, the 29% decrease in services revenue raises questions about the scalability of their services segment and the impact of their strategy to rely on Systems Integrator (SI) partners for cloud engagements.The announcement of an increase in annual recurring revenue (ARR) to $800 million represents a healthy growth trajectory and is a key metric for investors as it provides a more predictable revenue stream. The non-GAAP profitability metrics, such as the increase in non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income, are also encouraging as they suggest improved operational efficiency. However, the reported GAAP losses indicate that there are still costs that need to be managed, such as stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles.The liquidity position, with over $930 million in cash and equivalents, appears robust and provides the company with strategic flexibility. The operating cash flow guidance for fiscal year 2024 is also a strong indicator of the company's ability to generate cash from its core operations. Market Research Analyst Guidewire's performance in the cloud sector is noteworthy, with eleven cloud deals including migrations, expansions and new customers. This reflects a growing market demand for cloud-based solutions within the insurance industry software market. The company's focus on the Guidewire Cloud Platform aligns with broader industry trends towards digital transformation and cloud adoption.The 65% non-GAAP subscription and support gross margins are an important indicator of the profitability of Guidewire's subscription model. High gross margins in this segment can be attributed to lower variable costs associated with delivering cloud services compared to traditional software. This margin performance will likely be closely watched by investors as an indicator of the company's ability to maintain profitability while scaling its cloud offerings. Economist The financial results must be contextualized within the broader economic environment. Given the current economic conditions, Guidewire's ability to increase its ARR and sustain high gross margins is indicative of strong demand for its services, despite a potential slowdown in IT spending. The operating expense discipline mentioned by the CFO suggests a strategic approach to cost management that could help buffer against economic uncertainties.However, the decrease in services revenue may signal a shift in the company's business model or a reallocation of market resources that could affect labor dynamics within the company and its partners. The impact of currency rates is also a factor to consider, as ARR results are based on constant currency rates, which may not reflect actual market conditions and could influence investor perceptions of the company's performance. 03/07/2024 - 04:15 PM SAN MATEO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Guidewire (NYSE: GWRE) today announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2024. “Our strong performance in the second quarter was marked by eleven cloud deals, including a healthy mix of migrations, expansions, and net-new customers,” said Mike Rosenbaum, chief executive officer, Guidewire. “The enthusiasm and interest we’ve seen around Guidewire Cloud Platform is testament to our team’s hard work and our commitment to innovation and excellence.” “We are pleased with the continued cloud momentum, enabling us to beat and raise our ARR outlook and deliver 65% non-GAAP subscription and support gross margins in the quarter,” said Jeff Cooper, chief financial officer, Guidewire. “Our fiscal year 2024 revenue outlook change is due to lower expected services revenue, as we are seeing success with our SI partners leading more cloud engagements at a pace that is faster than we originally expected. We are maintaining our profitability outlook as strong subscription and support gross margin and operating expense discipline offset the impact of lower services revenue.” Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Highlights Revenue Total revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $240.9 million, an increase of 4% from the same quarter in fiscal year 2023. Subscription and support revenue was $131.6 million, an increase of 24%; services revenue was $38.2 million, a decrease of 29%; and license revenue was $71.1 million, a decrease of 3%, each as compared to the same quarter in fiscal year 2023. As of January 31, 2024, annual recurring revenue, or ARR, was $800 million, compared to $763 million as of July 31, 2023. ARR results for interim quarterly periods in fiscal year 2024 are based on actual currency rates at the end of fiscal year 2023, held constant throughout the year. Profitability GAAP loss from operations was $12.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, compared with GAAP loss from operations of $23.2 million for the same quarter in fiscal year 2023. Non-GAAP income from operations was $25.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, compared with non-GAAP income from operations of $15.1 million for the same quarter in fiscal year 2023. GAAP net income was $9.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, compared with GAAP net loss of $9.2 million for the same quarter in fiscal year 2023. GAAP net income per share was $0.12, based on diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 83.3 million, compared to a GAAP net loss per share of $0.11 for the same quarter in fiscal year 2023, based on diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 82.1 million. Non-GAAP net income was $39.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, compared with non-GAAP net loss of $17.4 million for the same quarter in fiscal year 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Guidewire had $932.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments at January 31, 2024, compared to $927.5 million at July 31, 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Metrics This press release contains the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP tax provision (benefit), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, and free cash flow. Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP income (loss) from operations exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, and acquisition consideration holdback. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP tax provision (benefit) also exclude the amortization of debt issuance costs from our convertible senior notes, gain on sale of strategic investment, and the related tax effects of the non-GAAP adjustments. Additionally, Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share excludes the interest expense on convertible debt. Free cash flow consists of net cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs. These non-GAAP measures enable us to analyze our financial performance without the effects of certain non-cash items such as amortization and stock-based compensation. Annual recurring revenue (“ARR”) is used to quantify the annualized recurring value outlined in active customer contracts at the end of a reporting period. ARR includes the annualized recurring value of term licenses, subscription agreements, support contracts, and hosting agreements based on customer contractual terms and invoicing activities for the current reporting period, which may not be the same as the timing and amount of revenue recognized. ARR reflects all fee changes due to contract renewals, non-renewals, expansion, cancellations, attrition, or renegotiations at a higher or lower fee arrangement that are effective as of the ARR reporting date. All components of the licensing and other arrangements that are not expected to recur (primarily perpetual licenses and professional services) are excluded from our ARR calculations. In some arrangements with multiple performance obligations, a portion of recurring license and support or subscription contract value is allocated to services revenue for revenue recognition purposes, but does not get allocated for purposes of calculating ARR. This revenue allocation only impacts the initial term of the contract. This means that as we increase arrangements with multiple performance obligations that include services at discounted rates, more of the total contract value will be recognized as services revenue, but our reported ARR amount will not be impacted. During the six months ended January 31, 2024, the recurring license and support or subscription contract value recognized as services revenue was $5.2 million. Guidewire believes that these non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to Guidewire’s financial condition and results of operations. Guidewire’s management uses these non-GAAP measures and other metrics to compare the Company’s performance to that of prior periods for trend analysis, for purposes of determining executive and senior management incentive compensation, and for budgeting and planning purposes. Guidewire believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing Guidewire’s financial measures with other software companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics to investors. Guidewire's management does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in Guidewire’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Guidewire urges investors to review the reconciliation of its non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly financial results, including the financial tables at the end of this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Guidewire’s business.

(RWT) declares first quarter 2024 common stock dividend of $0.16 per share and Series A preferred stock dividend of $0.625 per share. The Company continues its streak of 99 consecutive quarterly common dividends, emphasizing its commitment to shareholders. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Redwood Trust's declaration of its 99th consecutive quarterly common dividend is a testament to the company's financial stability and commitment to shareholder returns. The consistency in paying out dividends can be an indicator of a company's predictable cash flow and mature business model. A dividend of $0.16 per share, while modest, can be attractive to income-focused investors, particularly in a low-interest-rate environment where fixed income yields may be less competitive.However, it is crucial to assess the dividend yield in the context of the current share price and compare it with industry benchmarks. Investors should also consider the payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends, to evaluate whether the dividends are sustainable in the long term without compromising the company's growth prospects or financial health. Market Research Analyst The authorization of a Series A preferred stock dividend at a rate of 10.00% reflects a substantial yield, which is often higher than common stock dividends due to the preferential treatment of preferred shares in terms of dividends and liquidation. Preferred shares, such as Redwood's Series A, are typically less volatile than common shares and can be appealing to risk-averse investors. However, the attractiveness of these dividends also depends on the overall interest rate environment and the availability of alternative investment opportunities with similar risk profiles.It is important for investors to understand the fixed-rate reset feature associated with Redwood's Series A preferred stock. This feature implies that the dividend rate is subject to reset at predetermined intervals, which can impact the investment's return profile, especially in a changing interest rate landscape. This could affect the demand for the Series A preferred stock and consequently its market price. 03/07/2024 - 04:15 PM MILL VALLEY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Redwood Trust, Inc.

World Kinect Corporation Increases Regular Quarterly Cash Dividend by 21%,2024-03-07T21:15:00.000Z,Low,Very Positive,"World Kinect Corporation (NYSE: WKC) increases quarterly cash dividend by 21% to $0.17 per share. The dividend is payable on April 16, 2024, to shareholders of record on March 25, 2024. The company emphasizes its strong cash flow and balance sheet for continued investments and shareholder returns.","World Kinect Corporation Increases Regular Quarterly Cash Dividend by 21% Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary World Kinect Corporation (NYSE: WKC) increases quarterly cash dividend by 21% to $0.17 per share. The dividend is payable on April 16, 2024, to shareholders of record on March 25, 2024. The company emphasizes its strong cash flow and balance sheet for continued investments and shareholder returns. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision by World Kinect Corporation to increase its dividend by 21% is a significant move that signals confidence in the company's financial health and future prospects. From a financial analyst's perspective, a dividend increase of this magnitude typically suggests that the company is generating robust operating cash flow and has a solid balance sheet, which allows for greater shareholder returns.Investors often view dividend hikes as a positive indicator of a company's performance and management's belief in its ability to maintain or increase profitability. This action could potentially attract income-focused investors and support the stock price. However, it is also essential to consider the payout ratio and whether the increased dividend is sustainable in the long run without compromising the company's growth investments.Furthermore, the combination of dividend payments with share repurchase activities can be an effective way to return capital to shareholders. It may also suggest that the company's leadership believes the stock is undervalued. However, it's important to analyze these activities within the context of the company's overall capital allocation strategy to ensure that they align with long-term strategic goals and do not merely serve as a short-term mechanism to boost stock prices. Market Research Analyst As a market research analyst, it's pertinent to assess the impact of World Kinect Corporation's dividend increase within the industry context. A dividend increase above the industry average can position the company favorably against its peers, potentially leading to a more favorable perception among investors and analysts.It is also critical to understand the market dynamics and investor sentiment surrounding the energy management and logistics services that World Kinect provides. If the industry is on a growth trajectory and the company is outperforming its competitors, the increased dividend could be a reflection of a strong market position and the ability to generate consistent cash flows.However, it's important to monitor how the market reacts to such news. A positive reaction could lead to a rise in the company's stock price, while a negative or indifferent reaction could indicate that the market has priced in the dividend increase or has concerns about the company's future growth prospects. Economist An economist's perspective on the dividend increase by World Kinect Corporation might revolve around the broader economic implications. In an environment where interest rates are fluctuating, a substantial dividend increase could make the company's shares more attractive relative to fixed-income securities, especially if the yield becomes competitive.Moreover, the decision to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases might be indicative of the company's assessment of the macroeconomic environment. In periods of economic uncertainty or slow growth, companies may opt to return excess capital to shareholders rather than reinvesting it in the business, which could signal a lack of attractive investment opportunities.It is also essential to consider the impact of such corporate actions on the company's cost of capital. While returning capital to shareholders is generally viewed positively, it must be balanced with the need to maintain adequate capital reserves to fund future growth and navigate economic downturns. 03/07/2024 - 04:15 PM MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- World Kinect Corporation (NYSE: WKC) announced today that its board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per share, an increase of approximately 21% over its previous dividend of $0.14 per share. The dividend is payable on April 16, 2024, to shareholders of record on March 25, 2024. “Our strong operating cash flow and healthy balance sheet provide us with the flexibility to continue investing in our core business activities while also returning capital to our shareholders,” said Ira M. Birns, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “As part of our broader capital allocation framework, this dividend increase, together with our share repurchase activity, reflects our continued commitment to drive long-term shareholder value.” About World Kinect Corporation Headquartered in Miami, Florida, World Kinect Corporation (NYSE: WKC) is a global energy management company offering fulfillment and related services to more than 150,000 customers across the aviation, marine, and land-based transportation sectors.

Reports Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2023 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Velocity Financial, Inc. (NYSE: VEL) reported a strong performance in the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 with significant increases in net income, core net income, and loan production. The company's strategic growth initiatives and proactive asset management led to record earnings. Velocity aims to achieve a $5 billion loan portfolio by 2025. Positive Net income for the fourth quarter was $17.4 million, a 105.1% increase from the previous year. Core net income rose by 77.2% to $16.2 million. Loan production increased by 21.2% to $352.1 million. Nonperforming loans decreased to 9.7% of Held for Investment loans. For the full-year 2023, Velocity reported a total loan portfolio of $4.1 billion, a 16.0% increase from the previous year. Net income for the year was $52.3 million, compared to $32.2 million in 2022. Core net income saw a significant increase to $53.4 million. The company completed a securitization totaling $202.9 million in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses increased by 40.7% driven by higher compensation expenses and securitization costs. Velocity's total net revenue increased by 59.6% to $51.6 million in the fourth quarter. Resolution activities for long-term and short-term loans in the fourth quarter totaled $70.9 million, realizing 102.2% of UPB resolved. Full-year 2023 saw a decrease in loan production to $1.1 billion, with a net interest margin of 3.34%. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported net income growth of 105.1% and core net income increase of 77.2% for the fourth quarter are significant indicators of the company's robust performance and efficiency in capital management. The notable rise in diluted EPS reflects a strong earnings trajectory, which is likely to be well-received by investors and could positively influence the stock price of Velocity Financial, Inc. The increase in loan production and the improvement in net interest margins suggest an adept response to the challenging interest rate environment, indicating a strategic advantage in pricing power and asset-liability management.Furthermore, the decrease in nonperforming loans as a percentage of HFI loans implies effective credit risk management, which is essential for maintaining loan portfolio health. The company's capital raise and its deployment into accretive investments signal a proactive approach to growth, aligning with the '5X25' strategic goal. These factors combined could potentially lead to an uptick in investor confidence and a positive reevaluation of the company's future earnings potential. Market Research Analyst The year-over-year loan production growth, particularly in the Investor 1-4 Rental and Warehouse property segments, highlights a strong demand for business-purpose loans. This demand is likely driven by a combination of macroeconomic factors and the company's targeted growth strategies. The increase in both loan production volume and weighted average coupon (WAC) suggests that Velocity is not only expanding its lending activities but also doing so at higher yields, which is crucial in a rising interest rate environment.Velocity's focus on business-purpose loans, a niche market segment, may provide a competitive edge and diversification benefits. The reported gains from loan disposition activities and the successful execution of securitizations further underscore the company's operational prowess. The positive resolution rates of nonperforming loans (NPLs) may also reassure investors about the company's asset quality and recovery capabilities. Legal Expert The adoption of fair value accounting for new loan originations as of October 1, 2022, has introduced a new dynamic into the company's financial reporting. The fair value option can lead to increased volatility in reported earnings due to changes in market conditions, which may affect the valuation of loans and securitized debt. Investors and analysts should be aware of these accounting changes and consider the impact on comparability with prior periods. Moreover, the company's compliance with regulatory requirements and the management of legal risks associated with loan servicing and securitization activities are critical for sustaining its growth trajectory and avoiding potential legal entanglements that could adversely affect its financial position. 03/07/2024 - 04:15 PM Fourth Quarter Highlights: Net income of $17.4 million, up 105.1% from $8.5 million for 4Q22.

Discussion of results: Loan production in FY 2023 totaled $1.1 billion in UPB, a 36.5% decrease from $1.8 billion in UPB for 2022 Driven by higher interest rates throughout most of FY 2023 Net interest margin (NIM) was 3.34% for FY 2023, a 30 bps decrease from 3.64% for FY 2022 Driven by higher securitization and warehouse financing costs Partially offset by a higher weighted average coupon on 2023 loan production of 11.1% compared to 8.0% for FY 2022 Average NPLs were $328.1 million for FY 2023, an increase of 23.3% from the FY 2022 average of $266.1 million Average NPLs as a percentage of average loans HFI were 8.7% for FY 2023, compared to 8.6% for FY 2022 Net charge-off and gain/(loss) on REO activity for FY 2023 was a gain of $2.0 million, compared to a gain of $5.5 million for FY 2022 Net income totaled 52.3 million for FY 2023, a 62.3% increase from 32.2 million for FY 2022 Net interest income (after corporate interest expense and provision for loan losses) totaled $105.8 million, a 29.1% increase from $82.0 million in FY 2022, driven by HFI portfolio growth and higher coupons on FY 2023 loan production Other income totaled $65.9 million, a 171.0% increase from $24.3 million in FY 2022, driven by the net impact of the Company’s fair value accounting election for loan production originated after October 1, 2022, and unrealized fair value losses on securitized debt Expenses totaled $119.5 million, a 61.2% increase from $74.1 million in FY 2022, driven by an increase in compensation expense related to the Company’s fair value accounting election and securitization costs resulting from the issuance of six VCC securitizations in 2023. Under fair value accounting, securitization costs are expensed as incurred, whereas previously they were deferred and amortized over the life of the securitization.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our financial statements presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company uses non-GAAP core net income and core diluted EPS, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP core net income and non-GAAP core diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that represent our net income (loss) and net income (loss) per diluted share, adjusted to eliminate the effect of certain costs incurred from activities that are not normal recurring operating expenses, such as COVID-stressed charges and recoveries of loan loss provision, nonrecurring debt amortization, the impact of operational measures taken to address the COVID-19 pandemic and workforce reduction costs, and costs associated with acquisitions. To calculate non-GAAP core diluted EPS, we use the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding that is used to calculate net income per diluted share under GAAP. We have included non-GAAP core net income and non-GAAP core diluted EPS because they are key measures used by our management to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses and the allocation of internal resources. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP core net income and non-GAAP core diluted EPS provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. In addition, they provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as they remove the effect of certain items that we expect to be nonrecurring. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. For more information on Core Income, please refer to the section of this press release below titled “Adjusted Financial Metric Reconciliation to GAAP Net Income” at the end of this press release.

(NYSE: IOT) announces new enhancements to strengthen data security and privacy, achieving four industry-leading ISO certifications. The company integrates Trust Services Criteria into its SOC 2 scope, emphasizing customer data protection and security. Positive None. Negative None. Cybersecurity Expert With Samsara Inc. acquiring multiple ISO certifications and incorporating the Trust Services Criteria into its SOC 2 scope, the company is evidently reinforcing its cybersecurity framework. These certifications, particularly ISO 27001, represent a commitment to establishing and maintaining a proactive approach to managing information security risks. The inclusion of ISO 27017 and ISO 27018 further highlights a focus on cloud security and personal data protection, which is critical as businesses increasingly migrate to cloud-based operations.From a cybersecurity standpoint, these developments can enhance customer trust and potentially lead to new business opportunities as clients prioritize vendors with robust security credentials. However, it's essential to monitor how these certifications translate into tangible security improvements and whether they result in reduced incidents of data breaches or other cyber threats, which can have direct financial implications and impact on the company's reputation. Compliance Officer Attaining ISO 27701 certification is particularly significant for Samsara given the evolving landscape of data privacy regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA. This standard provides a framework for Privacy Information Management Systems (PIMS), which is instrumental for compliance with data protection laws. The certification shows Samsara's proactive stance on privacy management and can be a differentiator in markets where data protection is heavily regulated.Moreover, Samsara's move to integrate Trust Services Criteria for confidentiality into its SOC 2 report is indicative of its commitment to transparency and third-party validation of its internal controls. This can reassure stakeholders of the company's dedication to safeguarding sensitive information, which is increasingly important in vendor assessments and could influence investment decisions. IT Compliance Analyst Samsara's mention of the 'In Process' status for StateRAMP indicates an alignment with government security standards, which could open doors to public sector contracts. StateRAMP is a security framework tailored for state and local government cloud service providers, paralleling the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). A verified StateRAMP offering can significantly boost a company's eligibility for government contracts, potentially leading to revenue growth.While these certifications and efforts underscore a robust security and privacy posture, it is important for investors to consider the ongoing costs associated with maintaining these standards. Regular audits, continuous improvements and technology investments are required to uphold the certifications, which can impact operating expenses. However, these costs can be viewed as strategic investments that strengthen the company's competitive edge and long-term sustainability in the market. 03/07/2024 - 04:15 PM SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Samsara Inc.

Announces Dividend of $0.35 per Share Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary MFA Financial, Inc. (MFA) declares a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share of common stock, to be paid on April 30, 2024. The company has a strong history of dividend distribution, totaling over $4.7 billion since its IPO in 1998. MFA specializes in residential mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities, and real estate assets, with a subsidiary providing business purpose loans for real estate investors. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by MFA Financial, Inc. regarding the quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share is a reflection of the company's capital allocation strategy and its ability to generate consistent cash flows from its investment portfolio. The distribution of dividends can signal to the market a stable or improving financial health and often plays a role in the stock's attractiveness to income-focused investors.Dividend payments are typically funded from earnings and thus, the sustainability of these payments is contingent upon MFA Financial's operational performance, particularly its earnings from residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. Given the company's history of distributing over $4.7 billion in dividends since its IPO, it suggests a track record that could be appealing to shareholders looking for reliable dividend income.However, it is essential to consider the broader economic context, such as interest rate trends and housing market dynamics, which can significantly impact the performance of real estate investment trusts (REITs) and their ability to maintain dividend payouts. A thorough analysis would also compare the dividend yield to sector averages and assess the payout ratio to determine if the dividend is being covered by earnings or if it might strain the company's finances in the long run. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the declaration of dividends by MFA Financial, Inc. may have implications for the stock's performance in the equity market. Dividends can be a catalyst for share price movements as they offer a tangible return on investment. The ex-dividend date, which in this case precedes the payment date on March 28, 2024, is crucial for investors since shares bought on or after this date do not qualify for the declared dividend.Investors often look at dividend announcements as indicators of a company's confidence in its financial stability and future earnings potential. In the case of MFA Financial, the consistency of dividend payments could be interpreted as a positive signal, potentially attracting dividend investors and possibly impacting the stock's liquidity and volatility around the announcement period.It is also beneficial to analyze historical dividend growth rates and the company's strategic investments, such as those through its subsidiary Lima One Capital, to predict future performance. The real estate investment sector is highly sensitive to interest rate changes and therefore, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy could significantly influence the company's investment yields and, consequently, its ability to sustain or increase dividend payments. 03/07/2024 - 04:15 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MFA Financial, Inc. (NYSE: MFA) announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share of common stock.

E-commerce sales saw significant increases, with a growth rate of 18.4% for the quarter. Costco operates 875 warehouses globally and continues to expand its presence in various countries. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in net sales for Costco demonstrates a steady growth trajectory, a positive signal for investors and stakeholders. The 5.7 percent growth in quarterly sales and 5.9 percent for the first 24 weeks, despite the fiscal calendar shift, indicates resilience in Costco's business model. The growth in e-commerce sales at 18.4 percent for the quarter is particularly noteworthy, showcasing Costco's ability to capitalize on the digital shopping trend, which is becoming increasingly important in the retail sector. This pivot towards online sales could also reflect a broader industry shift, where traditional brick-and-mortar retailers are enhancing their digital platforms to meet changing consumer behaviors.Furthermore, the increase in net income and earnings per diluted share suggests improved profitability and operational efficiency. The $94 million tax benefit that positively impacted this year's second quarter net income is a one-off event, but it still represents a strategic financial advantage. Investors should consider the sustainability of such profit margins without similar benefits in the future. Market Research Analyst Costco's performance in various international markets, with Canada and Other International segments showing robust growth, indicates successful international expansion strategies. This geographical diversification can be a hedge against market-specific risks. The company's strong performance in these regions may also be indicative of its ability to adapt to different market dynamics and consumer preferences, which is a critical capability for global retailers.The comparable sales growth, adjusted for gasoline prices and foreign exchange, provides a clearer picture of the underlying retail performance. The consistent positive figures across the board suggest that Costco's value proposition continues to resonate with its membership base. This metric is crucial as it reflects the health of the business without the noise of external factors. Economist Analyzing the broader economic implications, the consistent increase in sales despite potential headwinds such as inflationary pressures or economic downturns reflects consumer loyalty and the effectiveness of Costco's pricing strategy. The company's ability to maintain growth in net sales and comparable sales suggests that it may be well-positioned to weather economic fluctuations. The reported data could be an indicator of consumer spending patterns, with Costco possibly benefiting from a trend where consumers seek value during tighter economic conditions. 03/07/2024 - 04:15 PM ISSAQUAH, Wash., March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Costco Wholesale Corporation (“Costco” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: COST) today announced its operating results for the second quarter (twelve weeks) and the first 24 weeks of fiscal 2024, ended February 18, 2024. Net sales for the quarter increased 5.7 percent, to $57.33 billion, from $54.24 billion last year. Net sales for the first 24 weeks increased 5.9 percent, to $114.05 billion, from $107.68 billion last year. Net sales for the Company were negatively impacted by approximately one and one-half percent for the quarter and by approximately one-half percent for the first 24 weeks of fiscal 2024 from the shift of the fiscal calendar, as a result of the fifty-third week last year. The following comparable sales data reflect comparable locations year-over-year and comparable retail weeks. Comparable sales for the second quarter and first 24 weeks of fiscal 2024 were as follows: 12 Weeks 12 Weeks 24 Weeks 24 Weeks Adjusted* Adjusted*U.S.4.3% 4.8% 3.1% 3.7%Canada9.2% 9.0% 7.8% 8.6%Other International8.6% 8.2% 9.8% 7.7% Total Company5.6% 5.8% 4.7% 4.8% E-commerce18.4% 18.2% 12.2% 12.0% *Excluding the impacts from changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange. Net income for the quarter was $1,743 million, $3.92 per diluted share, compared to $1,466 million, $3.30 per diluted share, last year. This year's second quarter net income was positively impacted by a $94 million ($0.21 per diluted share) tax benefit due to the deductibility of the $15 per share special dividend to the extent received by 401(k) plan participants. Net income for the first 24 weeks was $3.33 billion, $7.49 per diluted share, compared to $2.83 billion, $6.37 per diluted share, last year.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/07/2024 - 04:15 PM Acquisition Will Add 3,700 New Customers CAMDEN, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- New Jersey American Water announced today it has signed an agreement to acquire the wastewater collection system (commonly referred to as the sewer system) of the Borough of Manville, N.J. for $6.5 million. This municipally owned system serves approximately 3,700 customers, most of whom already receive water service from New Jersey American Water. The agreement follows a voter referendum that took place in November 2023, in which over 80 percent of the voters approved the sale of the system to New Jersey American Water. “I want to thank the residents and elected officials of Manville for entrusting us to manage and improve their sewer utility and help safeguard the Borough and the environment from the many risks associated with operating a sewer collection system,” said Mark McDonough, president of New Jersey American Water. “We have extensive experience and expertise in providing drinking water and sewer service. As Manville’s longtime water company, we remain committed to making the needed improvements to provide the community with sewer service that is as safe, reliable and affordable as the water service we provide.” As part of the acquisition agreement, and subject to approval from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJ BPU), New Jersey American Water will invest a minimum of $10 million in sewer system improvements in the ten years following completion of the acquisition. The system upgrades include addressing inflow and infiltration, flood mitigation efforts, and sewer main repairs and replacements. The agreement also includes short- and long-term rate stability proposals. “Selling the sewer system to New Jersey American Water provides a number of benefits to the Borough and our residents including stabilizing municipal property taxes and freeing up Borough resources to be dedicated to other responsibilities,” said Mayor Richard Onderko. “New Jersey American Water continues to put Manville customers first and I trust them to maintain our sewer system with the same level of responsibility and dedication which they do our water system.” Additional customer benefits include combined monthly billing for water and sewer, and extending the monthly water service charge discount to the monthly sewer service charge for income-qualifying customers who participate in the company’s H2O: Help to Others program. New Jersey American Water is working with the Borough to help ensure a smooth transition for customers. The company anticipates completing the acquisition in the second half of 2024, pending approval from the NJ BPU.

(NASDAQ: GIFI) reported strong financial results for Q4 and full year 2023, with increased revenue, net income, and adjusted EBITDA. The Company substantially completed remaining ferry projects, resolved MPSV Litigation, and focused on profitable growth strategies. Positive Consolidated revenue for Q4 2023 was $44.6 million, a 17% increase from the prior year. Net income was $7.1 million with adjusted EBITDA of $6.6 million. Full year 2023 revenue was $151.1 million, with a net loss of $24.4 million and adjusted EBITDA of $17.0 million. Gulf Island resolved MPSV Litigation, resulting in a charge of $32.5 million and a promissory note agreement of $20.0 million payable to the Surety. Strategic initiatives focused on traditional offshore markets, new growth end markets, services business expansion, project execution, and skilled workforce expansion. Segment results showed revenue growth in Services and Fabrication segments, with operating income improvements and adjusted EBITDA increases. The Company ended 2023 with a cash balance of nearly $48 million, further strengthened by a property sale generating $8.5 million in net cash proceeds. Negative Consolidated net loss for full year 2023 was $24.4 million, compared to a net loss of $3.4 million in the prior year. Shipyard Division recorded losses of $39.4 million for full year 2023, impacting consolidated adjusted EBITDA. Challenges with under-recovery of overhead costs and lower utilization of facilities affected Fabrication Division's operating results. Corporate Division reported an operating loss of $2.1 million for Q4 2023. Financial Analyst Gulf Island Fabrication, Inc.'s announcement of its fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results indicates a significant turnaround in profitability, particularly in the fourth quarter. The company's consolidated net income of $7.1 million for Q4 2023, compared to $0.5 million in the prior year, represents a noteworthy improvement. This surge in net income can be attributed to increased revenue and the successful execution of strategic initiatives, which appear to have enhanced operational efficiency. The substantial increase in adjusted EBITDA from $2.3 million in the prior year to $6.6 million in Q4 2023 further underscores this point.From a financial standpoint, the company's cash and short-term investments balance of $47.9 million as of December 31, 2023, provides it with a robust liquidity position. This is further bolstered by the sale of excess property in February 2024, which added approximately $8.5 million to their cash reserves. Such a strong liquidity position offers the company significant financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities and potentially enhance shareholder value. Investors may find reassurance in the company's financial health and its ability to weather economic uncertainties or invest in strategic initiatives. Market Research Analyst The industrial and energy sectors, where Gulf Island operates, have shown resilience and growth, which is reflected in the company's revenue increase. The 17% year-over-year growth in fourth quarter revenue indicates a robust demand for Gulf Island's services. The strategic focus on small-scale fabrication and services, including the Spark Safety services offering, seems to be paying off, with the Services Division operating income increasing by 35% for the full year 2023.The company's strategic pivot away from its Shipyard Division, with the substantial completion of remaining ferry projects, suggests a refocusing of resources towards more profitable segments. This shift aligns with broader industry trends where companies are streamlining operations to focus on core, high-margin activities. Gulf Island's management appears to be executing a disciplined growth strategy, which is evidenced by their projected EBITDA for 2024 and their emphasis on pursuing projects with adequate risk-adjusted returns. Legal Expert The resolution of the MPSV Litigation is a critical development for Gulf Island. The dismissal of the lawsuit and the subsequent agreement with the Surety not only eliminates a significant legal overhang but also provides clarity on future financial obligations. The promissory note agreement, which replaces the liability with a structured repayment plan, offers a clear pathway for the company to manage its debt obligations without undue financial strain. This resolution removes a substantial uncertainty and allows management to focus on core business activities without the distraction of ongoing litigation.It is also important to note the impact of the $32.5 million charge recorded by the Shipyard Division due to the litigation resolution, which significantly affected the full year 2023 revenue figures. The transparent handling of this charge and its reflection in the financial statements, demonstrates the company's commitment to clear financial reporting practices. Stakeholders should appreciate the finalization of this legal matter and the company's proactive approach to addressing and communicating its impact. 03/07/2024 - 04:10 PM THE WOODLANDS, Texas, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gulf Island Fabrication, Inc.

MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY “Our strong fourth quarter results cap off an excellent year for Gulf Island and reflect the continued favorable end market trends in our core Gulf Coast region, combined with the benefits of the successful execution of our strategic initiatives,” said Richard Heo, Gulf Island’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our fourth quarter revenue increased 17% from last year as a result of ongoing momentum in our small-scale fabrication and services businesses, including a strong contribution from our Spark Safety services offering launched in 2022. For our Services division, we continue to execute on our strategy of deploying assets to higher margin opportunities and growing Spark Safety, which enabled us to increase our Services operating income by 35% for the full year 2023. We also continued to demonstrate strong project execution and bidding discipline for our Fabrication division, which resulted in full year Fabrication gross margins of over 11%. This is a strong result for the division given the partial under-utilization of our facilities and resources. I am extremely pleased with the execution across our businesses and I am confident that Gulf Island is well positioned to benefit from continued end market strength expected in our core Gulf Coast region.” “I am proud of the continued execution of our strategic plan during 2023, and we enter 2024 in a strong position to continue our focus on profitable growth,” continued Heo. “While we continued to make important progress on our initiatives focused on the services and fabrication businesses, the most important achievements of 2023 center on the substantial completion of our shipyard wind down and the successful resolution of the MPSV Litigation. With these distractions behind us, we are fully focused on taking advantage of the strong growth platform we have created in our services and fabrication businesses and utilizing our solid financial position to deploy capital to further enhance shareholder value.” “Our services and small-scale fabrication businesses form a profitable and stable base business for Gulf Island to continue to build on,” continued Heo. “During 2024, we expect favorable market conditions and continued execution of our strategic initiatives to drive continued growth in these core businesses. For 2024, we expect Services EBITDA of approximately $14 million and Fabrication EBITDA of approximately $8 million, which excludes the potential benefit of any large project award. We are encouraged by the strength of our base business and are excited by our opportunities for growth.” “Our strong operating results for the fourth quarter, together with an ongoing focus on working capital management, resulted in a year-end cash balance of nearly $48 million,” stated Westley Stockton, Gulf Island’s Chief Financial Officer. “In February 2024, we completed the sale of excess property that generated net cash proceeds of approximately $8.5 million, further strengthening our financial position. Based on our expectations of operating results for the first quarter 2024 and the proceeds of our recent property sale, we expect to exit the first quarter with a cash balance approaching $60 million. This will provide us with significant financial flexibility to pursue our growth objectives, which include attractive organic and inorganic opportunities.” “This was an exciting year for Gulf Island, one that would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our employees across the organization,” noted Heo. “While we remain encouraged by the large project opportunities in our fabrication business, we are excited by the momentum in our services and small-scale fabrication businesses, which combined with our ability to take advantage of our strong financial flexibility, position the company to drive value for shareholders. I am very proud of all our accomplishments during 2023, and remain confident that 2024 will build on the strong foundation we have established,” concluded Heo. RESOLUTION OF MPSV LITIGATION As previously disclosed, on October 4, 2023, the Company’s lawsuit relating to the construction of two multi-purpose supply vessels (“MPSV Litigation”) was dismissed in full with prejudice at the request of the parties to the litigation. In addition, on November 6, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with the issuer (the “Surety”) of the performance bonds for the MPSV construction contracts, pursuant to which the Surety released the Company from all of its obligations under the performance bonds and the associated general indemnity agreements related to the performance bonds, and the Company released possession of the MPSVs to the Surety during the fourth quarter 2023. Further, the Company entered into a promissory note (“Note Agreement”) payable to the Surety in the principal amount of $20.0 million. The Note Agreement bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.0% per annum commencing on January 1, 2024, with principal and interest payable in 15 equal annual installments of approximately $1.7 million, beginning on December 31, 2024 and ending on December 31, 2038. As a result of the resolution of the MPSV Litigation, during the third quarter 2023, the Company’s Shipyard Division recorded a charge of $32.5 million, consisting of a non-cash charge of $12.5 million associated with the write-off of a noncurrent net contract asset related to the MPSV construction contracts, and a charge of $20.0 million associated with recording a liability resulting from the Settlement Agreement and Note Agreement. The charge was reflected as a reduction to previously recognized revenue on the MPSV construction contracts, resulting in a negative revenue amount for the Shipyard Division for the third quarter and full year 2023. The liability was replaced with the Note Agreement in the fourth quarter 2023 and is reflected as current and long-term debt at December 31, 2023. The estimated present value of the Note Agreement amount is $12.7 million based on an estimated market rate of interest. STRATEGIC UPDATE During 2023, Gulf Island continued to execute on the second phase of its strategic transformation, which is focused on generating stable, profitable growth based on pursuing new growth end markets, growing and diversifying its services business, further strengthening project execution, and expanding its skilled workforce, while continuing to pursue opportunities in its traditional offshore markets. Some of the key accomplishments achieved during 2023, as well as key priorities for 2024, are as follows: Pursue traditional offshore markets – The demand environment for traditional offshore activities in the Gulf of Mexico was robust during 2023, resulting in favorable growth trends for both services and small-scale fabrication projects. Driven by relative stability in oil prices and healthy customer balance sheets, the momentum in the Gulf of Mexico is anticipated to continue into 2024, which is expected to result in continued growth in the coming year. Pursue new growth end markets – Gulf Island has a strong foundation to pursue new growth opportunities in its core Gulf Coast region, primarily in the LNG, petrochemical, and energy transition markets. Bidding activity on large fabrication project opportunities remains active, driven by strong industry fundamentals combined with limited industry capacity. However, project decision cycles are extending due to higher interest rates and a challenging permitting environment, which has been exacerbated for the LNG market by the recent announcement from the current administration calling for a pause on LNG export project approvals. While the Company remains confident that it is well-positioned to be awarded large project opportunities, management will remain disciplined and continue its focus on profitably growing its services and small-scale fabrication businesses. Grow and diversify services business – Gulf Island continues to expand its services business, driven by the favorable demand trends for offshore services combined with the contribution of Spark Safety, the Services Division’s welding enclosures business line. Services revenue grew by 7.5% during 2023, and for 2024, the Company is focused on strategic opportunities that capitalize on the opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico. Further strengthen project execution and maintain bidding discipline – Project execution and bidding discipline remain a key priority given inflationary pressures and challenges with the availability of skilled labor. The Company’s pursuit of consistent project execution was reflected in the strong margin performance during 2023, with Services gross margins expanding 180 basis points year-over-year, and Fabrication gross margins reaching 11.4% for 2023 despite the partial under-utilization of the division’s facilities and resources. Gulf Island will maintain its focus on project execution in 2024 and remain disciplined in pursuing projects that provide adequate risk-adjusted returns. Expand skilled workforce – A strong skilled workforce is critical to success in the services and fabrication markets, particularly given the current competitive industry-wide labor environment. Gulf Island was able to maintain its skilled labor headcount in Services during 2023 despite the challenging labor environment. The Company remains confident in its proven ability to ramp up headcount in Fabrication to support new project awards, which places the Company in a strong position to grow its fabrication business. The Company continues to evaluate opportunities to expand its skilled labor headcount in 2024 given the favorable demand trends, including strategic acquisitions to increase craft labor headcount. SEGMENT RESULTS FOR FOURTH QUARTER 2023 Services Segment – Revenue for the fourth quarter 2023 was $24.5 million, an increase of $2.9 million, or 13.4%, compared to the fourth quarter 2022, due primarily to incremental revenue associated with the division’s Spark Safety business line. New project awards were $24.2 million for the fourth quarter 2023, representing a 13.5% year-over-year increase, and backlog totaled $0.5 million at December 31, 2023. The new award growth was driven primarily by the Spark Safety business line. See “Non-GAAP Measures” below for the Company’s definition of new project awards and backlog. Operating income was $2.7 million for the fourth quarter 2023, compared to operating income of $2.2 million for the fourth quarter 2022. EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2023 was $3.2 million (or 13.2% of revenue), versus EBITDA of $2.6 million (or 11.9% of revenue) for the prior year period, an increase of 25.1%. The improved operating results for 2023 compared to 2022 were primarily due to higher revenue and a more favorable project margin mix, including the benefit of the division’s Spark Safety business line. See “Non-GAAP Measures” below for the Company’s definition of EBITDA and a reconciliation of the Services Division operating income to EBITDA. Fabrication Segment – Revenue for the fourth quarter 2023 was $19.7 million, an increase of $3.3 million, or 19.8%, compared to the fourth quarter 2022, due primarily to higher small-scale fabrication activity and the favorable resolution of customer change orders. New project awards were $19.9 million for the fourth quarter 2023, representing a 15.1% year-over-year increase, and backlog totaled $11.7 million at December 31, 2023. New awards for the fourth quarter 2023 were related to small-scale fabrication work and the favorable resolution of customer change orders. See “Non-GAAP Measures” below for the Company’s definition of new project awards and backlog. Operating income was $6.1 million for the fourth quarter 2023, compared to operating income of $4.1 million for the fourth quarter 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2023 was $5.4 million, versus adjusted EBITDA of $2.0 million for the prior year period, an increase of 171.1%. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2023 and 2022 exclude gains of $1.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively, from the net impact of insurance recoveries and costs associated with damage previously caused by Hurricane Ida. The improved operating results for 2023 compared to 2022 (excluding the Hurricane Ida impacts) were primarily due to project improvements resulting from the resolution of customer change orders and a more favorable project margin mix. This improvement was partially offset by an increase in the under-recovery of overhead costs associated with lower utilization of facilities and resources resulting from the cancellation of the division’s large fabrication contract (in July 2023), offset partially by an increase in work hours associated with higher small-scale fabrication activity. See “Non-GAAP Measures” below for the Company’s definition of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of the Fabrication Division operating income to adjusted EBITDA. Shipyard Segment – Revenue for the fourth quarter 2023 was $0.6 million, an increase of $0.2 million compared to the fourth quarter 2022. Revenue for both quarters was related entirely to the division’s seventy-vehicle ferry and forty-vehicle ferry projects. The seventy-vehicle ferry was completed, delivered and accepted by the customer during the fourth quarter 2023. The final forty-vehicle ferry was substantially completed and delivered during the fourth quarter 2023 and final customer acceptance of the ferry is expected in March 2024. Operating loss was $0.1 million for the fourth quarter 2023, compared to an operating loss of $3.6 million for the fourth quarter 2022. Operating results for the fourth quarter 2023 and 2022 included project charges of $0.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, associated with the division’s seventy-vehicle ferry and forty-vehicle ferry projects. Corporate Segment – Operating loss was $2.1 million for the fourth quarter 2023, compared to an operating loss of $2.3 million for the fourth quarter 2022. EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2023 was a loss of $2.0 million, versus a loss of $2.3 million for the prior year period. Segment Descriptions – The Company’s divisions represent its reportable segments which are “Services”, “Fabrication”, “Shipyard” and “Corporate”. The Services Segment includes offshore and onshore services work performed at customer facilities, including offshore platforms. The Fabrication Segment includes all fabrication work performed on-site at the Company’s facilities, including pull-through fabrication work for the Services Segment. The Shipyard Segment includes two ferries under construction that were substantially completed in the fourth quarter 2023, and vessel holding costs and legal fees associated with the Company’s previous MPSV Litigation (discussed above). The wind down of the Company’s Shipyard Segment operations was substantially completed in the fourth quarter 2023 with the substantial completion of the ferry projects. The Corporate Segment includes costs that are not directly related to the Company’s operating segments, including the costs of being a publicly traded company. BALANCE SHEET AND LIQUIDITY The Company’s cash and short-term investments balance at December 31, 2023 was $47.9 million, including $1.5 million of restricted cash associated with outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2023, the Company had current and long-term debt of $20.0 million associated with the Note Agreement. During the fourth quarter 2024, the Company repurchased 29,578 shares of its common stock for $0.1 million under its share repurchase program commenced in December 2023. See “Resolution of MPSV Litigation” above for discussion of the Note Agreement. 2024 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK Gulf Island is providing indicative segment and consolidated guidance for the full year 2024. Services segment EBITDA is expected to be approximately $14.0 million, driven primarily by continued growth in the Spark Safety business line. Fabrication segment EBITDA is expected to be approximately $8.0 million, which includes year-over-year growth in the small-scale fabrication business, but excludes the potential benefit of any large project award. The forecast also excludes an anticipated gain of approximately $2.9 million resulting from the previously disclosed property sale in February 2024. Forecasted 2024 EBITDA for Fabrication is lower than 2023 levels due to the prior year benefiting from the contribution of the division’s large fabrication project that was cancelled during the year. Corporate segment EBITDA is expected to be a loss of approximately $8.0 million, which is consistent with recent historical experience. This forward-looking guidance reflects management’s current expectations and beliefs as of March 7, 2024, and is subject to change. See“Cautionary Statement” below for further discussion of the factors that may affect the Company’s future performance, “Non-GAAP Measures” below for the Company’s definition of EBITDA, and “2024 Financial Outlook - Segment and Consolidated EBITDA Reconciliations” below for reconciliations of segment and consolidated EBITDA to the most comparable GAAP measures. FOURTH QUARTER 2023 CONFERENCE CALL Gulf Island will hold a conference call on Thursday, March, 7, 2024 at 4:00 p.m. Central Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) to discuss the Company’s financial results. The call will be available by webcast and can be accessed on Gulf Island’s website at www.gulfisland.com. Participants may also join the call by dialing 1.877.704.4453 and requesting the “Gulf Island” conference call. A replay of the webcast will be available on the Company's website for seven days after the call. ABOUT GULF ISLAND Gulf Island is a leading fabricator of complex steel structures and modules and provider of specialty services, including project management, hookup, commissioning, repair, maintenance, scaffolding, coatings, welding enclosures, civil construction and staffing services to the industrial and energy sectors. The Company’s customers include U.S. and, to a lesser extent, international energy producers; refining, petrochemical, LNG, industrial and power operators; and EPC companies. The Company is headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas and its primary operating facilities are located in Houma, Louisiana. NON-GAAP MEASURES This release includes certain non-GAAP measures, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted revenue, adjusted gross profit, new project awards and backlog. The Company believes EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure as it reflects the Company’s operating results and expectations of future performance excluding the non-cash impacts of depreciation and amortization. The Company believes adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure as it reflects the Company’s EBITDA adjusted to remove certain nonrecurring items (including the impact of insurance recoveries and costs associated with damage previously caused by Hurricane Ida and certain non-cash impairment charges) and the operating results of the Company’s Shipyard Division (including the impact of certain nonrecurring items related to the resolution of the MPSV Litigation), which was substantially wound down in the fourth quarter 2023. The Company believes adjusted revenue and adjusted gross profit are useful supplemental measures as they reflect the Company’s revenue, and gross profit or loss, adjusted to remove revenue, and gross profit or loss, for the Company’s Shipyard Division (including the impact of certain nonrecurring items related to the resolution of the MPSV Litigation), which was substantially wound down in the fourth quarter 2023. Reconciliations of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted revenue and adjusted gross profit to the most comparable GAAP measures are presented under “Consolidated Results of Operations,” “Results of Operations by Segment” and “2024 Financial Outlook – Segment and Consolidated EBITDA Reconciliations” below. The Company believes new project awards and backlog are useful supplemental measures as they represent work that the Company is obligated to perform under its current contracts. New project awards represent the expected revenue value of contract commitments received during a given period, including scope growth on existing contract commitments. Backlog represents the unrecognized revenue value of new project awards, and at December 31, 2023, was consistent with the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts as determined under GAAP. Non-GAAP measures are not intended to be replacements or alternatives to GAAP measures, and investors are urged to consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not in substitution for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company may present or calculate non-GAAP measures differently from other companies.

(VHI) reported net income of $3.9 million in Q4 2023 compared to a net loss of $9.4 million in Q4 2022. For the full year 2023, a net loss of $12.1 million was reported. The Chemicals Segment saw higher net sales but lower operating income due to lower TiO2 selling prices. Positive None. Negative Valhi reported a net loss for the full year of 2023 compared to net income in 2022. The Chemicals Segment experienced lower operating income in 2023 due to a combination of factors including lower sales volumes and higher production costs. The Real Estate Management and Development Segment's sales decreased in Q4 and full year 2023 compared to 2022 due to decreased development activity. Financial Analyst The financial performance of Valhi, Inc. reveals a mixed picture, with a return to profitability in the fourth quarter of 2023 contrasting with an annual net loss. The swing from a net loss in Q4 2022 to net income in Q4 2023 suggests a recovery trajectory, potentially indicating operational improvements or cost optimizations. However, the overall annual loss in 2023, as opposed to the significant net income in 2022, underscores challenges faced throughout the year. Investors should consider the volatility of the Chemicals Segment, which, despite increased Q4 sales, suffered a full-year decline due to lower demand and selling prices for TiO2, a key product.The reported unabsorbed fixed production costs reflect strategic adjustments to production volumes, which, while necessary to align with demand, have financial repercussions. The Component Products Segment's performance, particularly in security products, offers a counterbalance, suggesting diversification benefits. The Real Estate Management and Development Segment's decline in sales is concerning, yet the recognition of tax increment infrastructure reimbursement provides some offset.Key financial indicators, such as operating income and net sales, are essential for stakeholders to assess the company's health and future prospects. The impact of currency fluctuations, particularly the euro and the detailed breakdown of segment performances, offer valuable insights into operational efficiency and market conditions. The fluctuations in interest income and other financial gains reflect broader economic trends, such as interest rate changes, which have a direct impact on corporate earnings. Market Research Analyst The Chemicals Segment's performance is a critical factor in Valhi's overall results. The TiO2 market is influenced by global demand patterns, particularly in Europe and North America, which are primary markets for Valhi. The reported increase in TiO2 sales volumes in Q4 2023 suggests a rebound in demand, possibly linked to economic recovery or industry-specific trends. However, the decline in average selling prices indicates competitive pressures or excess supply. The full-year decrease in sales volumes across major markets suggests that the rebound is not yet stable and may be subject to further fluctuations.The Component Products Segment's increased sales from government security projects may reflect a growing market for security products, an area that could offer growth opportunities for Valhi. Conversely, the decline in marine components sales, particularly to the towboat market, could signal sector-specific challenges or competitive displacement.The Real Estate Management and Development Segment's decreased pace of development activity raises questions about local market conditions, regulatory hurdles and resource availability. The segment's performance is also indicative of the health of the residential real estate market, which can be cyclical and influenced by broader economic factors. Economist The reported financials of Valhi, Inc. reflect broader economic themes, such as the role of currency exchange rates in international business. The euro's fluctuation has a tangible impact on the company's Chemicals Segment, affecting both net sales and operating loss. This illustrates the importance of currency risk management in multinational operations.The strategic production curtailments in response to lower demand for TiO2 demonstrate the company's responsiveness to market conditions but also highlight the risks associated with fixed costs in capital-intensive industries. The ability to adjust production levels is crucial for maintaining financial stability during demand downturns.The real estate segment's results, influenced by development activity and land sales, serve as a microcosm of the real estate market's responsiveness to economic factors such as labor and material availability, regulatory processes and infrastructure investment. The segment's performance may also reflect consumer confidence and spending power in the residential market.Overall, Valhi's financials provide a window into the interplay between corporate strategy, market dynamics and economic conditions. The company's ability to navigate these factors will determine its long-term financial health and growth trajectory. 03/07/2024 - 04:15 PM Dallas, Texas, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Valhi, Inc. (NYSE: VHI) reported net income attributable to Valhi stockholders of $3.9 million, or $.14 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to a net loss of $9.4 million, or $.33 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year of 2023, Valhi reported a net loss attributable to Valhi stockholders of $12.1 million, or $.42 per share, compared to net income of $90.2 million, or $3.16 per share, for the full year of 2022. Net income attributable to Valhi stockholders increased in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily due to higher operating results from all of our segments. Net income attributable to Valhi stockholders decreased in the full year of 2023 as compared to the full year of 2022 primarily due to lower operating results from our Chemicals Segment. The Chemicals Segment’s net sales of $400.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $57.7 million, or 17%, higher than in the fourth quarter of 2022 and its net sales of $1.7 billion in the full year of 2023 were $263.7 million, or 14%, lower than in the full year of 2022. The Chemicals Segment’s net sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 due to the net effects of higher sales volumes due to strengthening demand for TiO2 in our Chemicals Segment’s primary markets of Europe and North America and lower average TiO2 selling prices. The Chemicals Segment’s net sales decreased in the full year of 2023 compared to the full year of 2022 due to the effects of lower sales volumes in all major markets and lower average TiO2 selling prices. The Chemicals Segment’s TiO2 sales volumes were 29% higher in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and 13% lower in the full year of 2023 as compared to the full year of 2022. Average TiO2 selling prices were 11% lower in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and 4% lower in the full year of 2023 as compared to the full year of 2022. Average TiO2 selling prices at the end of 2023 were 13% lower than at the end of 2022. The Chemicals Segment’s changes in product mix positively contributed to net sales, primarily due to higher average selling prices and sales volumes in its complementary businesses which somewhat offset declines in TiO2 sales volumes in the full year of 2023. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates (primarily the euro) also affected net sales comparisons, increasing our Chemicals Segment’s net sales by approximately $10 million in both the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 as compared to the same periods in 2022. The table at the end of this press release shows how each of these items impacted our Chemical Segment’s net sales. The Chemicals Segment’s operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.6 million as compared to an operating loss of $15.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year of 2023, the Chemicals Segment recognized an operating loss of $41.1 million compared to operating income of $174.6 million for the full year of 2022. The Chemicals Segment’s operating loss decreased in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to the net effects of higher sales volumes and lower average TiO2 selling prices. The Chemicals Segment’s operating income decreased in the full year of 2023 as compared to the full year of 2022 primarily as a result of the combination of lower sales volumes, higher production costs and lower average TiO2 selling prices. In addition, cost of sales in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 includes $22 million and $96 million, respectively, of unabsorbed fixed production and other manufacturing costs associated with production curtailments at its facilities during the full year of 2023 as the Chemicals Segment adjusted its TiO2 production volumes to align inventory levels with lower demand. TiO2 production volumes were 15% higher in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 but 19% lower in the full year of 2023 compared to the full year of 2022. As a result of reduced demand and scheduled maintenance activities, the Chemicals Segment operated its production facilities at 72% of practical capacity utilization in the full year of 2023 (76%, 64%, 73% and 75% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2023, respectively) compared to 89% in the full year of 2022 (100%, 95%, 93% and 65% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2022, respectively). Fluctuations in currency exchange rates (primarily the euro) decreased the Chemicals Segment’s operating loss by approximately $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and by approximately $16 million in the full year of 2023 as compared to the same prior year periods. The Chemicals Segment’s operating loss in the full year of 2023 includes an insurance settlement gain related to a 2020 business interruption insurance claim of $2.5 million ($1.3 million, or $.05 per share, net of tax and noncontrolling interest), a fixed asset impairment related to the write-off of certain costs resulting from a capital project termination of $3.8 million ($1.8 million, or $.06 per share, net of tax and noncontrolling interest) and restructuring costs related to workforce reductions of $5.8 million ($2.8 million, or $.10 per share, net of tax and noncontrolling interest). The Chemicals Segment’s operating income in the full year of 2022 includes a gain related to the 2020 business interruption insurance claim noted above of $2.7 million ($1.4 million, or $.05 per share, net of tax and noncontrolling interest). The Component Products Segment’s net sales were $43.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $40.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $161.3 million for the full year of 2023 compared to $166.6 million for the full year of 2022. The Component Products Segment’s net sales increased in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to higher security products sales related to a pilot project for a government security customer, partially offset by lower marine components sales primarily to the towboat market. The Component Products Segment’s net sales decreased for the full year of 2023 compared to the full year of 2022 due to lower marine components sales predominantly to the towboat market, partially offset by higher security products sales to the government security market largely in the fourth quarter related to the pilot project noted above. Operating income attributable to the Component Products Segment was $7.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $5.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $25.4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Component Products Segment’s operating income increased in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 due to higher sales and improved gross margin percentage at security products, partially offset by lower marine components sales and gross margin percentage. Operating income for the full year of 2023 was comparable to 2022 as lower marine components sales were offset by higher gross margin percentages across both the security products and marine components reporting units, primarily due to lower production costs, and higher security products sales. The Real Estate Management and Development Segment had sales of $9.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $20.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year of 2023 the Real Estate Management and Development Segment had sales of $93.9 million compared to sales of $125.7 million for the full year of 2022. Land sales revenue is generally recognized over time based on cost inputs, and land sales revenues are dependent on spending for development activities. Land sales revenues are also impacted by the relative timing of when new land parcel sales are closed. Land sales revenues decreased in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 as compared to the same periods in 2022 primarily due to the decreased pace of development activity within the residential/planned community. The pace of development activities is dictated by a number of factors such as city permit and design approval and labor and materials availability. Recognition of tax increment infrastructure reimbursement of $25.2 million ($13.1 million, or $.46 per share, net of tax and noncontrolling interest) in the full year of 2023 and $15.2 million ($7.9 million, or $.28 per share, net of tax and noncontrolling interest) in the full year of 2022 are included in the determination of operating income. Our Real Estate Management and Development Segment also recognized a loss of $2.6 million ($1.3 million, or $.04 per share, net of tax and noncontrolling interest) related to the sale of a subsidiary in the fourth quarter of 2023. Due to historically low water levels at Lake Mead, Nevada at the end of the second quarter of 2022, the Real Estate Management and Development Segment’s subsidiary Basic Water Company (BWC) ceased operations at its water intake facility and on September 10, 2022 BWC and its subsidiaries voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Nevada. The Real Estate Management and Development Segment recognized aggregate charges of $19.7 million related to BWC during 2022, including $16.4 million ($8.2 million, or $.29 per share, net of tax and noncontrolling interest), primarily in the second quarter, related to the impairment of the water delivery system fixed assets and, as a result of the bankruptcy filing of BWC in the third quarter, a $2.0 million ($1.0 million, or $.04 per share, net of tax and noncontrolling interest) loss on the deconsolidation of BWC and bad debt expense of $1.3 million ($.6 million, or $.02 per share, net of tax and noncontrolling interest) related to an intercompany receivable with BWC. These charges are all included in the determination of the Real Estate Management and Development Segment’s operating income. Corporate expenses decreased 6% in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily due to lower litigation fees and related costs. Corporate expenses decreased 5% in the full year of 2023 as compared to the full year of 2022 primarily due to lower administrative expenses. Interest income and other increased to $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $4.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $21.3 million for the full year of 2023 compared to $10.4 million in the full year of 2022 primarily due to higher average interest rates and increased investment balances. Our net loss attributable to Valhi stockholders in 2023 includes a non-cash loss of $6.2 million ($3.8 million, or $.13 per share, net of tax and noncontrolling interest) related to the termination of a United Kingdom pension plan and a gain of $1.5 million ($1.1 million, or $.04 per share, net of tax) on the sale of land not used in our operations; both recognized in the second quarter.

The company saw a 43% increase in net revenue compared to the previous year, along with significant improvements in adjusted EBITDA. Nephros attributes its success to streamlined operations, a focus on filtration solutions, and strategic partnerships. Positive Nephros reported a 43% increase in net revenue for the fiscal year 2023 compared to 2022. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations improved by 97% in 2023 compared to 2022. The company's growth was driven by streamlined operations, a focus on filtration solutions, and new partnerships. Nephros expanded its salesforce and warehouse space to support growing sales and improve delivery efficiency. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in net revenue by 43% for the year-end and 27% for the fourth quarter is a strong indicator of Nephros's growth trajectory. This growth is particularly notable given the competitive landscape of the water filtration market. The company's ability to leverage regulatory changes and expand its salesforce has evidently translated into significant sales increases. However, the reported net loss figures, despite being reduced from the previous year, suggest that the company is still in a phase of strategic investment, with operational improvements potentially leading to future profitability.The improvements in Adjusted EBITDA, showing an 89% and 97% increase for the respective periods, indicate a positive trend towards operational efficiency. This metric, often used to evaluate a company's financial performance without the need to factor in financing decisions, accounting decisions or tax environments, suggests that the underlying business operations are becoming more profitable. Investors typically look for consistent improvements in EBITDA as a sign that the company is on a path to sustainable growth. Market Research Analyst The emphasis on Nephros's operational improvements, such as the opening of new warehouse space and the extension of supplier production agreements, is critical for supporting sales growth and ensuring supply chain resilience. These enhancements are likely to have a positive impact on customer satisfaction and retention by improving delivery efficiency. In the context of the broader industry, companies that can effectively manage inventory and supply chain challenges are better positioned to capitalize on market opportunities and mitigate risks associated with product availability.Furthermore, the strategic focus on infection control water filters aligns with the increasing demand for healthcare solutions that address infection risks. The reference to ASHRAE 514 suggests that Nephros is aligning its product offerings with industry standards and regulatory guidance, which is crucial for adoption in healthcare settings. This strategic alignment with market needs and regulatory requirements is likely to support continued revenue growth and market penetration. Supply Chain Management Expert The operational improvements mentioned, such as the new warehouse space and the extended supplier agreement, reflect a proactive approach to supply chain management. These initiatives are essential for a company experiencing rapid sales growth, as they help to mitigate risks associated with inventory management and product availability. Efficient supply chain management is a critical component of a company's ability to scale operations and meet increasing demand.By focusing on supply chain optimization, Nephros is likely to see reduced costs and improved margins over time. The warehouse expansion is particularly relevant, as it addresses the challenge of significant inventory expansion, which is a common issue for growing companies. The ability to maintain an uninterrupted source of product through extended supplier agreements is also a strategic advantage, as it reduces the risk of stockouts and production delays that could otherwise impede sales momentum and customer satisfaction. 03/07/2024 - 04:15 PM Full-Year Net Revenue of $14.2 Million and Fourth-Quarter Net Revenue of $3.3 Million SOUTH ORANGE, NJ, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NewMediaWire – Nephros, Inc. (Nasdaq: NEPH), a leading water technology company providing filtration solutions to the medical and commercial markets, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Financial HighlightsFourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2023 Net revenue from continuing operations was $3.3 million, compared to $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, up 27%Net loss from continuing operations was ($0.7 million), approximately equal to the same period in 2022Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was ($0.1 million), compared to ($0.5 million) in the fourth quarter of 2022, an improvement of 89% Year-End 2023 Net revenue from continuing operations was $14.2 million, compared with $10.0 million in 2022, up 43%Net loss from continuing operations was ($1.6 million), compared with ($4.3 million) in 2022Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was ($0.1 million), compared with ($2.4 million) in 2022, an improvement of 97% “2023 was an exciting year for Nephros. With freshly streamlined operations and a refocus on filtration, we grew sales 43% for the full year,” said Robert Banks, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Additionally, new water management guidance, such as ASHRAE 514, has enabled our expanded salesforce to propel Nephros solutions to the front of the line within healthcare facilities. We believe our infection control water filters are well-positioned to fulfill the latest directive recommendations and serve broadened customer needs. “In my view, our ability to leverage the current regulatory landscape has been a significant driver of growth, as well as our active engagement of new partners and strengthening of existing relationships,” remarked Mr. Banks. “Further, we have enacted a series of deliberate and transformative operational improvements to our supply chain management and consolidated expansion of our corporate footprint. Among these improvements was the opening of our new warehouse space in the fourth quarter, which has enabled us to increase delivery efficiency while supporting growing sales and solving the challenge of significant inventory expansion. Another enhancement was the extension of our supplier production agreement, which helps ensure an uninterrupted source of product.” Mr. Banks continued, “I am very excited about the momentum we have built and am buoyed by the tailwinds created as a result of more stringent water safety standards along with heightened awareness of microbiological proliferation. I look forward to sharing future products, tools and key partnerships as they develop.” Financial Performance for the Fourth Quarter and Year Ended December 31, 2023Net revenue from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $14 million, compared with $10 million in 2022, an increase of 43%.

Adjusted EBITDA loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 was ($0.1 million), compared with ($2.4 million) in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA loss from continuing operations for the fourth quarter 2023 was approximately ($0.1 million), compared with approximately ($0.5 million) in the fourth quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2023, Nephros had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $4.3 million, compared to $3.6 million as of December 31, 2022, and remains debt free. Adjusted EBITDA Definition and Reconciliation to GAAP Financial MeasuresAdjusted EBITDA loss from continuing operations is calculated by taking net loss from continuing operations calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and excluding all interest-related expenses and income, tax-related expenses and income, non-recurring expenses and income, and non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization, non-cash inventory impairments, and write-offs, and non-cash compensation. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA loss from continuing operations to net loss from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the fourth quarter of the 2023 and 2022 fiscal years: (unaudited) 2023Three Month Period EndedAnnual 3/31/20236/30/20239/30/202312/31/2023Totals Net loss from continuing operations(306)(433)(182)(654)(1,575) Adjustments: Depreciation of property and equipment10 10 9 10 39 Amortization of other assets44 44 46 41 175 Interest expense1 - - 1 2 Interest income(12)(13)(11)(28)(64)Non-cash stock-based compensation319 194 149 390 1,052 Non-cash inventory impairments91 15 - 189 295 Adjusted EBITDA loss from continuing operations147 (183)11 (51)(76) (unaudited) 2022Three Month Period EndedAnnual 3/31/20226/30/20229/30/202212/31/2022Totals Net loss from continuing operations(1,561)(747)(1,250)(719)(4,277) Adjustments: Depreciation of property and equipment8 20 12 12 52 Amortization of other assets47 41 44 44 176 Interest expense7 6 4 3 20 Interest income(2)(1)(4)(7)(14)Non-cash stock-based compensation254 258 225 207 944 Non-cash inventory impairments49 59 665 773 Other non-cash items- (38)- - (38) Adjusted EBITDA loss from continuing operations(1,198)(402)(304)(460)(2,364) Nephros believes that Adjusted EBITDA loss from continuing operations provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to Nephros’ financial condition and results of operations. Management does not consider Adjusted EBITDA loss from continuing operations in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of Adjusted EBITDA loss from continuing operations is that it excludes significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recognized in Nephros’ financial statements. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA loss from continuing operations is subject to inherent limitations as it reflects the exercise of judgments by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining Adjusted EBITDA loss from continuing operations. To compensate for these limitations, management presents Adjusted EBITDA loss from continuing operations in connection with net loss from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Nephros urges investors to review the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA loss from continuing operations to net loss from continuing operations and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the business.

Topline data expected in Q2, 2024 with a plan to file NDA thereafter. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The completion of enrollment for Unicycive Therapeutics' pivotal clinical trial is a significant milestone, particularly for a company operating in the niche market of kidney disease treatments. The focus on Oxylanthanum Carbonate (OLC) as a new therapeutic agent for hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients on dialysis addresses a clear unmet medical need. The potential reduction of pill burden by a factor of four is a noteworthy aspect that could enhance patient compliance and quality of life. If the trial results are positive and lead to FDA approval, this could represent a substantial value proposition for Unicycive, potentially capturing a significant share of the multibillion-dollar hyperphosphatemia market.It's important to note that the clinical trial's success hinges not only on efficacy but also on safety and tolerability. The pharmacokinetics data will be crucial in understanding how the drug is processed in the body, which is particularly relevant for patients with compromised kidney function. For investors, the trial outcomes will be a critical inflection point, as positive data could lead to an uplift in Unicycive's valuation, while negative results could pose substantial risks. Financial Analyst Investors should closely monitor the upcoming topline data release in Q2, 2024, as it will provide significant insights into Unicycive's prospects and potential market impact. Should the data be favorable and the subsequent New Drug Application (NDA) be filed, this could act as a catalyst for the company's stock price. The anticipation of this event may already be factored into the current valuation to some extent, but the actual data release will likely cause volatility depending on the outcomes.Given the targeted multibillion-dollar market for hyperphosphatemia treatments, successful commercialization of OLC could lead to substantial revenue streams for Unicycive. However, investors must consider the inherent risks associated with clinical-stage biotech investments, including regulatory hurdles, competition from established treatments and the challenges of commercial scaling. The financial health of the company and its ability to sustain operations until the product potentially reaches the market are also critical factors for evaluation. Market Research Analyst The hyperphosphatemia market is currently served by several phosphate binders, but the promise of OLC to reduce pill burden significantly could disrupt existing treatment paradigms. Market research indicates that ease of use and patient adherence are key factors in treatment selection, which suggests that OLC's value proposition could be compelling to both patients and prescribers.It is also essential to assess the competitive landscape, including any pipeline products from other companies that could affect Unicycive's market share. Understanding payer dynamics, such as insurance coverage and reimbursement rates, will be vital for projecting OLC's market penetration and pricing strategy. The potential impact on treatment guidelines and the receptivity of the nephrology community to adopt a new therapeutic option are additional factors that could influence OLC's success. 03/07/2024 - 04:12 PM Topline Data Expected in Q2, 2024LOS ALTOS, Calif., March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Unicycive Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: UNCY), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing therapies for patients with kidney disease (the “Company or “Unicycive”), today announced enrollment has been completed in the open-label, single-arm, multicenter, multidose pivotal clinical trial with Oxylanthanum Carbonate (OLC). OLC is a next-generation lanthanum-based phosphate binding agent utilizing proprietary nanoparticle technology being developed to treat hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis. “The completion of enrollment in our pivotal OLC clinical trial is a critical achievement for Unicycive as we strive to bring an improved therapy to chronic kidney disease patients struggling with hyperphosphatemia,” said Shalabh Gupta, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Unicycive. “Positive results from the trial will provide the basis to file a New Drug Application (NDA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We remain on track with topline data expected from the trial towards the latter part of the second quarter of this year and plan to file the NDA shortly thereafter. We want to thank the clinical trial participants, investigators, and sites whose significant interest in OLC drove strong recruitment as we pursue the goal of improving treatment options in hyperphosphatemia.” “In this pivotal trial, we are looking to evaluate the tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetics of clinically effective doses of OLC in patients with CKD on dialysis. We believe the novel characteristics of OLC show its potential to be a best-in-class product to treat hyperphosphatemia by reducing the pill burden volume by more than 4-fold compared to the most prescribed phosphate binder. If approved, OLC will target the multibillion-dollar hyperphosphatemia market and will be a new potential therapy for physicians to administer to their patients,” added Dr. Gupta. About the Oxylanthanum Carbonate (OLC) Pivotal Clinical Trial The trial is expected to have 60 evaluable patients. Once participants are enrolled into the trial, they will go through a washout period for two weeks to clear their current phosphate binder from their system. Participants will initially be dosed at 500 mg of OLC three times a day (TID) and be titrated to a clinically effective dose that is defined as the dose required to achieve a serum phosphate range of ≤5.5 mg/dL. The maximum dose of OLC tested will be 3000 mg/day (1000 mg TID). As a reminder, all approved phosphate binders, including Fosrenol®, are administered on a dose titration schedule based on the control of serum phosphate. Once titrated to a clinically effective dose, participants will then be treated for four weeks to evaluate serum phosphate levels. The primary endpoint for the trial will evaluate the tolerability of clinically effective doses of OLC in patients with CKD on dialysis. The secondary endpoints will evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics. There is no statistical analysis required to demonstrate efficacy as bioequivalence to Fosrenol was previously established; and there is no other clinical trial required to submit an NDA under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. About Hyperphosphatemia Hyperphosphatemia is a serious medical condition that occurs in nearly all patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). If left untreated, hyperphosphatemia leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), which then results in renal osteodystrophy (a condition similar to osteoporosis and associated with significant bone disease, fractures and bone pain); cardiovascular disease with associated hardening of arteries and atherosclerosis (due to deposition of excess calcium-phosphorus complexes in soft tissue). Importantly, hyperphosphatemia is independently associated with increased mortality for patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis. Based on available clinical data to date, over 80% of patients show signs of cardiovascular calcification by the time they become dependent on dialysis. Dialysis patients are already at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (because of underlying diseases such as diabetes and hypertension), and hyperphosphatemia further exacerbates this. Treatment of hyperphosphatemia is aimed at lowering serum phosphate levels via two means: (1) restricting dietary phosphorus intake; and (2) using, on a daily basis, and with each meal, oral phosphate binding drugs that facilitate fecal elimination of dietary phosphate rather than its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream. About Oxylanthanum Carbonate (OLC) Oxylanthanum carbonate is a next-generation lanthanum-based phosphate binding agent utilizing proprietary nanoparticle technology being developed for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). OLC has over forty issued and granted patents globally. Its potential best-in-class profile may have meaningful patient adherence benefits over currently available treatment options as it requires a lower pill burden for patients in terms of the number and size of pills per dose that are swallowed instead of chewed. Based on a survey conducted in 2022, Nephrologists stated that the greatest unmet need in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia with phosphate binders is a lower pill burden and better patient compliance.1 The global market opportunity for treating hyperphosphatemia is projected to be in excess of $2.5 billion in 2023, with the United States accounting for more than $1 billion of that total. Despite the availability of several FDA-cleared medications, 75 percent of U.S. dialysis patients fail to achieve the target phosphorus levels recommended by published medical guidelines. Unicycive is seeking FDA approval of OLC via the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. As part of the clinical development program, two clinical studies were conducted in over 100 healthy volunteers. The first study was a dose-ranging Phase I study to determine safety and tolerability. The second study was a randomized, open-label, two-way crossover bioequivalence study to establish pharmacodynamic bioequivalence between OLC and Fosrenol. Based on the topline results of the bioequivalence study, pharmacodynamic (PD) bioequivalence of OLC to Fosrenol was established.

Enterprise is repurposing segments of its Gulf Coast midstream network to supply the terminals, converting parts of its natural gas liquids pipeline systems for refined products transportation. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The initiation of truck loading operations at Enterprise Products Partners L.P.'s new Permian terminal signifies a strategic expansion within the energy midstream sector. With approximately 900,000 barrels of storage for gasoline and diesel and a truck loading capacity of 10,000 barrels per day, this development enhances the company's logistics capabilities, directly impacting the distribution efficiency of refined products. The significance of this project lies in its potential to stabilize supply chains and contribute to price competition in the southwest United States, a region that the company has identified as historically underserved.By repurposing segments of its Gulf Coast midstream network for the Texas Western Products System, Enterprise is not only optimizing existing assets but also diversifying its service offerings. The conversion of natural gas liquids pipelines to accommodate refined products is a notable example of infrastructure flexibility, which could become a more common industry practice as companies seek to meet changing market demands. This strategic move could set a precedent for other midstream companies, potentially leading to a shift in how pipeline systems are utilized across the sector. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Enterprise's expansion into the southwest refined products market is a calculated effort to capture demand in a region with fewer competitive pressures. The company's ability to provide alternative sources of refined products is expected to exert downward pressure on fuel prices, which could translate into increased market share and customer loyalty. The long-term implications for Enterprise include not only revenue growth from new operations but also the strengthening of its market position in the face of fluctuating oil and gas prices.Understanding the broader impact, the TW Products System's completion could influence regional fuel supply dynamics, potentially benefiting local economies through lower consumer fuel prices. However, the extent of this impact will depend on various factors, including the pace of infrastructure completion, regulatory considerations and the responsiveness of the market to these new supply channels. Stakeholders, including investors and regional businesses, should monitor the progression of the remaining system components to gauge the full scope of Enterprise's strategic initiative. Financial Analyst Financially, the operational commencement of the new terminal is likely to be reflected in Enterprise's future earnings reports. The capital expenditure involved in repurposing pipeline systems and constructing new terminals is substantial and the return on investment will be closely scrutinized by investors. The company's ability to leverage its integrated network and deliver refined products efficiently could lead to margin improvements, particularly if the system operates at or near its projected capacity. However, it's important to consider the capital intensity of the energy sector and the time lag between investment and return.Moreover, Enterprise's stock valuation may be influenced by the perceived success of this project. If the company can demonstrate a clear path to increased profitability through this expansion, investor confidence is likely to rise. Conversely, any delays or operational challenges could have a negative impact on the stock's performance. As such, the financial community will be paying close attention to the execution of the TW Products System's remaining phases and the company's ability to meet projected operational timelines. 03/07/2024 - 04:12 PM HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Enterprise Products Partners L.P.

Evoke is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development of drugs to treat GI disorders and diseases. The company developed, commercialized and markets GIMOTI, a nasal spray formulation of metoclopramide, for the relief of symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis in adults.Diabetic gastroparesis is a GI disorder affecting millions of patients worldwide, in which the stomach takes too long to empty its contents resulting in serious GI symptoms as well as other systemic complications. The gastric delay caused by gastroparesis can compromise absorption of orally administered medications. Prior to FDA approval to commercially market GIMOTI, metoclopramide was only available in oral and injectable formulations and remains the only drug currently approved in the United States to treat gastroparesis.

Important Safety InformationWARNING: TARDIVE DYSKINESIA Metoclopramide can cause tardive dyskinesia (TD), a serious movement disorder that is often irreversible. The risk of developing TD increases with duration of treatment and total cumulative dosage.Discontinue GIMOTI in patients who develop signs or symptoms of TD. In some patients, symptoms may lessen or resolve after metoclopramide is stopped.Avoid treatment with metoclopramide (all dosage forms and routes of administration) for longer than 12 weeks because of the increased risk of developing TD with longer-term use. GIMOTI is not recommended for use in: Pediatric patients due to the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia (TD) and other extrapyramidal symptoms as well as the risk of methemoglobinemia in neonates.Moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C), moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/minute), and patients concurrently using strong CYP2D6 inhibitors due to the risk of increased drug exposure and adverse reactions. GIMOTI is contraindicated: In patients with a history of tardive dyskinesia (TD) or a dystonic reaction to metoclopramide.When stimulation of gastrointestinal motility might be dangerous (e.g., in the presence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage mechanical obstruction, or perforation).In patients with pheochromocytoma or other catecholamine-releasing paragangliomas. Metoclopramide may cause a hypertensive/pheochromocytoma crisis, probably due to release of catecholamines from the tumor.In patients with epilepsy. Metoclopramide may increase the frequency and severity of seizures.In patients with hypersensitivity to metoclopramide. Reactions have included laryngeal and glossal angioedema and bronchospasm. Potential adverse reactions associated with metoclopramide include: Tardive dyskinesia (TD), other extrapyramidal effects (EPS), parkinsonism symptoms, motor restlessness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), depression, suicidal ideation and suicide, hypertension, fluid retention, hyperprolactinemia, effects on the ability to drive and operate machinery.

Fiscal year 2024 financial targets include net revenue between $270 million and $280 million, Adjusted Diluted EPS between $1.80 per share and $1.87 per share, and Adjusted EBITDA between $48 million and $50 million. Conference call scheduled to discuss Q4 2023 financial results. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results by Willdan Group, Inc. show a substantial year-over-year growth in several key metrics, which is indicative of the company's robust performance. A 37.5% increase in consolidated contract revenue and a 25.1% increase in net revenue for Q4 2023, along with a significant turnaround from a net loss to a net income, reflect a strong market position and effective cost management.From an investor's perspective, the notable rise in Adjusted EBITDA by 48.2% for the quarter and 96.3% for the fiscal year suggests operational efficiency and profitability that could lead to a revaluation of the company's stock. Moreover, the increase in both GAAP and Adjusted Diluted EPS indicates enhanced shareholder value. The forward-looking financial targets for FY 2024 project continued growth, albeit at a slower pace, which could be interpreted as the company consolidating its gains in a potentially more challenging market environment. Market Research Analyst Willdan's performance, particularly the end-of-year program expansions contributing to higher revenue, suggests that their market offerings are in demand. The strategic positioning within their industry, possibly in energy efficiency or software services, appears to be aligning with current market needs. This is reflected in their record revenue figures and the optimistic outlook for 2024.However, it's important to consider the broader economic context. If the company's growth is outpacing industry averages, it could indicate that Willdan is capturing market share from competitors or benefiting from favorable market conditions. The guidance for the next fiscal year will be a key indicator for investors, as it will reflect management's confidence in the company's ability to sustain its growth trajectory amid economic uncertainties. Economist Willdan's financial results can be seen as a microcosmic reflection of the broader economic trends. The substantial year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability could be a result of the overall economic recovery post-pandemic, increased infrastructure spending, or sector-specific tailwinds. The company's ability to generate positive cash flow amidst such conditions is commendable and signals strong financial health.Looking ahead, the set targets for FY 2024, with a relatively modest increase in net revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, could be indicative of cautious optimism. It suggests that while the company expects to grow, it is also mindful of the potential economic headwinds such as inflationary pressures, interest rate hikes and supply chain disruptions that could impact its operations and margins. 03/07/2024 - 04:10 PM ANAHEIM, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Willdan Group, Inc.

About Willdan Group, Inc. Willdan is a nationwide provider of professional, technical and consulting services to utilities, government agencies, and private industry. Willdan’s service offerings span a broad set of complementary disciplines that include electric grid solutions, energy efficiency and sustainability, engineering and planning, and municipal financial consulting. For additional information, visit Willdan's website at www.willdan.com. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures “Net Revenue,” defined as contract revenue as reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) minus subcontractor services and other direct costs, is a non-GAAP financial measure. Net Revenue is a supplemental measure that Willdan believes enhances investors’ ability to analyze Willdan’s business trends and performance because it substantially measures the work performed by Willdan’s employees. In the course of providing services, Willdan routinely subcontracts various services. Generally, these subcontractor services and other direct costs are passed through to Willdan’s clients and, in accordance with GAAP and industry practice, are included in Willdan’s revenue when it is Willdan’s contractual responsibility to procure or manage such subcontracted activities. Because subcontractor services and other direct costs can vary significantly from project to project and period to period, changes in revenue may not necessarily be indicative of Willdan’s business trends. Accordingly, Willdan segregates subcontractor services and other direct costs from revenue to promote a better understanding of Willdan’s business by evaluating revenue exclusive of subcontract services and other direct costs associated with external service providers. A reconciliation of Willdan’s contract revenue as reported in accordance with GAAP to Net Revenue is provided at the end of this press release. A reconciliation of targeted contract revenue for the fiscal year 2024 as reported in accordance with GAAP to targeted Net Revenues for fiscal year 2024, which is a forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure, is not provided because Willdan is unable to provide such reconciliation without unreasonable effort. The inability to provide a reconciliation is due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting the subcontractor services and other director costs that are subtracted from contract revenues in order to derive Net Revenues. While subcontractor costs have increased recently, subcontractor costs can vary significantly from period to period. Subcontractor costs and other direct costs were 48.1% and 47.1% of contract revenue for the quarter ended December 29, 2023 and fiscal year 2023, respectively, and 43.0% and 47.2% for the quarter ended December 30, 2022 and fiscal year 2022, respectively. “Adjusted EBITDA,” defined as net income plus interest expense, income tax expense, stock-based compensation, interest accretion, depreciation and amortization, and gain on sale of equipment, is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure used by Willdan’s management to measure Willdan’s operating performance. Willdan believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows Willdan’s management to evaluate its operating performance and compare the results of its operations from period to period and against its peers without regard to its financing methods, capital structure and non-operating expenses. Willdan uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate its performance for, among other things, budgeting, forecasting and incentive compensation purposes. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s costs of capital and stock-based compensation, as well as the historical costs of depreciable assets. A reconciliation of net income as reported in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA is provided at the end of this press release. A reconciliation of targeted net income for fiscal year 2024 as reported in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2024, which is a forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure, is not provided because Willdan is unable to provide such reconciliation without unreasonable effort. The inability to provide a reconciliation is due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting the interest expense, income tax expense, stock-based compensation, interest accretion, depreciation and amortization, and gain on sale of equipment that are subtracted from net income in order to derive Adjusted EBITDA. “Adjusted Net Income,” defined as net income plus stock-based compensation, intangible amortization, interest accretion, refinancing costs, and tax benefit distribution, each net of tax, is a non-GAAP financial measure. “Adjusted Diluted EPS,” defined as net income plus stock-based compensation, intangible amortization, interest accretion, refinancing costs, and tax benefit distribution, each net of tax, all divided by the diluted weighted-average shares outstanding, is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS are supplemental measures used by Willdan’s management to measure its operating performance. Willdan believes Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS are useful because they allow Willdan’s management to more closely evaluate and explain the operating results of Willdan’s business by removing certain non-operating expenses. Reconciliations of net income as reported in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted Net Income and diluted EPS as reported in accordance with GAAP to Adjusted Diluted EPS are provided at the end of this press release. Reconciliations of targeted net income as reported in accordance with GAAP to targeted Adjusted Net Income for fiscal year 2024, which is a forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure, and targeted diluted EPS as reported in accordance with GAAP to targeted Adjusted Diluted EPS for the fiscal year 2024, which is a forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure, are not provided because Willdan is unable to provide such reconciliations without unreasonable effort. The inability to provide such reconciliations is due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting the stock-based compensation, intangible amortization, and interest accretion, each net of tax, that are subtracted from net income and diluted EPS in order to derive Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS, respectively. Willdan’s definitions of Net Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS have limitations as analytical tools and may differ from other companies reporting similarly named measures or from similarly named measures Willdan has reported in prior periods. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as contract revenue, net income and diluted EPS. Forward Looking Statements Statements in this press release that are not purely historical, including statements regarding Willdan’s intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations, representations, projections, estimates, assumptions, aims, plans or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, including statements regarding Willdan’s ability to capitalize on increased energy efficiency spending in large markets and expected benefits from its acquisitions. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this press release are forward-looking statements. It is important to note that Willdan’s actual results could differ materially from those in any such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from its expectations include, but are not limited to, Willdan’s ability to adequately complete projects in a timely manner, Willdan’s ability to compete successfully in the highly competitive energy services market, Willdan’s reliance on work from its top ten clients; changes in state, local and regional economies and government budgets; Willdan’s ability to win new contracts, to renew existing contracts and to compete effectively for contracts awarded through bidding processes; Willdan’s ability to make principal and interest payments on its outstanding debt as they come due and to comply with financial covenants contained in its debt agreements; Willdan’s ability to manage supply chain constraints, labor shortages, rising interest rates, and rising inflation; Willdan’s ability to obtain financing and to refinance its outstanding debt as it matures; Willdan’s ability to successfully integrate its acquisitions and execute on its growth strategy; and Willdan’s ability to attract and retain managerial, technical, and administrative talent.

The company achieved significant milestones, including growing premiums-in-force by 30%, reducing the gross loss ratio to 30%, and starting operations of a new insurance carrier. HCI Group also redeemed all outstanding preferred shares and completed a secondary common stock offering for $85 million. Positive HCI Group reported a pre-tax income of $54.2 million and net income of $40.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $38.8 million, with $3.22 diluted earnings per share. Consolidated gross premiums earned in the fourth quarter increased to $215.2 million, including $23 million from the assumption of policies from Citizens. Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased to $65.4 million in the fourth quarter, with a gross loss ratio of 30.4%. For the full year 2023, HCI Group reported net income of $89.3 million, with adjusted net income of $86.8 million. Net investment income increased to $46.2 million for the twelve months of 2023. Policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses decreased to $90.8 million for the twelve months of 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported pre-tax income of $54.2 million and net income of $40.9 million for HCI Group, Inc. indicate a robust financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2023, especially when compared to the net income of $2.7 million in the same quarter of the previous year. The substantial increase in diluted earnings per share (EPS) from $0.18 to $3.40 highlights a significant improvement in profitability. This surge in EPS is a critical metric for investors as it suggests a higher return on their investment. Additionally, the company's ability to reduce the gross loss ratio from 39.4% to 30.4% reflects improved operational efficiency and claims management, potentially leading to increased investor confidence in the company's risk management practices. Insurance Industry Analyst The decrease in premiums ceded for reinsurance from 42.1% to 30.9% of gross premiums earned is indicative of a strategic shift in the company's reinsurance program, possibly aimed at retaining more premium revenue. This could be a response to favorable market conditions or an improved risk profile. However, it is essential to monitor this closely as it may also imply an increased exposure to potential losses. The assumption of policies from Citizens, contributing $23 million in premiums, represents an aggressive growth strategy in the competitive insurance market and could impact market share dynamics. The reduction in policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of gross premiums earned suggests cost-efficiency measures that could enhance the company's competitive position. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the successful completion of a secondary common stock offering raising $85 million demonstrates market confidence in HCI Group's growth prospects and financial health. This capital infusion could support further strategic initiatives or strengthen the company's financial position. The reported increase in net investment income, partly due to higher yields on fixed maturity securities, cash and cash equivalents, aligns with the broader interest rate environment, which has seen a rise in yields. This increase in investment income complements the company's primary revenue streams and may contribute to overall financial stability. 03/07/2024 - 04:15 PM Fourth Quarter Diluted EPS of $3.40Fourth Quarter Gross Loss Ratio of 30.4%Fourth Quarter Pre-Tax Income of $54.2 million TAMPA, Fla., March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HCI Group, Inc. (NYSE:HCI), a holding company with operations in homeowners insurance, information technology services, real estate, and reinsurance, reported pre-tax income of $54.2 million and net income of $40.9 million, or $3.40 diluted earnings per share, in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with net income of $2.7 million, or $0.18 diluted earnings per share, in the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure which excludes net unrealized gains or losses on equity securities) for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $38.8 million, or $3.22 diluted earnings per share compared with adjusted net income of $1.6 million, or $0.06 diluted earnings per share, in the fourth quarter of 2022. This press release includes an explanation of adjusted net income as well as a reconciliation to net income and earnings per share calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (known as “GAAP”). Management Commentary “Several major achievements were accomplished since the end of the third quarter, including completing four assumptions from Citizens, growing premiums-in-force by approximately 30%, further reducing the gross loss ratio to 30%, and commencing operations of a new insurance carrier,” said HCI Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Paresh Patel. “We also redeemed all outstanding preferred shares from Centerbridge and completed a secondary common stock offering for proceeds of $85 million.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Commentary Consolidated gross premiums earned in the fourth quarter increased to $215.2 million from $183.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross premiums earned in the fourth quarter of 2023 include $23 million of premium from the assumption of policies from Citizens. Premiums ceded for reinsurance in the fourth quarter decreased to $66.6 million from $77.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Premiums ceded represented 30.9% of gross premiums earned in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with 42.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net investment income in the fourth quarter was $10.3 million compared with $7.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was attributable to higher yields on fixed maturity securities, cash, and cash equivalents as well as a higher cash balance. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the fourth quarter decreased to $65.4 million from $72.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The gross loss ratio in the fourth quarter declined to 30.4% from 39.4% in the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease is primarily due to the continued improvement in claims experience in Florida including lower claims and litigation frequency. Policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses in the fourth quarter decreased to $22.7 million from $24.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and declined to 10.6% of gross premiums earned from 13.1%, reflecting lower commissions and lower policy acquisition expense related to policies assumed from Citizens. Full Year 2023 Results For the year ended December 31, 2023, the company reported net income of $89.3 million, or $7.62 diluted earnings per share, compared with a net loss of $54.6 million, or $6.24 loss per share, for the year ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure which excludes net unrealized gains or losses on equity securities) for the twelve-month period was $86.8 million, or $7.41 diluted earnings per share compared with adjusted net loss of $47.5 million, or $5.48 loss per share, in the same period of 2022. An explanation of this non-GAAP financial measure and reconciliations to the applicable GAAP numbers accompany this press release. Consolidated gross premiums earned for the twelve months of 2023 increased to $765.5 million from $724.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. Gross premiums earned for the twelve months of 2023 include $23 million of premium from the assumption of policies from Citizens. Premiums ceded for reinsurance for the twelve months of 2023 increased to $269.6 million from $261.1 million in the twelve months of 2022. Premiums ceded represented 35.2% and 36.0% of gross premiums earned in the twelve months of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net investment income for the twelve months of 2023 increased to $46.2 million from $32.4 million in the twelve months of 2022. Results for the twelve months of 2023 included a $8.9 million gain from the sale of two real estate investment properties and results for the twelve months of 2022 included a $13.4 million gain from the sale of real estate investment property. Excluding real estate gains, net investment income for the twelve months of 2023 increased to $37.3 million from $19.0 million for the twelve months of 2022. The increase was attributable to higher yields on fixed maturity securities, cash, and cash equivalents as well as a higher cash balance. Losses and loss adjustment expenses for the twelve months of 2023 decreased to $254.6 million from $371.5 million in the twelve months of 2022. The twelve months of 2022 included $64.6 million of loss expense related to Hurricane Ian. After adjusting for this, the gross loss ratio for the twelve months of 2023 improved to 33% compared to an adjusted gross loss ratio of 42% for the twelve months of 2022 reflecting the continued improvement in claims experience in Florida including lower claims and litigation frequency. Policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses for the twelve months of 2023 decreased to $90.8 million from $105.0 million in the twelve months of 2022 and declined to 11.9% of gross premiums earned from 14.5%, reflecting lower commissions, the transition of business from United Property & Casualty Insurance Company and lower policy acquisition expenses related to the policies assumed from Citizens.

Financial Analyst The reported increase in Adjusted EBITDA to \\-0.4 million, nearing break-even, marks a significant improvement from the previous year's \\-17.6 million. This suggests that Rubicon Technologies is moving towards operational profitability, which is a critical metric for investors assessing the company's financial health. The substantial reduction in net loss by 72.5% year-over-year also indicates effective cost management and potentially successful strategic initiatives. Investors should note, however, that despite the positive trend, the company is still operating at a loss, which may affect its ability to invest in growth and may require additional capital infusions.Moreover, the growth in revenue by 3.3% coupled with a significant 90.6% increase in gross profit for the full year signifies not only an expansion in the customer base but also an improvement in operational efficiency. The expansion of the Adjusted Gross Profit Margin by 246 basis points to 10.4% for the full year further underscores this point. These improvements are indicative of a company that is not only increasing its top-line growth but is also becoming more adept at converting revenues into actual profits, a positive signal for investors about the company's future profitability prospects.

This is a strong move in the waste management and recycling sector, where long-term contracts can provide stable revenue streams. Additionally, the introduction of innovative features such as AI-driven modules to combat illegal waste disposal reflects the company's commitment to integrating advanced technology to maintain a competitive edge. This could potentially open up new revenue channels and improve customer satisfaction.Furthermore, the launch of Technical Advisory Services signals Rubicon's dedication to sustainability, which is becoming increasingly important to customers and investors alike.

Specifically, the Company calculates Adjusted Gross Profit by adding back amortization and depreciation for revenue generating activities and platform support costs to GAAP Gross Profit, the most comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted Gross Profit Margin is calculated as Adjusted Gross Profit divided by total GAAP revenue. Rubicon believes presenting Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin is useful to investors because they show the progress in scaling Rubicon’s digital platform by quantifying the markup and margin Rubicon charges its customers that are incremental to its marketplace vendor costs. These measures demonstrate this progress because changes in these measures are driven primarily by Rubicon’s ability to optimize services for its customers, improve its hauling and recycling partners’ efficiency and achieve economies of scale on both sides of the marketplace. Rubicon’s management team uses these non-GAAP measures as one of the means to evaluate the profitability of Rubicon’s customer accounts, exclusive of certain costs that are generally fixed in nature, and to assess how successful Rubicon is in achieving its pricing strategies. However, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate and use these measures differently or not at all, which may reduce their usefulness as a comparative measure. Further, these measures should not be read in isolation from or without reference to our results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the rules of the SEC because it excludes certain amounts included in net loss calculated in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, the Company calculates Adjusted EBITDA by GAAP net loss adjusted to exclude interest expense and income, income tax expense and benefit, amortization and depreciation, gain or loss on extinguishment of debt obligations, equity-based compensation, phantom unit expense, gain or loss on change in fair value of warrant liabilities, gain or loss on change in fair value of earn-out liabilities, gain or loss on change in fair value of derivatives, executive severance charges, gain or loss on settlement of the management rollover bonuses, excess fair value over the consideration received for SAFE, excess fair value over the consideration received for pre-funded warrant, gain or loss on service fee settlements in connection with the Mergers, other non-operating income and expenses, and unique non-recurring income and expenses. The Company has included Adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by Rubicon’s management team to evaluate its operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses. Further, the Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is helpful in highlighting trends in Rubicon’s operating results because it allows for more consistent comparisons of financial performance between periods by excluding gains and losses that are non-operational in nature or outside the control of management, as well as items that may differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which Rubicon operates and capital investments. Adjusted EBITDA is also often used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating and comparing Rubicon’s results to other companies within the industry. Accordingly, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as Rubicon’s management team and board of directors. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of net loss or other results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: ● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the Company’s cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments; ● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company’s working capital needs; ● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the Company’s tax expense or the cash requirements to pay taxes; ● although amortization and depreciation are non-cash charges, the assets being amortized and depreciated will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; ● Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items for which the Company may make adjustments in historical periods; and ● other companies in the industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than the Company does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

(NYSE: IOT) reported impressive Q4 revenue of $276.3 million, showing 48% year-over-year growth, and ending ARR of $1.102 billion, a 39% increase. The company's financial highlights include strong growth in total revenue and adjusted revenue, positive adjusted free cash flow, and a significant rise in customers with ARR over $100,000. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported Q4 revenue growth of 48% and annual recurring revenue (ARR) increase of 39% for Samsara Inc. are indicative of robust performance and significant market traction. The ARR, a key performance indicator for subscription-based companies, suggests a stable and expanding customer base. The growth in customers with ARR over $100,000 by 49% year-over-year is particularly noteworthy, signaling strong adoption among larger clients, which could lead to enhanced revenue predictability and lower customer acquisition costs over time.The shift towards a positive adjusted free cash flow is an important milestone for the company, reflecting improved operational efficiency and financial discipline. This is a critical factor for investors as it demonstrates the company's ability to self-fund its growth and potentially reduce reliance on external financing. The guidance for the upcoming fiscal year, projecting revenue growth of 27%-28% and a non-GAAP operating margin of 2%, indicates management's confidence in sustained growth and margin improvement. Market Research Analyst Examining Samsara's performance within the context of the Connected Operations Cloud sector, the company's impressive year-over-year growth outpaces many traditional software industries, highlighting the increasing demand for IoT and cloud-based operational solutions. The reported increase in GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins suggests that Samsara is not only growing its top line but also becoming more efficient in its cost structure relative to revenues. This efficiency, coupled with the positive outlook, may position Samsara favorably against competitors in attracting investment and furthering market share expansion.However, the reported GAAP operating losses, despite a reduction in GAAP operating margin losses from 40% to 34% year-over-year, underline the challenges that growth-stage companies often face in balancing growth and profitability. Investors should monitor how the company manages its operating expenses and whether it can maintain a trajectory towards consistent profitability while scaling operations. Economist The broader economic implications of Samsara's financial results are multifaceted. The company's performance suggests a healthy demand for technology solutions that enhance operational efficiency, which can be seen as a response to broader economic pressures for businesses to optimize resources. This trend is likely to continue as companies seek competitive advantages through digital transformation. The positive adjusted free cash flow signals that Samsara is moving towards a sustainable business model, which is beneficial for the long-term health of the economy as it supports job creation and innovation.Moreover, the forward-looking revenue guidance provides insights into the company's expectations in the context of the current economic climate. A projected growth rate of 27%-28% for the next fiscal year, despite potential macroeconomic uncertainties, reflects a level of resilience that may contribute positively to investor sentiment and the stock market, particularly within the technology sector. 03/07/2024 - 04:10 PM Q4 revenue of $276.3 million, representing 48% year-over-year growth, or 37% year-over-year adjusted revenue growth Ending ARR of $1.102 billion, representing 39% year-over-year growth 1,848 customers with ARR over $100,000, up 49% year-over-year SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Samsara Inc.

See the section titled “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for an explanation of non-GAAP financial measures and the tables in the section titled “Reconciliation Between GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. Financial Outlook Our guidance includes GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For the first quarter and fiscal year 2025, Samsara expects the following: Q1 FY2025 Outlook FY 2025 Outlook Total revenue $271 million – $273 million $1,186 million – $1,196 million Year/Year revenue growth 33% – 34% 27% – 28% Year/Year adjusted revenue growth (1) 29% – 30% Non-GAAP operating margin (3%) 2% Non-GAAP net income per share, diluted $0.00 – $0.01 $0.11 – $0.13 (1) Q4 FY24 was a 14-week fiscal quarter instead of a typical 13-week fiscal quarter. To enable comparability across periods, adjusted revenue and adjusted revenue growth rate are calculated by multiplying Q4 FY24 revenue by 13/14 to remove the impact of an additional week of revenue recognition in Q4 FY24. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance financial measures to corresponding GAAP guidance financial measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty and potential variability of expenses, such as stock-based compensation expense-related charges, that may be incurred in the future and cannot be reasonably determined or predicted at this time. It is important to note that these factors could be material to our results of operations computed in accordance with GAAP.

These statements may relate to, but are not limited to, expectations of future operating results or financial performance, the calculation of certain of our key financial and operating metrics, our market opportunity, industry developments and trends, customer demand for our solution, macroeconomic conditions and any expected benefits of our products, and our competitive position, as well as assumptions relating to the foregoing. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and could cause actual results and events to differ. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “goal,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “ongoing,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would,” or the negative of these terms or other comparable expressions that concern our expectations, strategies, plans, or intentions. You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved, if at all. Forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time those statements are made, including information furnished to us by third parties that we have not independently verified, and/or management’s good faith beliefs and assumptions as of that time with respect to future events, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this press release may not occur and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include our ability to retain customers and expand the Applications used by our customers, our ability to attract new customers, our future financial performance, including trends in revenue and annual recurring revenue, net retention rate, costs of revenue, gross profit or gross margin, operating expenses, customer counts, non-GAAP financial measures (such as adjusted revenue, adjusted revenue growth rate, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin, free cash flow margin, and adjusted free cash flow margin), our ability to achieve or maintain profitability, the demand for our products or for solutions for connected operations in general, the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, geopolitical tensions involving China, the conflict in Israel and Gaza, the emergence of pandemics and epidemics, and macroeconomic conditions globally on our and our customers’, partners’ and suppliers’ operations and future financial performance, possible harm caused by silicon component shortages and other supply chain constraints, the length of our sales cycles, possible harm caused by a security breach or other incident affecting our or our customers’ assets or data, our ability to compete successfully in competitive markets, our ability to respond to rapid technological changes, and our ability to continue to innovate and develop new Applications. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our filings and reports that we may file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This document includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP are included at the end of this press release following the accompanying financial data. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for financial information presented under GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures versus comparable financial measures determined under GAAP. For example, other companies in our industry may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance. In addition, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow do not reflect our future contractual commitments or the total increase or decrease of our cash balance for a given period. These and other limitations could reduce the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. We present these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing Samsara’s operating results through the eyes of management and because we believe that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to evaluate our business. Expenses Excluded from Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Stock-based compensation expense is excluded primarily because it is a non-cash expense that management believes is not reflective of our ongoing operational performance. Employer taxes on employee equity transactions, which is a cash expense, is excluded because such taxes are tied to the timing and size of the vesting of the underlying equity awards and the price of our common stock at the time of vesting, which may vary from period to period independent of the operating performance of our business. Lease modification, impairment, and related charges, and legal settlements are excluded because management believes that such charges are not reflective of our ongoing operational performance. Operating Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures Annual Recurring Revenue—We define ARR as the annualized value of subscription contracts that have commenced revenue recognition as of the measurement date. Adjusted Revenue / Adjusted Revenue Growth—Q4 FY24 was a 14-week fiscal quarter instead of a typical 13-week fiscal quarter. To enable comparability across periods, adjusted revenue and adjusted revenue growth rate are calculated by multiplying Q4 FY24 revenue by 13/14 to remove the impact of an additional week of revenue recognition in Q4 FY24. Non-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin—We define non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit excluding the effect of stock-based compensation expense-related charges, including employer taxes on employee equity transactions, included in cost of revenue. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of total revenue. We use non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations. Non-GAAP Income (Loss) from Operations and Non-GAAP Operating Margin—We define non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, or non-GAAP operating income (loss), as income (loss) from operations excluding the effect of stock-based compensation expense-related charges, including employer taxes on employee equity transactions, lease modification, impairment, and related charges, and legal settlements. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income (loss) as a percentage of total revenue. We use non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and non-GAAP operating margin in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and non-GAAP operating margin provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations. Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) and Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) per Share—We define non-GAAP net income (loss) as net loss excluding the effect of stock-based compensation expense-related charges, including employer taxes on employee equity transactions, lease modification, impairment, and related charges, and legal settlements. Our non-GAAP net income (loss) per share–basic is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Our non-GAAP net income per share–diluted is calculated by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents (stock options, restricted stock units, and shares issued under our 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan) to the extent they are dilutive. Non-GAAP net loss per share–diluted is the same as non-GAAP net loss per share–basic as the inclusion of all potential dilutive common stock equivalents would be antidilutive. We use non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share in conjunction with traditional GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Margin—We define free cash flow as net cash used in operating activities reduced by cash used for purchases of property and equipment. Free cash flow margin is calculated as free cash flow as a percentage of total revenue. We believe that free cash flow and free cash flow margin, even if negative, are useful in evaluating liquidity and provide information to management and investors about our ability to fund future operating needs and strategic initiatives. Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow Margin—We define adjusted free cash flow as free cash flow excluding the cash impact of non-recurring capital expenditures associated with the build-out of our corporate office facilities in San Francisco, California, net of tenant allowances, and legal settlements. Adjusted free cash flow margin is calculated as adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of total revenue. We believe that adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow margin, even if negative, are useful in evaluating liquidity and provide information to management and investors about our ability to fund future operating needs and strategic initiatives by excluding the impact of non-recurring events.

Such reorganizations are typically pursued to achieve economies of scale, streamline operations and potentially offer a more robust product to investors.From a financial perspective, the consolidation could lead to reduced administrative and operational costs. Additionally, a larger asset base can result in improved liquidity and potentially better negotiation power with service providers. Shareholders should consider the impact of these reorganizations on the expense ratio of the funds, as cost efficiency is a crucial factor in investment returns.However, the benefits must be weighed against the risks, such as the integration process and the possibility of changes in investment strategy or management. Shareholders are advised to review the proxy statement carefully, as it contains critical information about the reorganizations' implications on their investments.

USIC leverages Samsara Video-Based Safety, Panic Button, and Vehicle Telematics to enhance its safety program and gain efficiencies that can lead to timely service for its customers and reduced costs for the business. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240307814271/en/Samsara & USIC (Graphic: Business Wire) Twenty million miles of underground infrastructure connect the United States to the power, water, and communication services essential to every home and business. More than 12,000 USIC field service technicians operate across the nation, marking these utility lines to both protect and maintain this critical infrastructure and ensure public safety. USIC completes about 84 million projects annually, and demand for its services is growing as the U.S. population rises in rural regions and the government invests in new infrastructure projects. “USIC is accelerating the massive infrastructure expansion happening from coast to coast. Bridging the digital divide by bringing Internet services to rural communities, establishing new underground power lines so the lights stay on when a storm surges, and much more – this is all important work for our nation’s future,” said Richard Batelaan, Chief Operating Officer at USIC. “With the real-time data we receive from Samsara, we can do this work safely and effectively. Samsara’s technology is essential to keeping our technicians out of harm’s way and delivering the services our customers need to keep their communities running.” Protecting Thousands of Technicians with a Technology-Driven Safety Program USIC is on a journey to reach zero safety incidents and zero injuries. Its focus is eliminating at-risk behaviors, strengthening its Safe-Life culture, and equipping employees with new training and tools. Samsara Video-Based Safety enables USIC to better support and coach its technicians on the road through real-time incident detection and preventative in-cab coaching. In addition, footage from Samsara AI Dash Cams allows USIC to recognize outstanding performance and lower risky driving behaviors at scale. With Samsara Panic Buttons, technicians can alert managers of emergencies or compromising situations. In its pilot with Samsara, USIC reduced mobile phone usage by 92%, no seat belt instances by 85%, and rolling stops by 50%. “Increasing safety for our technicians behind the wheel is critical as crashes are the number one risk they face,” said Tom Karnowski, Vice President of Environment, Health, and Safety at USIC. “We evaluated other vendors but right off the bat, it was clear the safety improvements we could make with Samsara. Samsara’s platform interface is also a cut above the rest, it’s extremely user-friendly – even those with zero training sessions could navigate it easily.” Streamlining Operations to Increase Sustainability and Better Serve Customers USIC is invested in being a good environmental steward and is committed to sustainability in all aspects of its operations. With Samsara Vehicle Telematics, USIC expects to increase fuel efficiency across its fleet which means less carbon emissions in the atmosphere and lower fuel costs. In addition, USIC can improve vehicle utilization and customer service as a result of real-time data on the location of its vehicles and their maintenance needs. With its previous provider, this data was delayed by 20 minutes, causing unnecessary pauses in action. “For our customers, minutes and even seconds matter. Maneuvering our workforce to the right place quickly, especially during emergencies, means trust in knowing where people are, where they were, and where they can go next. That’s where Samsara’s strength as a unified platform comes into play,” said Karnowski. “With Samsara’s platform, we can see the bigger picture of what’s happening in our operations and make adjustments throughout the day. We’re excited to discover all of the improvements we can make with this level of detail at our fingertips.” “Real-time data from Samsara helps some of the world's biggest operators solve their most complex challenges,” said Lara Caimi, President of Worldwide Field Operations at Samsara. “USIC's ability to strategically innovate and deploy new technologies to better serve their employees and customers is remarkable.

Negative Net loss increased in 2023 compared to 2022. R&D expenses rose to $215.5 million in 2023. Collaboration revenue saw a slight increase from 2022 to 2023. Operating expenses for 2024 are expected to be high, with a significant portion allocated to non-cash stock-based compensation. Cash balance projected to decrease by the end of 2024. Financial Analyst The financial results presented by IGM Biosciences, Inc. indicate a trajectory of increased investment into research and development (R&D), with a year-over-year increase from $179.3 million to $215.5 million. This uptick reflects a strategic emphasis on advancing the company's clinical pipeline, particularly their lead product candidates aplitabart and imvotamab. The increased R&D spend, however, has resulted in a widened net loss, from $221.1 million ($5.32 per share) in the previous year to $246.4 million ($4.71 per share) in 2023. Despite this, the loss per share has decreased due to an increase in the number of shares outstanding, which may dilute shareholder value.From an investment perspective, the company's guidance for the fiscal year 2024 suggests a slight reduction in operating expenses and a modest increase in collaboration revenue. The projected year-end cash and investments balance of approximately $180 million, with runway into Q2 2026, provides a cushion for continued operations but also signals the need for careful cash management as the company moves forward with its clinical trials.The stock market generally reacts to such financials with caution, as the increased R&D spending without immediate revenue growth presents a risk. However, successful clinical trial outcomes could significantly alter the company's valuation, making it a speculative play for investors with a high-risk tolerance. Medical Research Analyst The clinical advancements of IGM Biosciences in developing engineered IgM antibodies are noteworthy, particularly the progression of aplitabart in a randomized clinical trial for second-line metastatic colorectal cancer. The focus on progression-free survival (PFS) as a primary endpoint is a critical measure of clinical benefit, as it indicates the length of time during and after treatment that a patient lives with the disease without it getting worse. The company's optimism regarding the enrollment and potential outcomes of these trials indicates confidence in aplitabart's therapeutic potential.Furthermore, the initiation of Phase 1b clinical trials for imvotamab in severe systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis and the FDA clearance for its use in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, suggest a broadening of the company's therapeutic scope. These developments could have significant implications for patients with these autoimmune diseases, as new treatment options are in high demand.However, the clinical success of these candidates is not guaranteed and investors should be aware of the inherent risks associated with clinical-stage biotechnology firms. The results of these trials will be pivotal in determining the company's future, both scientifically and financially. Market Research Analyst The strategic expansion of IGM Biosciences' clinical trial sites across the United States, Asia and Europe for its lead product candidate aplitabart demonstrates the company's intent to establish a global footprint in the oncology market. This geographical diversification can potentially expedite patient enrollment and facilitate market penetration in different regions upon successful drug approval.Moreover, the company's collaboration with Sanofi, as indicated by the expected collaboration revenue, suggests a partnership that could provide both financial support and strategic advantages in drug development and commercialization. Such collaborations are common in the biotech industry, often providing smaller companies with necessary resources and larger companies with innovative product pipelines.Overall, the company's financial guidance and pipeline updates provide a mixed picture. While the cash runway projection into 2026 offers some assurance of stability, the reliance on the success of ongoing clinical trials for future growth is a significant variable that could impact the company's market position and investor sentiment. 03/07/2024 - 04:10 PM MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IGM Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: IGMS), a clinical-stage biotechnology company creating and developing engineered IgM antibodies, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023 and provided an update on recent developments. “We made significant progress during 2023 in the clinical development of our two lead product candidates in therapeutic areas that we believe have the greatest potential to produce significant near-term value,” said Fred Schwarzer, Chief Executive Officer of IGM Biosciences. “Enrollment in our randomized clinical trial of aplitabart plus FOLFIRI and bevacizumab in second-line metastatic colorectal cancer continues to be encouraging, and we expect to expeditiously complete our target enrollment of 110 patients. If the control arm of this randomized study demonstrates the expected median progression free survival of approximately six months, we will be able to begin evaluating the benefit of aplitabart in enhancing progression free survival by the end of this year."" Mr. Schwarzer continued, “We also initiated two Phase 1b clinical trials of imvotamab in severe systemic lupus erythematosus and in severe rheumatoid arthritis. We are encouraged by the initial level of investigator and patient interest that we have seen in these clinical trials, and we are optimistic that we will be able to generate meaningful initial clinical data by the end of 2024.” Pipeline Updates Aplitabart (DR5 agonist) Clinical development of aplitabart advances. Enrollment ongoing in randomized colorectal cancer clinical trial. The Company continues to enroll patients in a randomized clinical trial of aplitabart, a death receptor 5 agonist, plus FOLFIRI and bevacizumab in second-line metastatic colorectal cancer. In addition to clinical trial sites in the United States, this study includes multiple clinical trial sites in Asia and Europe. This randomized trial is designed to assess the additional benefit of 3 mg/kg of aplitabart when administered in combination with the current standard of care treatment arm of FOLFIRI and bevacizumab, with a primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS).Evaluating 10 mg/kg dose in single arm colorectal cancer clinical trial. The Company also continues to evaluate a dose of 10 mg/kg of aplitabart in combination with FOLFIRI and bevacizumab in the treatment of later line colorectal cancer patients in its single arm combination clinical trial. The Company expects to complete enrollment of patients in this 10 mg/kg single arm combination dose cohort in the first half of 2024. Imvotamab (CD20 x CD3) Clinical development of imvotamab in autoimmune diseases advances. The Company currently has two Phase 1b clinical trials underway for imvotamab, an IgM-based CD20 x CD3 bispecific T cell engaging antibody: one in severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and one in severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These clinical trials are being expanded to include multiple U.S. and international clinical trial sites. The Company also received clearance in late 2023 from the FDA of its IND application for the use of imvotamab in treating idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (myositis), and the Company is currently making preparations to initiate this clinical trial. IGM-2644 (CD38 x CD3) Clinical development of IGM-2644 in autoimmune diseases to be initiated. The Company is currently making plans to begin clinical development of IGM-2644, a CD38 x CD3 T cell engager antibody, in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

The reported GAAP net loss of $5.6 million for the full year 2023, in contrast to the prior year's GAAP net income, indicates a significant shift in profitability. This shift is primarily attributed to lower flight equipment sales, which have a substantial impact on the company's revenue due to the high value of such assets. The delayed sales, expected to occur in the first half of 2024, suggest a potential rebound in revenue streams in the near term. However, investors should consider the volatility in flight equipment sales when evaluating AerSale's financial stability and future performance.Furthermore, the company's adjusted EBITDA of $12.3 million, a considerable decrease from the previous year's $87.4 million, reflects the impact of lower-margin sales and a softened cargo market. This metric, often used to assess a company's operational efficiency, indicates that despite the net loss, AerSale was able to maintain some level of profitability before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The decline in gross margin to 27.6% from 37.1% further corroborates the impact of a less favorable sales mix and market conditions on the company's profitability. Market Research Analyst The Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) granted by the FAA for AerSale's AerAware™ Enhanced Flight Vision System (EFVS) represents a significant technological advancement in aviation. As the first commercial EFVS system with a 50% visual advantage and a dual-pilot solution, it has the potential to redefine safety and efficiency standards in the industry. The readiness to deploy the AerAware™ system to a large existing market of over 6,000 Boeing 737NG aircraft could catalyze a new revenue stream for AerSale.The company's strategic feedstock acquisitions totaling $131.9 million, with an additional $72.0 million under contract, demonstrate a proactive approach to capitalizing on future market opportunities. These investments are poised to support the Asset Management Solutions activity in 2024, potentially bolstering future earnings. The growth in the Used Serviceable Material (USM) sales by 27.0% year-over-year indicates increasing demand for cost-effective, sustainable aviation parts, which could be a stable revenue source moving forward. Aerospace Industry Analyst The aerospace sector is characterized by long-term cycles and the timing of flight equipment sales plays a critical role in financial performance, as evidenced by AerSale's report. The company's decision to cease providing numerical full-year guidance reflects the inherent unpredictability of revenue timing in this industry, particularly within the Asset Management division. This change in approach underscores the need for investors to adopt a long-term perspective when evaluating companies like AerSale.The company's Technical Operations (TechOps) revenue increase by 11.3% (excluding flight equipment sales) suggests a robust demand for Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) services, which is a positive indicator of the company's service segment strength. As the commercial aviation recovery continues, the demand for MRO services is likely to remain strong, providing a more predictable revenue stream compared to the volatility of flight equipment sales. 03/07/2024 - 04:09 PM 2023 Full Year Highlights Revenue of $334.5 million GAAP net loss of $5.6 million Adjusted net income1 of $3.5 million Adjusted EBITDA1 of $12.3 million Flight equipment sales included four (4) aircraft and seventeen (17) engines during 2023 AerAware™ receives Supplemental Type Certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration; Company launches go-to-market activities Feedstock acquisitions of $131.9 million and an additional $72.0 million under contract Flight Equipment inventory available of $329.2 million which will fuel Asset Management Solutions activity in 2024 Technical Operations revenue up 11.3% (excluding flight equipment sales) showing underlying strength in both on airport and component MROs CORAL GABLES, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AerSale Corporation (Nasdaq: ASLE) (the “Company”) today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Nicolas Finazzo, AerSale’s Chief Executive Officer, commented, “The end of 2023 proved challenging as a large volume of anticipated flight equipment sales shifted into 2024, which substantially impacted our 4th quarter and full-year financial performance. As we regularly note, flight equipment sales fluctuate quarter-over-quarter and have an outsized impact on short term financials as the incremental revenue is realized after fixed costs have been fully absorbed by the rest of the business. These delayed flight equipment sales are not lost and are anticipated to occur in the first half of 2024, and we encourage investors to monitor our performance over a longer time period based on feedstock acquisitions and monetization.” Finazzo added, “Demand for AerSale products and services is robust, and inventory ready for sale has increased markedly in 2023 as evidenced by our underlying business performance excluding flight equipment sales. We expect this momentum to continue into the new year and drive improved results going forward.” Update on AerAware In early December, the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) issued AerSale a Supplemental Type Certificate (“STC”) for “AerAware™”, the Company’s revolutionary Enhanced Flight Vision System (“EFVS”) for the Boeing B737NG product line. This achievement marked the world's first commercial EFVS system to achieve a 50% visual advantage (over unaided natural vision) and the first large transport aircraft to be certified with a complete dual-pilot EFVS solution featuring a Head-Wearable Display. AerSale developed the AerAware™ certification program under license with The Boeing Company, which included access to necessary technical services, maintenance, and engineering data. Finazzo further added, ""Achieving a 50% visual advantage with our AerAware™ EFVS is an aviation milestone that redefines what's possible for flight safety and efficiency. This groundbreaking technology provides pilots unmatched situational awareness in all conditions and phases of flight. We believe AerAware™ will be transformative for our industry, enabling aircraft to operate with higher dispatch reliability and minimized diversions. We are grateful to our engineers and partners at Elbit Systems and Universal Avionics for their dedication to cross this important hurdle.” Following the certification, the Company launched its go-to-market strategy to address the more than 6,000 737NG aircraft in service that are applicable to the equipment. This follows months of customer demonstrations while the system was still in development and awaiting certification. To date, the Company has written proposals to five aircraft operators and continues to educate potential customers on the benefits of the AerAware™ system. Finazzo concluded, “We are very pleased with the customer feedback and engagement following the FAA’s certification of the AerAware™ system and look forward to collaborating with potential customers further as we work to secure launch orders for the system.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Results of Operations Loss from operations was $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 down from $9.1 million income in the fourth quarter of 2022, principally due to lower flight equipment sales. AerSale reported revenue of $94.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, which included $47.4 million of flight equipment sales consisting of five engines and one aircraft, which includes a 757 P2F converted aircraft. The Company’s revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $95.1 million and included $51.4 million of flight equipment sales consisting of six engines and three aircraft, which included one 757 P2F converted aircraft. Excluding flight equipment sales, revenue increased 7.6% year-over-year as strong commercial demand and improved feedstock continued to drive volume. As a reminder to investors and as evidenced by the fluctuations from previous quarters, the Company’s revenues will vary from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year based on flight equipment sales and therefore, progress should be monitored based on asset purchases and related sales over the long term. Asset Management Solutions (“Asset Management"") revenue declined 4.9% to $64.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 on account of lower flight equipment sales. Leasing revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased due to a lower number of assets in the leasing portfolio. Fourth quarter 2023 Used Serviceable Material (“USM”) sales improved 27.0% from the year-ago quarter driven by higher demand and availability of feedstock. Technical Operations (“TechOps”) revenue was $29.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an improvement of 10.0% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, which was largely due to a strong demand environment for MRO services as the commercial recovery remains robust. Gross margin was 25.9% in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 36.0% in the year ago period, driven by a lower mix of higher margin flight equipment sales, many of which slipped into 2024. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $25.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $25.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to higher aviation insurance and higher facility costs related to expansion initiatives at our structures, accessory, and on-airport MROs. Income tax expenses were $2.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $4.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. GAAP net loss was $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to GAAP net income of $9.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, mainly due to lower flight equipment sales. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $6.0 million, compared to $17.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA and margins reflected lower flight equipment sales. Please see the non-GAAP reconciliation table at the end of this press release for additional details on these amounts. AerSale recognized $2.6 million in non-cash or non-recurring expense in the fourth quarter of 2023 including $1.3 million in mark-to-market income related to the private warrant liability, $3.1 million of stock-based compensation, $0.3 million in facility relocation costs, $0.1 million in secondary offering costs and $0.4 million of stock-based compensation tax expense during the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding these non-cash and unusual items adjusted for tax, adjusted net loss was $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus adjusted net income of $12.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Diluted loss per share was $0.08 for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with diluted earnings per share of $0.17 for the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted for the non-cash and unusual items noted above, adjusted diluted loss per share was $0.02 for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.23 for the fourth quarter of 2022. Please see the non-GAAP reconciliation table at the end of this press release for additional details on adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Cash used in operating activities was $174.2 million, primarily due to increased investments in inventory of $168.6 million and a net loss of $5.6 million. AerSale’s continued investment in feedstock opportunities utilized most of the available cash as of December 31, 2022. AerSale ended the year with $136.9 million of liquidity consisting of $5.9 million of cash and available capacity of $131.0 million on our $180 million revolving credit facility. Full Year 2023 Results of Operations Loss from operations was $10.8 million in 2023, down from income from operations of $55.0 million in 2022 primarily due to lower flight equipment sales. For the full year 2023, AerSale reported consolidated revenue of $334.5 million, a decrease of 18.1% from $408.5 million for full year 2022. Full year 2023 included flight equipment sales of $137.5 million consisting of seventeen engines and four aircraft. Flight equipment sales were $222.5 million in the full year 2022 consisting of fifteen engines and twelve aircraft. Flight equipment sales may significantly vary quarter-to-quarter and AerSale believes the full-year analysis, rather than year-over-year quarterly comparisons, is a more appropriate measure of the Company’s progress. Asset Management revenue was $215.2 million in full year 2023, down 22.5% from $277.6 million in full year 2022 largely due to lower flight equipment sales, partially offset by increased USM sales. The USM business grew by 26.1% benefiting from growing demand for airframe and engine parts as airlines expand their USM parts consumption. AerSale expects USM sales to improve as the Company begins to monetize feedstock acquisitions acquired in 2023 and the availability of inventory ready-for-sale grows. Revenue from TechOps was 8.9% lower at $119.3 million in 2023, entirely related to the prior year sale of a 737 aircraft used for AerAware™ certification for $23.7 million. Excluding this transaction, revenue in the TechOps segment increased 11.3% as stronger demand and a robust commercial recovery drove volume. Gross margin was 27.6% in 2023 compared to 37.1% in 2022, which was primarily due to a lower mix of flight equipment sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $103.2 million in 2023 compared to $96.3 million in 2022 as the company continued to make investments in adding new products, capacity and capabilities. The Company incurred $12.1 million of non-cash stock-based compensation within payroll expenses in 2023, compared to $16.5 million in 2022. Income tax benefit was $2.1 million in 2023 compared to an income tax expense of $14.0 million in 2022. GAAP net loss was $5.6 million in 2023 compared to GAAP net income of $43.9 million in 2022. Adjusted for 12.1 million of stock-based compensation, recovery of inventory obsolescence of $2.7 million, $2.3 million in mark-to-market adjustment to the private warrant liability, $0.8 million in secondary offering costs, $0.4 million of stock-based compensation tax expense, and facility relocation costs of $1.4 million, adjusted net income was $3.5 million in 2023 compared to $63.6 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 was $12.3 million, or 3.6% of sales, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $87.4 million, or 21.4% of sales, in 2022. This decline was due in large part to lower 757 P2F aircraft from a softened cargo market and the timing of flight equipment deliveries that slipped into 2024. Martin Garmendia, AerSale’s Chief Financial Officer, said: “Lower overall flight equipment sales in 2023 and delays of planned flight equipment sales at the end of the year materially impacted our fourth-quarter and full-year results. While these transactions can be volatile and unpredictable, we are pleased that the underlying business continues to show strong resilience and momentum; and anticipate that our consolidated financial performance will improve substantially as we begin to close on delayed transactions and further drive ROI from feedstock acquisitions.” Change in Approach to Guidance The timing of the Company’s revenue and operating results is inherently challenging due to the large portion of revenue driven by the Asset Management division and especially as it relates to volatility in flight equipment sales. As a result, we are ceasing our practice of providing numerical full year guidance. We will continue to provide as much qualitative detail as possible about opportunities and outcomes expected over future periods. Our change in guidance policy should not be interpreted as a change in our bullish view about 2024 and future years performance which we are confident we can drive from the diversified AerSale platform.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release includes non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share. AerSale defines adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) after giving effect to interest expense, depreciation and amortization, income tax expense (benefit), and other non-recurring or unusual items. Adjusted net income is defined as net income (loss) after giving effect to mark-to-market adjustments relating to our private warrants, stock-based compensation expense and other non-recurring or unusual items. Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share also exclude these material non-recurring or unusual items. AerSale believes these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to AerSale’s financial condition and results of operations. AerSale’s management uses certain of these non-GAAP measures to compare AerSale’s performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses and for budgeting and planning purposes. These non- GAAP measures should not be construed as an alternative to net income or net income margin as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (each as determined in accordance with GAAP). You should review AerSale’s audited financial statements, and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate AerSale’s business. Other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, or adjusted diluted earnings per share differently, and therefore AerSale’s adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), or adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of Net Income, the Company’s closest GAAP measure, to adjusted EBITDA, adjusted Net Income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, are outlined in the tables below following the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.

Delek Holdings shows interest in purchasing up to $30,000,000 of the units. Truist Securities, BofA Securities, and Raymond James are the joint book-running managers for the offering. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The public offering by Delek Logistics of $120 million in common units represents a significant capital-raising event, which is expected to have implications for the company's capital structure and liquidity. The decision to offer a 30-day option for underwriters to purchase additional units up to $13.5 million suggests a proactive approach in securing additional funding, potentially to accommodate for over-allotments.From a financial standpoint, the use of proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under the company's revolving credit agreement is a strategic move to manage debt levels and improve the balance sheet. This could lead to a reduction in interest expenses and an improved debt-to-equity ratio. However, it is also crucial to consider the dilutive effect on existing shareholders, as the issuance of new units will spread the company's earnings over a larger number of shares.Delek Holdings' indication of interest in purchasing up to $30 million of the common units may be viewed positively, signaling sponsor confidence in the logistics partner's value proposition. However, it's important to note that this is not a binding commitment and the final decision by the underwriters and Delek Holdings will be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of the offering. Market Research Analyst Assessing the market dynamics, the timing of Delek Logistics' public offering could be influenced by current market conditions and investor appetite for energy infrastructure investments. The role of the joint book-running managers, Truist Securities, BofA Securities and Raymond James, is pivotal in marketing the offering and determining the pricing based on investor demand.It is essential to analyze the energy sector's performance and investor sentiment towards midstream operations to gauge the potential success of the offering. The midstream sector, which includes logistics and transportation services for the energy industry, tends to be less volatile than the upstream sector but is still subject to fluctuations in energy prices and demand.Furthermore, the impact of this offering on Delek Logistics' stock performance will depend on the market's perception of the company's growth prospects and the effectiveness of its use of proceeds. If the market views the debt repayment favorably and anticipates stronger financial health, it could lead to positive momentum in the stock price. Legal Expert In terms of regulatory compliance, Delek Logistics' adherence to SEC regulations by filing a preliminary prospectus supplement and using an effective shelf registration statement is a standard procedure for public offerings. The importance of these legal documents cannot be overstated, as they provide investors with critical information regarding the offering's terms, risks and the company's financial status.It is also noteworthy that the press release explicitly states that the offering is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy in any jurisdiction where such actions would be unlawful. This disclaimer highlights the legal intricacies of securities offerings across different states and jurisdictions and the necessity for compliance with the Securities Act of 1933.The potential purchasers of the securities must rely on the prospectus and prospectus supplement, which must meet the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act, ensuring that they contain fully disclosed and accurate material information. 03/07/2024 - 04:07 PM BRENTWOOD, Tenn., March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Delek Logistics Partners, LP (NYSE: DKL) (""Delek Logistics"") announced today that it has commenced an underwritten public offering of $120,000,000 of common units representing limited partner interests in Delek Logistics pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"").

(""Delek Holdings""), the sponsor of Delek Logistics and owner of its general partner, has indicated an interest in purchasing up to $30,000,000 of the common units offered in the offering at the price offered to the public.

Negative Net realized loss on investments of $17.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $4.8 million, or $0.12 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Increased total operating expenses driven by higher interest rates and financing expenses. Net asset value per share decreased to $13.50 as of December 31, 2023, compared to $14.22 in the prior year period. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Runway Growth Finance Corp. reflect a robust total investment income of $39.2 million for Q4 2023, with net investment income at $18.3 million. The key metric here for stakeholders is the net asset value (NAV) per share, which stands at $13.50, a notable figure for assessing the company's per-share asset value. However, this represents a decline from $14.22 the previous year, indicating a potential area of concern regarding asset valuation. Additionally, the dollar-weighted annualized yield on debt investments is exceptionally high at 16.9%, which may attract investor attention due to the higher returns on debt investments compared to industry averages.Investors should also consider the company's investment portfolio growth to $1.0 billion, suggesting a significant scale of operations. The low credit loss ratio averaging 14 basis points on a gross basis signals strong credit quality and risk management practices. However, it is crucial to scrutinize the increase in total operating expenses to $20.9 million, driven by higher interest rates and financing expenses, as this could affect future net investment income. The declaration of both regular and supplemental dividends for Q1 2024 reflects a commitment to shareholder returns, but the impact of such distributions on the company's capital structure and liquidity should be monitored closely. Market Research Analyst Runway Growth's strategic focus on providing capital solutions to late- and growth-stage companies places it within a niche market segment that may have unique growth trajectories compared to more traditional investment avenues. The company's investment activity, with eight new investments in Q4 2023 and a total of $259.2 million in fundings over the year, indicates an aggressive approach to portfolio expansion. This could signal confidence in the market's growth prospects or a competitive positioning strategy.One point of interest is the company's liquidity position, with approximately $281.0 million in available liquidity, which is a critical factor in its ability to sustain operations and fund new investments. The core leverage ratio has increased to approximately 95%, up from 79% in the previous quarter, suggesting a higher degree of borrowing relative to equity. While leverage can amplify returns, it also increases risk and stakeholders should assess this in the context of current market conditions and interest rate environments. Legal Expert From a regulatory and compliance perspective, the establishment of a Joint Venture with Cadma Capital Partners LLC is a strategic move that could diversify investment opportunities and spread risk. However, joint ventures also introduce complexities in governance and management that must be navigated carefully to protect stakeholder interests. Additionally, the share repurchase program indicates a management belief in the undervaluation of the company's stock, or a desire to return value to shareholders and such programs are typically well-received by the market.It is also important to note the non-accrual status of the loan to Mingle Healthcare Solutions, Inc., which reflects the company's proactive approach to risk management. Non-accrual loans are those for which interest income is no longer recognized due to doubts about collectability and this action may influence investor perceptions of credit risk within the portfolio. 03/07/2024 - 04:07 PM Delivered Total and Net Investment Income of $39.2 million and $18.3 million, Respectively Investment Portfolio of $1.0 billion Conference Call Today, Thursday, March 7, 2024 at 5:00 p.m. ET MENLO PARK, Calif., March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Runway Growth Finance Corp.

(OTCQB: BMNM), (“Bimini Capital,” “Bimini,” or the “Company”), today announced results of operations for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights Net loss of $4.9 million, or $0.48 per common share Book value per share of $0.81 Company to discuss results on Friday, March 8, 2024, at 10:00 AM ET Management Commentary Commenting on the fourth quarter results, Robert E. Cauley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “The fourth quarter of 2023 appeared to be the turning point in the current interest rate cycle, and may still prove to be so. As the quarter began in October, every sign pointed to progressively higher interest rates and Federal Reserve monetary policy remaining higher for longer. Not only did incoming economic data consistently exceed expectations – especially readings on the labor market and inflation – but projected Federal governments deficits and related borrowing needs were increased materially, fueling fears of even higher rates as the market was forced to cope with an increased supply of treasuries going forward. Third quarter GDP growth was initially reported at 4.9%, well above the level needed to bring supply/demand imbalances back into alignment and quell inflation. Market sentiment was very poor and risk assets all performed badly. This changed dramatically as we moved into November. The primary reason was the inflation data. While inflation readings were still above economists’ forecasts, they were none-the-less less falling and the 3 and 6-month annualized rates for both headline and core inflation dropped below 3% - and appeared headed towards 2%, the Fed’s announced target. Fed governor Waller stated that if the inflation data trend continued the Fed would likely lower rates soon. Finally at the December FOMC meeting the Chairman, at his post meeting news conference, strongly hinted the Fed was done raising rates and the focus of their discussions had turned to removing restrictive monetary policy. The incoming economic data showed evidence of softness as well. The market reaction to these developments was dramatic. Interest rates declined – by over 100 basis points in the case of maturities of five-years or more, and market pricing reflected approximately six 25 basis point cuts by the Fed by the end of 2024. Risk assets rallied strongly, and several sectors of the fixed income markets reversed year-to-date losses as of November 1, 2023, and ended the year with strong positive returns. As we enter 2024 the market has once again reversed and the data, along with the Fed, has led the market to expect three cuts at most in 2024, and those are much later in the year versus expectations back in December. “Orchid Island Capital (""Orchid"") reported fourth quarter 2023 net income of $27.1 million, and its shareholders equity increased slightly from $466.8 million to $469.9 million. The market conditions in the last two months of the fourth quarter described above led Orchid to report mark-to-market gains on its MBS assets of $205.6 million, exceeding realized losses on its MBS assets of $22.6 million and mark-to-market losses of $149.0 million on derivative hedge instruments. Bimini 's advisory services revenue for the quarter was approximately $3.1 million, a 6% decrease from the comparable quarter in 2022. Orchid is also obligated to reimburse us for direct expenses paid on its behalf and to pay to us Orchid’s pro rata share of overhead as defined in the management agreement. “With respect to the MBS portfolio at Royal Palm, we added to the MBS portfolio during the third quarter of 2023, increasing the market value from $84.9 million at September 30, 2023 to $92.7 million at December 31, 2023. In response to evolving market conditions during the quarter described above we repositioned the pass-through portfolio by selling lower quality spec pools with 4.0% coupons and redeploying the proceeds into similar quality spec pools with 7.0% coupons, albeit in larger size, thus leading to the increase in the portfolio for the quarter. While the portfolio was increased during the quarter, and the combination of portfolio interest and dividend income from our shares of Orchid Island increased 96% over the comparable quarter of 2022, interest expense on our repurchase obligations continued to rise and increased significantly from $402 thousand for the fourth quarter of 2022 to $1.178 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. As a result, net interest and dividend income for the quarter of $376 thousand was down slightly from $390 thousand for the same quarter of 2022. “Mark to market gains and losses on our MBS portfolio, hedge positions and shares of Orchid netted to a net gain of $0.6 million, and we recorded a net loss before taxes for the quarter of $404 thousand versus net income before taxes of $1.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. We updated our projected utilization of our deferred tax asset and increased the valuation allowance, resulting in a tax provision of $4.5 million and a net loss for the quarter of $4.9 million. “Market conditions so far in the first quarter of 2024 are less volatile than what we experienced through most of 2023, and 2022 for that matter. However, incoming economic data remains solid and public comments from various Fed officials consistently point to the need for continued diligence on the inflation front and we suspect we will not see interest rate cuts from the Fed in the near term. That being said, a continuation of current market conditions is desirable as it allows us to accumulate cash owing to our NOL’s and continue to grow our RMBS portfolio slowly over time.” Details of Fourth Quarter 2023 Results of Operations The Company reported net loss of $4.9 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023. Advisory service revenue for the quarter was $3.1 million.

We recorded a $0.1 million mark to market loss on our shares of Orchid common stock and unrealized gains of $2.6 million on our MBS portfolio. The results for the quarter also included operating expenses of $3.8 million and an income tax provision of $4.5 million. Management of Orchid Island Capital, Inc.

An effective duration of 2.508 indicates that an interest rate increase of 1.0% would be expected to cause a 2.508% decrease in the value of the MBS in the Company’s investment portfolio at December 31, 2023. An effective duration of 4.323 indicates that an interest rate increase of 1.0% would be expected to cause a 4.323% decrease in the value of the MBS in the Company’s investment portfolio at December 31, 2022. These figures include the structured securities in the portfolio but not the effect of the Company’s hedges. Effective duration quotes for individual investments are obtained from The Yield Book, Inc. Financing and Liquidity As of December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding repurchase obligations of approximately $86.9 million with a net weighted average borrowing rate of 5.56%. These agreements were collateralized by MBS with a fair value, including accrued interest, of approximately $93.1 million. At December 31, 2023, the Company’s liquidity was approximately $3.9 million, consisting of unpledged MBS and cash and cash equivalents. We may pledge more of our structured MBS as part of a repurchase agreement funding, but retain cash in lieu of acquiring additional assets. In this way, we can, at a modest cost, retain higher levels of cash on hand and decrease the likelihood we will have to sell assets in a distressed market in order to raise cash.

The safety profile, with all adverse events being ≤ Grade 2, suggests a potentially better tolerability compared to current therapies, which often have more severe side effects. The ability of TSCM-rich CAR-T cells to traffic to bone marrow and demonstrate persistence for at least 6 weeks could imply long-term efficacy, a crucial factor in treating RRMM. Medical Research Analyst The data indicating a 100% ORR in patients not previously treated with a BCMA-targeted bispecific T-cell engaging antibody could redefine treatment protocols for RRMM. This suggests that P-BCMA-ALLO1 may be more effective when used earlier in the treatment regimen. Moreover, the lack of need for bridging chemotherapy is notable, as it may reduce overall healthcare costs and improve patient quality of life during treatment. The exploration of higher lymphodepletion doses in the P-MUC1C-ALLO1 trial for solid tumors may lead to improved cell expansion and persistence, addressing a common challenge in CAR-T therapy for solid tumors. Financial Analyst The $30 million payment from Roche in Q1 2024, as a result of accelerated milestone achievements, is a positive financial indicator for Poseida Therapeutics. This collaboration, along with the reported revenues that increased significantly in Q4 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, reflects strong performance and potential for future revenue streams. The decrease in full-year revenues from 2023 compared to 2022 is attributed to the high initial license revenue in the previous year, which should be considered in the context of the company's overall growth trajectory. The cash position of $212.2 million and the projection that current funds will sustain operations into the second half of 2025 provide a stable financial outlook, potentially bolstered by additional payments from Roche or new business developments. 03/07/2024 - 04:07 PM Lead asset P-BCMA-ALLO1 Phase 1 clinical trial data presented at ASH 2023 demonstrated 82% ORR and favorable emerging safety and reliability profile Initiated clinical trial of Phase 1 P-CD19CD20-ALLO1, the Company's first allogeneic dual CAR-T program Allogeneic CAR-T data to be presented at AACR in April 2024 describing activity of P-BCMA-ALLO1 in BCMA-experienced patients and comparison of lymphodepletion needs in heme vs. solid tumor settings P-FVIII-101 gene therapy data presented at ASH and Company to host Gene Therapy R&D Day April 17, 2024 SAN DIEGO, March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Poseida Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: PSTX), a clinical-stage cell and gene therapy company advancing a new class of treatments for patients with cancer and rare diseases, today announced business updates and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. ""2024 looks to be a breakout year for Poseida as we build on the recent allogeneic BCMA clinical data presented at ASH, which demonstrated the potential of our high-TSCM allogeneic CAR-T therapies to offer effective, safe, and reliable treatment addressing unmet needs in multiple myeloma. We are able to achieve high levels of CAR-TSCM in our products because of our proprietary, nonviral technologies,"" said Kristin Yarema, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Over the coming months we are planning data readouts for each of our three clinical-stage CAR-T programs, all of which are manufactured at our own GMP facility and will discuss the latest progress of our gene therapy programs at our R&D Day in April."" Recent 2023 Accomplishments Cell therapy Presented positive data from the Phase 1 study of P-BCMA-ALLO1 in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) at ASH: In December 2023, the Company presented data from its Phase 1 study of P-BCMA-ALLO1 at the 65th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition. These early data support the Company's belief that TSCM-rich allogeneic CAR-Ts have the potential to offer promising product response rates, safety profiles, and rapid patient access which if confirmed could provide differentiation from currently available therapies, including autologous CAR-T therapies. The study used product from 6 different CAR-T lots produced from 6 different donors with data demonstrating:82% ORR in deep clinical responses, including sCRs and MRD-negative patients from off-the-shelf, allogeneic BCMA-targeted CAR-T in heavily pretreated patients receiving adequate lymphodepletion.100% ORR in those patients who were not previously treated with a BCMA-targeted bispecific T-cell engaging antibody.Favorable emerging safety and reliability profile, with all (100%) intent-to-treat patients receiving therapy with no use of bridging chemotherapy or other anti-myeloma bridging therapies and low incidences of CRS and neurotoxicity observed (all ≤ Grade 2).Preliminary data suggest that allogeneic TSCM-rich CAR-T cells traffic to bone marrow, differentiate to cell-killing effector T cells and persist at least 6 weeks, supporting the hypothesis of cell persistence at tumor-relevant sites.8 of 9 responding patients still in response at data cut off.Continued enrollment of P-MUC1C-ALLO1: The Company continued enrollment in the Phase 1 clinical trial of P-MUC1C-ALLO1 for solid tumors. Drawing from insights gained in allogeneic BCMA CAR-T, it is exploring various dosing approaches, including higher lymphodepletion, cell dose, and scheduling in the MUC1C program. Data from the allogeneic BCMA CAR-T program, presented at ASH, underscored the important role of cyclophosphamide conditioning dose in CAR-T cell expansion and persistence. Patients in arms receiving higher doses (500 mg/m2 and 1,000 mg/m2) demonstrated significantly elevated P-BCMA-ALLO1 levels compared to those in the 300 mg/m2 cohort. Consequently, the Company is assessing lymphodepleting conditioning regimens with doses exceeding 300 mg/m2 in the MUC1C program. Advanced programs within hematologic malignancies at all stages, in partnership with Roche, throughout 2023:Previously announced the expected acceleration of achieving milestones, resulting in the receipt of a $30 million payment in the first quarter of 2024.Expanded the protocol and continued to enroll patients in the Phase 1 study of P-BCMA-ALLO1, incorporating lymphodepletion learnings from ASH 2023.Continued site activation activities and initiation of enrollment for P-CD19CD20-ALLO1, the Company's first dual, allogeneic CAR-T for B-cell malignancies.Advanced research programs optioned to Roche (P-BCMACD19-ALLO1 for multiple myeloma and P-CD70-ALLO1 for AML).Developed and deployed manufacturing platform improvements to all programs that delivered higher and more consistent levels of cell expansion.Gene therapy Presented proof-of-principle data supporting P-FVIII-101 as a potential treatment option for Hemophilia A at ASH: New preclinical data presented at ASH demonstrated the capabilities of the Company's non-viral approach in providing stable Factor VIII (FVIII) transgene expression through genomic integration. Additionally, the data highlighted re-dosing, or titrating to efficacy, along with favorable tolerability data for this approach, including 52-week durability data in an adult Hemophilia A mouse model supporting sustained and robust expression.Anticipated Milestones P-BCMA-ALLO1: The Company plans to present data at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting in San Diego. At AACR, the Company will present data on a subset of recently enrolled patients refractory to initial BCMA targeting therapy.

Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 RevenuesRevenues were $25.0 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $10.1 million for the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to revenue earned as a result of a milestone achieved in the fourth quarter under the amendment to the collaboration and license agreement with Roche and increased activity under the collaboration, offset by a decrease in revenue related to Takeda due to the termination of its collaboration agreement in the third quarter of 2023. For the full year ended December 31, 2023, revenues were $64.7 million, compared to $130.5 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to initial license revenue recognized from the collaboration and license agreement with Roche, which became effective in the third quarter of 2022, offset by the revenue recognized related to the research services performed under the collaboration and license agreements with Roche and Takeda, including $8.9 million of previously deferred revenue recognized as a result of the termination of its collaboration agreement with Takeda in the third quarter of 2023. Research and Development ExpensesResearch and development expenses were $42.0 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $33.9 million for the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in preclinical stage programs and other unallocated expenses due to an increase in research collaboration activity, an increase in personnel expenses as a result of increased headcount, and an increase in clinical stage allogeneic programs, partially offset by a decrease in clinical stage autologous programs driven by the wind-down of the Company's clinical development activities for such programs. For the full year ended December 31, 2023, research and development expenses were $156.8 million, compared to $152.9 million for the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in preclinical stage programs and other unallocated expenses due to an increase in research collaboration activity, an increase in personnel expenses as a result of increased headcount, an increase in clinical stage allogeneic programs, and an increase in internal costs related to facilities and other expenses, offset by a decrease in clinical stage autologous programs driven by the wind-down of the Company's clinical development activities for such programs. General and Administrative ExpensesGeneral and administrative expenses were $8.9 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $9.4 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower insurance costs. For the full year ended December 31, 2023, general and administrative expenses were $37.4 million, compared to $37.5 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower insurance costs, offset by an increase in personnel costs due to an accelerated stock-based compensation expense in the first quarter of 2023 related to a one-time expense associated with the retirement of the Company's former Executive Chairman. Net LossNet loss was $25.3 million and $123.4 million for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, compared to net loss of $33.3 million and $64.0 million for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Cash PositionAs of December 31, 2023, the Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance was $212.2 million. The Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments together with the remaining near-term milestones and other payments from Roche will be sufficient to fund operations into the second half of 2025. Potential additional payments under the amended Roche collaboration and license agreement and/or potential additional business development could further extend cash runway.

Despite challenges, the CEO outlined strategic priorities for future growth. The company had available cash of $3.0 million and outstanding debt of $82.2 million as of January 2, 2024. The 2024 business outlook includes revenue expectations of $510-525 million, flat to +3% comparable restaurant sales growth, and other financial projections. Positive Total revenue decreased in Q4 2023 by 8.9% to $124.3 million compared to Q4 2022. Net loss was $6.1 million in Q4 2023, compared to net income of $1.0 million in Q4 2022. Operating margin was (3.7)% in Q4 2023, down from 1.3% in Q4 2022. The company had available cash of $3.0 million and outstanding debt of $82.2 million as of January 2, 2024. The 2024 business outlook includes revenue expectations of $510-525 million, flat to +3% comparable restaurant sales growth, and other financial projections. Negative Total revenue decreased in both Q4 2023 and FY 2023 compared to the previous year. Net loss increased in FY 2023 compared to FY 2022. Operating margin was negative in both Q4 2023 and FY 2023. The company's available cash is relatively low compared to outstanding debt. Financial Analyst The financial results reported by Noodles & Company indicate a contraction in both quarterly and annual revenue, with a notable shift from a net income position to a net loss. This transition, particularly the reported 8.9% decrease in total revenue for the fourth quarter and the overall net loss for the fiscal year, suggests a challenging operating environment for the company. The decrease in comparable restaurant sales system-wide signals potential issues in customer retention and attraction, which is concerning for investors as it reflects directly on the company's core business performance.Operating margin contraction from 1.3% to (3.7)% and the widening net loss year-over-year from $3.3 million to $9.9 million are critical metrics that underline the need for operational efficiency and cost management. The decrease in restaurant contribution margin by 50 basis points in the fourth quarter, despite a 100 basis points increase over the fiscal year, points to increasing costs or decreasing sales in the latter part of the year, which could be a red flag for potential investors.However, the company's business outlook for 2024, projecting total revenue growth and an increase in restaurant level contribution margins, suggests an anticipated recovery. The focus on strategic priorities such as operational excellence, menu transformation, catering business growth, digital capabilities enhancement and financial fortification is intended to drive long-term profitability. This forward-looking statement, though, comes with its own set of uncertainties, as indicated by the company's caution regarding the predictability of certain financial measures. Market Research Analyst The performance of Noodles & Company reflects broader trends in the fast-casual dining sector, where consumer preferences and competitive dynamics are in constant flux. The reported decrease in comparable restaurant sales is indicative of the intense competition and potentially shifting consumer tastes within the industry. The company's strategic focus on a 'contemporary comfort kitchen' identity and the enhancement of digital capabilities align with current industry trends towards niche branding and increased technological integration for customer engagement.The company's emphasis on digital menu boards, customer data platforms and a rewards program is particularly relevant in an industry increasingly driven by personalized marketing and customer loyalty initiatives. The strategic pivot to fortify the financial position by reducing capital expenditures and researching lower-cost restaurant prototypes suggests a response to the necessity for agility in capital management and a possible reevaluation of expansion strategies in the face of uncertain market conditions.For investors, the company's strategic initiatives and the business outlook for 2024 will be critical to monitor, as they will play a significant role in determining the company's ability to reverse the negative trends and capitalize on market opportunities. The planned new restaurant openings, despite the reduced pace, indicate a cautious optimism and a continued commitment to growth. Legal Expert The mention of non-GAAP financial measures in Noodles & Company's report requires careful consideration. Non-GAAP measures, such as restaurant contribution margin, can provide valuable insights into a company's operational performance by excluding certain items that can obscure underlying trends. However, these measures lack standardization, making it difficult to compare across different companies. The company's statement that a quantitative reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP cannot be made without unreasonable efforts implies significant uncertainties and potential variability in future financial results.Investors should be aware of the limitations of non-GAAP measures as they do not replace the importance of GAAP measures. Furthermore, the forward-looking statements regarding the company's business outlook are subject to risks and uncertainties that could materially affect actual results. It is essential for investors to consider the legal and regulatory environment surrounding financial reporting and the implications of relying on adjusted financial metrics when making investment decisions. 03/07/2024 - 04:06 PM BROOMFIELD, Colo., March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Noodles & Company (Nasdaq: NDLS) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 2, 2024, and provided a 2024 business outlook.

A reconciliation of operating income (loss) to restaurant contribution is included in the accompanying financial data. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Drew Madsen, Chief Executive Officer of Noodles & Company, remarked, “Despite our recent challenges, we believe Noodles is a differentiated brand with an opportunity to be a robust business going forward. We are focused on five strategic priorities to capture this opportunity. Our first area of focus is strengthening operational excellence, with an increased focus on the dimensions of our guest experience that correlate most strongly with traffic growth. Second, a multi-phase menu transformation to stimulate increased guest desire that reflects our new culinary identity of “contemporary comfort kitchen.” Third, building a long-term strategy for growing our catering business. Fourth, leveraging our digital capabilities including our new digital menu boards, customer data platform, the Noodles app and the rewards program to grow our guest base and deliver personalized, targeted marketing. Finally, fortifying our financial position by reducing capital expenditures, slowing new unit growth, researching lower cost restaurant prototypes and capturing increased efficiencies across the business. We believe that focusing on these priorities will allow the brand to resonate with our guests and lead to sustainable long-term, top-line momentum and profitable growth.” Liquidity Update As of January 2, 2024, the Company had available cash and cash equivalents of $3.0 million and outstanding debt of $82.2 million. As of January 2, 2024, the Company had $39.9 million available for future borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Business Outlook The Company is providing the following expectations for the full fiscal year 2024: Total revenue of $510 million to $525 million, including flat to +3% comparable restaurant sales growth;Restaurant level contribution margins of 14% to 15%;General and administrative expenses of $52 million to $55 million, inclusive of stock-based compensation expense of approximately $6 million;Depreciation and amortization of $32 million to $34 million;Net interest expense of $8 million to $9 million;New restaurant openings: 10-12 company-owned and up to 3 franchise-owned; andCapital expenditures of $28 million to $32 million. The Company believes that a quantitative reconciliation of the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures guidance to the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP cannot be made available without unreasonable efforts. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures would require the Company to provide guidance for various reconciling items that are outside of the Company’s control and cannot be reasonably predicted due to the fact that these items could vary significantly from period to period. A reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures would also require the Company to predict the timing and likelihood of outcomes that determine future impairments and the tax benefit thereof. None of these measures, nor their probable significance, can be reliably quantified. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical financial measures, as discussed below in the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” In addition, the guidance with respect to non-GAAP financial measures is a forward-looking statement, which by its nature involves risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s forward-looking statement, as discussed below in the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements.” Key Definitions Average Unit Volumes — represent the average annualized sales of all company-owned restaurants for a given time period. AUVs are calculated by dividing restaurant revenue by the number of operating days within each time period and multiplying by the number of operating days we have in a typical year. Based on this calculation, temporarily closed restaurants are excluded from the definition of AUV, however restaurants with temporarily reduced operating hours are included. This measurement allows management to assess changes in consumer traffic and per person spending patterns at our restaurants. In addition to the factors that impact comparable restaurant sales, AUVs can be further impacted by effective real estate site selection and maturity and trends within new markets. Comparable Restaurant Sales — represents year-over-year sales comparisons for the comparable restaurant base open for at least 18 full periods. This measure highlights performance of existing restaurants, as the impact of new restaurant openings is excluded. Changes in comparable restaurant sales are generated by changes in traffic, which we calculate as the number of entrées sold and changes in per-person spend, calculated as sales divided by traffic. Restaurants that were temporarily closed or operating at reduced hours or dining capacity due to the COVID-19 pandemic remained in comparable restaurant sales. Restaurant Contribution and Restaurant Contribution Margin — restaurant contribution represents restaurant revenue less restaurant operating costs, which are costs of sales, labor, occupancy and other restaurant operating items. Restaurant contribution margin represents restaurant contribution as a percentage of restaurant revenue. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are presented because they are widely-used metrics within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-level productivity, efficiency and performance. Management also uses restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin as metrics to evaluate the profitability of incremental sales at our restaurants, restaurant performance across periods, and restaurant financial performance compared with competitors. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA — EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, restaurant impairments, loss on disposal of assets, net lease exit costs (benefits), loss on sale of restaurants, severance and executive transition costs and stock-based compensation. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented because: (i) management believes they are useful measures for investors to assess the operating performance of our business without the effect of non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization expenses and restaurant impairments, asset disposals and closure costs, and (ii) management uses them internally as a benchmark for certain of our cash incentive plans and to evaluate our operating performance or compare performance to that of competitors. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. Adjusted Net Income (Loss) — represents net income (loss) before restaurant impairments, net lease exit costs (benefits), loss on sale of restaurants, severance and executive transition costs and loss on debt modifications and the tax effects of such adjustments. Adjusted net income (loss) is presented because management believes it helps convey supplemental information to investors regarding the Company’s performance, excluding the impact of special items that affect the comparability of results in past quarters and expected results in future quarters. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. Conference Call Noodles & Company will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 financial results on Thursday, March 7, 2024 at 4:30 p.m. EST. The conference call can be accessed live by registering here. While not required, it is recommended that you join 10 minutes prior to the event start time. The conference call will also be webcast live from the Company’s corporate website at investor.noodles.com, under the “Events & Presentations” page. An archive of the webcast will be available at the same location on the corporate website shortly after the call has concluded. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement its condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted earnings (loss) per share, restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin (collectively, the “non-GAAP financial measures”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or to be superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. However, the Company recognizes that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical financial measures. The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using non-GAAP metrics only supplementally. There are numerous of these limitations, including that: adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the Company’s capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, associated with our indebtedness; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect depreciation and amortization, which are non-cash charges, although the assets being depreciated and amortized will likely have to be replaced in the future, and do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the cost of stock-based compensation; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; adjusted net income (loss) does not reflect cash expenditures, or future requirements, for lease termination payments and certain other expenses associated with reduced new restaurant development; and restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are not reflective of the underlying performance of our business because corporate-level expenses are excluded from these measures. When analyzing the Company’s operating performance, investors should not consider non-GAAP financial metrics in isolation or as substitutes for net income (loss) or cash flow from operations, or other statement of operations or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company in this press release may be different from the measures used by other companies. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results” tables in this press release. These accompanying tables have more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.

Adjusted EBITDA as previously reported was $9.9 million and $33.1 million for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended 2022, respectively. (2) Restaurant impairments in all periods presented above include amounts related to restaurants previously impaired. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or cash flow from operations, as determined by GAAP, and our calculation thereof may not be comparable to that reported by other companies. These measures are presented because we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by including these non-GAAP financial measures as a reasonable basis for evaluating our ongoing results of operations. EBITDA is calculated as net income (loss) before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA to reflect the eliminations shown in the table above. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are presented because: (i) we believe they are useful measures for investors to assess the operating performance of our business without the effect of non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization expenses and restaurant impairments, loss on disposal of assets, net lease exit costs (benefits), loss on sale of restaurants and (ii) we use adjusted EBITDA internally as a benchmark for certain of our cash incentive plans and to evaluate our operating performance or compare our performance to that of our competitors. The use of adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance relative to our performance based on our GAAP results, while isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. Companies within our industry exhibit significant variations with respect to capital structures and cost of capital (which affect interest expense and income tax rates) and differences in book depreciation of property, plant and equipment (which affect relative depreciation expense), including significant differences in the depreciable lives of similar assets among various companies. Our management believes that adjusted EBITDA facilitates company-to-company comparisons within our industry by eliminating some of these foregoing variations. Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies, and our presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by excluded or unusual items.

We define adjusted net income (loss) as net income (loss) before restaurant impairments, net lease exit costs (benefits), loss on sale of restaurants, severance and executive transition costs and loss on debt modification, and the tax effects of such adjustments. Adjusted net income (loss) is presented because management believes it helps convey supplemental information to investors regarding our performance, excluding the impact of special items that affect the comparability of results in past quarters to expected results in future quarters. Adjusted net income (loss) as presented may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies, and our presentation of adjusted net income (loss) should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by excluded or unusual items. Our management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to analyze changes in our underlying business from quarter to quarter based on comparable financial results. (1) Amounts for fiscal quarter and year 2022 include modifications to the adjusted net income (loss) calculation to conform to the current year presentation. Adjusted net income (loss) as previously reported was $1.3 million and $(0.5) million for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended 2022, respectively. (2) Restaurant impairments in all periods presented above include amounts related to restaurants previously impaired.

Restaurant contribution margin represents restaurant contribution as a percentage of restaurant revenue. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are non-GAAP measures that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP, and the calculations thereof may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. These measures are supplemental measures of the operating performance of our restaurants and are not reflective of the underlying performance of our business because corporate-level expenses are excluded from these measures. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Management does not consider these measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. However, management believes that restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are important tools for investors and other interested parties because they are widely-used metrics within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-level productivity, efficiency and performance. Management also uses these measures as metrics to evaluate the profitability of incremental sales at our restaurants, restaurant performance across periods, and restaurant financial performance compared with competitors.

The company's management team will decide the extent and timing of stock repurchases based on market conditions and other corporate factors. Marvell's proactive approach to capital allocation through stock repurchases showcases a commitment to enhancing shareholder returns. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Marvell Technology of a $3 billion addition to its stock repurchase program is a significant event that warrants a closer look from a financial perspective. Share repurchase programs are often viewed positively by the market as they can indicate that a company's management believes its shares are undervalued. In this case, the size of the authorization, being the largest in the company's history, could signal strong confidence from the management in the company's future prospects.From a financial standpoint, repurchasing shares can be beneficial as it reduces the number of outstanding shares, potentially increasing earnings per share (EPS) and the intrinsic value of the remaining shares. However, it is essential to consider the opportunity cost of such a large capital allocation. The decision to repurchase shares rather than invest in growth or pay down debt may raise questions about the company's available high-return investment opportunities.Moreover, the timing and extent of the repurchases are subject to market conditions, which adds an element of uncertainty. If executed properly, the buyback could provide support for the stock price in the short-term, but the long-term impact will largely depend on the company's ongoing performance and its ability to generate shareholder value. Market Research Analyst Marvell Technology's strategic move to increase its repurchase authority significantly can also be interpreted through the lens of market sentiment and competitive positioning. In the data infrastructure semiconductor sector, stock repurchases might convey a message to competitors and investors about the company's financial health and stability.It's important to consider the broader industry context when evaluating this decision. If peers in the sector are not engaging in similar levels of capital return to shareholders, Marvell's action could set it apart and potentially attract more investors looking for companies demonstrating shareholder-friendly activities. On the other hand, if the industry is witnessing a trend towards large repurchases or dividends, Marvell's decision may be following an industry norm rather than setting a precedent.Additionally, the repurchase program's impact on the company's market capitalization and liquidity should be monitored. A reduced share count could lead to higher stock volatility due to a lower number of shares available for trading. This could affect the stock's attractiveness to institutional investors who may prefer more liquid and less volatile stocks. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM SANTA CLARA, Calif., March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVL), a leader in data infrastructure semiconductor solutions, today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized a $3 billion addition to the balance of its existing stock repurchase program, increasing the total current repurchase authority to approximately $3.3 billion. This $3 billion increase is the largest repurchase authorization in our history. Marvell's existing share repurchase program had approximately $299 million of repurchase authority remaining as of the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024. Under the program authorized by its Board of Directors, Marvell may repurchase stock in the open-market or through privately negotiated transactions. The extent to which Marvell repurchases its stock and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon market conditions and other corporate considerations, as determined by Marvell's management team.

Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement by Nikola Corporation about IMC's adoption of hydrogen fuel cell electric trucks represents a strategic move in the transportation sector, which is undergoing a significant shift towards sustainability. This transition is particularly relevant as it aligns with upcoming California regulations, setting a precedent for future industry standards. From a market perspective, the commitment by a major drayage company to transition its fleet could signal a broader trend and potentially drive demand for zero-emission vehicles.For investors, the deployment of these trucks could indicate Nikola's operational readiness and the market's acceptance of hydrogen technology. The successful delivery and operation of these trucks can serve as a proof of concept, potentially leading to increased confidence in Nikola's technology and future sales growth. However, investors should consider the scalability of hydrogen infrastructure and the total cost of ownership when evaluating the long-term viability of this technology. Environmental Policy Expert IMC's integration of Nikola's hydrogen fuel cell electric trucks is a direct response to environmental policy pressures, particularly in California. The state's aggressive stance on phasing out fossil-fuel vehicles by 2035 is driving companies to adopt zero-emission technologies. This policy-driven demand for clean vehicles is not only beneficial for the environment but also creates new market opportunities for companies like Nikola.While the move is commendable for its environmental impact, the effectiveness of these policies in achieving their intended goals will depend on the availability of supporting infrastructure and the life-cycle emissions of the hydrogen fuel. Stakeholders should assess the environmental implications of hydrogen production methods and the availability of renewable energy sources to ensure that the shift to zero-emission vehicles leads to genuine sustainability gains. Financial Analyst Nikola's deal with IMC could impact its financial performance positively. The sale of 50 trucks, with an initial delivery of 10 units, represents a significant revenue stream. Furthermore, the utilization of incentive programs such as CARB's HVIP and the Port of Los Angeles' Clean Truck Fund Rate could improve the cost-effectiveness of these vehicles for IMC, potentially increasing the attractiveness of Nikola's offerings to other companies.Investors should monitor the execution of this deal and subsequent fleet performance closely, as this could influence Nikola's stock price and future contracts. The ability of Nikola to deliver the remaining trucks on schedule and the operational success of these vehicles in IMC's fleet will be critical in evaluating the company's potential for growth and profitability in the zero-emission vehicle market. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM IMC showcases zero-emission technology and celebrates their west coast sustainability initiative at state-of-the-art Compton facility PHOENIX, March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Nikola Corporation (Nasdaq: NKLA), a global leader in zero-emissions transportation and energy supply and infrastructure solutions, via the HYLA brand, proudly marked a significant milestone as IMC, the largest marine drayage company in the U.S., unveiled the inaugural livery that will adorn its fleet of 50 Nikola hydrogen fuel cell electric trucks. This milestone follows a strategic deal that has been in progress since early 2023 and was formally commemorated during the grand opening of IMC's state-of-the-art sustainable Compton facility. ""Nikola is proud to be at the forefront of sustainable transportation alongside IMC,"" said Nikola President and CEO Steve Girsky. ""Their vision to transition their fleet to zero-emissions is a testament to their leadership in the drayage sector and sets a high standard for the industry. We're honored to be aligned with them as we all work to decarbonize the industry."" In a forward-thinking move, IMC initiated the purchase of 50 Nikola hydrogen fuel cell electric trucks through Tom's Truck Centers, a valued member of the Nikola sales and service dealer network. This strategic deal has already brought IMC the initial batch of 10 trucks in Q423, with an additional 10 scheduled for this month. The remaining 30 are expected to be delivered by the end of 2024, solidifying IMC's commitment to a more sustainable future. ""Our order for 50 Nikola hydrogen fuel cell electric trucks signifies our commitment to innovation and sustainability in drayage operations,"" said IMC CEO Joel Henry. ""We're confident that these technology-advanced trucks will not only meet but exceed our expectations for enhanced efficiency and operational excellence."" As a key player in hauling containers from ports to warehouses, IMC is responding to the growing demand for sustainable transportation. The deployment of these hydrogen-powered trucks will be utilized in IMC's operations primarily in Calif., as well as in Ariz. and Nev. In compliance with pending California regulations mandating that all new drayage trucks registered must be zero-emission vehicles in an effort to phase out fossil-fuel trucks from ports by 2035, Nikola's hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles offer an immediate and viable solution. Assisted by Nikola's Southern California dealer, Tom's Truck Centers, IMC secured significant incentives through CARB's Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project (""HVIP"") program and Port of Los Angeles' Clean Truck Fund Rate.

(NYSE: OPFI) reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023, with total revenue increasing by 10.7% to $132.9 million in Q4 and reaching $508.9 million for the year.

The company achieved its ninth consecutive year of net income and saw positive improvements in its net charge-off rate. OppFi's CEO highlighted the focus on profitable growth and efficient scaling of operating expenses for 2024, aiming to create additional shareholder value. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from OppFi Inc. for the full-year and fourth quarter of 2023 show significant growth in net income and total revenue, which are key indicators of a company's profitability and financial health. The net income growth of 1082.0% year-over-year and a total revenue increase of 12.4% are particularly noteworthy. These figures, coupled with the improved net charge-off rates, suggest effective credit risk management and operational efficiency.From a valuation perspective, the substantial increase in adjusted EBITDA by 112.9% and adjusted EPS growth signals strong operational performance and earnings quality, which could influence investor sentiment and stock valuation positively. However, the negative basic EPS reported for the full year may raise concerns about the dilutive effects of potential future equity offerings or conversions of Class V common stock. Market Research Analyst OppFi's focus on extending credit access through a tech-enabled platform is reflective of the broader fintech industry trend towards digitalization and financial inclusion. The company's ability to maintain a 100% origination rate by bank partners indicates a strong partnership model and potentially a competitive moat. The increased auto-approval rate, from 69% to 73% year-over-year, suggests improvements in OppFi's underwriting algorithms and operational efficiency, which could enhance customer experience and market share in the long term.Looking forward, OppFi's guidance for 2024, with projected total revenue of $510 million to $530 million and adjusted net income of $46 million to $49 million, provides a positive outlook that may be factored into market expectations. The guidance reflects management's confidence in sustained growth and profitability, which is crucial for investor relations and stock performance. Risk Management Expert The improvement in the net charge-off rate, from 59% to 46% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, is indicative of improved credit risk management. A lower net charge-off rate is significant as it reflects a decrease in the proportion of debt that the company believes it will not collect, which can be attributed to better credit policies or a healthier customer base. The reported annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average receivables also decreased from 70% to 59%, further confirming the trend of improved asset quality.The ability to manage credit risk effectively is particularly important for financial companies like OppFi, as it impacts loan performance, default rates and ultimately, the company's financial stability and reputation. The reported improvements in these metrics may contribute to investor confidence and could impact the company's cost of capital favorably in the future. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM Record total revenue and ending receivables for full-year 2023 Ninth consecutive year of net income Net income of $39.5 million for full-year 2023 Adjusted net income of $43.3 million for full-year 2023 Net charge off rate as a percentage of total revenue improved by 8.1 percentage points to 43.5% for full-year 2023 Total revenue increased 10.7% year over year to $132.9 million for fourth quarter of 2023 Net income of $1.9 million for fourth quarter of 2023 Adjusted net income of $8.9 million for fourth quarter of 2023 Annualized net charge off rate as a percentage of total revenue improved by 12.9 percentage points year over year to 46.4% for fourth quarter of 2023 CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- OppFi Inc.

Words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “possible,” “continue,” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, OppFi’s expectations with respect to its first quarter and full year 2024 guidance, the future performance of OppFi’s platform, and expectations for OppFi’s growth and future financial performance. These forward-looking statements are based on OppFi’s current expectations and assumptions about future events and are based on currently available information as to the outcome and timing of future events. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results. Most of these factors are outside OppFi’s control and are difficult to predict. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: the impact of general economic conditions, including economic slowdowns, inflation, interest rate changes, recessions, and tightening of credit markets on OppFi’s business; the impact of challenging macroeconomic and marketplace conditions, including lingering effects of COVID-19 on OppFi’s business; the impact of stimulus or other government programs; whether OppFi will be successful in obtaining declaratory relief against the Commissioner of the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation for the State of California; whether OppFi will be subject to AB 539; whether OppFi’s bank partners will continue to lend in California and whether OppFi’s financing sources will continue to finance the purchase of participation rights in loans originated by OppFi’s bank partners in California; the impact that events involving financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, such as actual concerns or events involving liquidity, defaults, or non-performance, may have on OppFi’s business; risks related to the material weakness in OppFi’s internal controls over financial reporting; the ability of OppFi to grow and manage growth profitably and retain its key employees; risks related to new products; risks related to evaluating and potentially consummating acquisitions; concentration risk; risks related to OppFi’s ability to comply with various covenants in its corporate and warehouse credit facilities; costs related to the business combination; changes in applicable laws or regulations; the possibility that OppFi may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; risks related to management transitions; risks related to the restatement of OppFi’s financial statements and any accounting deficiencies or weaknesses related thereto; and other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in OppFi’s filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, in particular, contained in the section or sections captioned “Risk Factors.” OppFi cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive, and readers should not place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. OppFi does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that are unaudited and do not conform to GAAP, such as Adjusted EBT, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS. Adjusted EBT is defined as Net Income, plus (1) income tax expense (benefit); (2) debt issuance cost amortization; (3) other addbacks and one-time expenses, net; and (4) sublease income. Adjusted Net Income is defined as Adjusted EBT as defined above, adjusted for taxes assuming a tax rate of 21.12% for the three months ended December 31, 2023, a tax rate of 24.68% for the three months ended December 31, 2022, a tax rate of 23.56% for the full year ended December 31, 2023, and a tax rate of 24.17% for the full year ended December 31, 2022, reflecting the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% and a blended statutory rate for state income taxes, in order to allow for a comparison with other publicly traded companies. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted Net Income as defined above, excluding (1) pro forma and business (non-income) taxes; (2) depreciation and amortization; and (3) interest expense. Adjusted EPS is defined as Adjusted Net Income as defined above, divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding, which represent shares of both classes of common stock outstanding, excluding 25,500,000 shares related to earnout obligations and including the impact of unvested restricted stock units, unvested performance stock units, and the employee stock purchase plan. Adjusted EPS is useful to investors and others because, due to OppFi’s Up-C structure, Basic EPS calculated on a GAAP basis excludes a large percentage of OppFi’s outstanding shares of common stock, which are Class V Voting Stock, and Diluted EPS calculated on a GAAP basis excludes dilutive securities, including Class V Voting Stock, in any period in which OppFi reports a loss as dilutive securities are considered to be antidilutive. These non-GAAP financial measures have not been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. OppFi believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends. These non-GAAP measures with comparable names should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for reconciliations for OppFi's non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of projected full year 2024 Adjusted Net Income and projected first quarter and full year 2024 Adjusted EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is not included in this press release because, without unreasonable efforts, the Company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the amount or timing of non-GAAP adjustments that are used to calculate these measures.

Outlook for 2024 includes expectations of improved bottom line despite challenges. Leadership changes announced with CFO resigning and new Acting CFO appointed. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported financial performance of Funko, Inc. highlights several key aspects that are of particular interest from a market research standpoint. The company's Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) growth is noteworthy, as it signifies a strategic shift towards more control over sales channels, which is a trend across retail sectors. The increase in DTC sales can potentially lead to higher margins and a more direct relationship with consumers. However, the overall decline in net sales year-over-year, from $1.3 billion to $1.1 billion, raises questions about broader market demand and the effectiveness of Funko's product diversification strategies.Furthermore, the gross margin improvement from 28.3% to 37.6% indicates a successful cost management strategy, likely through the reduction of excess inventory and operational efficiencies. This is a positive signal for investors, as it suggests the company's restructuring efforts are bearing fruit. Nonetheless, the significant net loss reported, though reduced from the previous year, points to ongoing challenges in achieving profitability. It is crucial to monitor how Funko's operational improvements translate into sustained financial performance in the face of a softer content schedule and shipping cost uncertainties. Financial Analyst From a financial analysis perspective, Funko's balance sheet provides a mixed picture. The reduction in inventory levels from $246 million to $119 million is a strong indicator of improved liquidity and inventory management. This is particularly important for a company like Funko, which deals with trend-based products that can quickly become obsolete. The paydown of debt by $26 million in the fourth quarter is another positive development, as it suggests the company is prioritizing its capital structure and working towards a healthier debt-to-equity ratio.However, the increase in total debt from $245.8 million to $273.6 million year-over-year is a concern, as it may reflect underlying financial stress. The provided financial guidance for 2024, with an expected net sales range of $1.047 billion to $1.103 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $65 million to $85 million, will be key metrics to watch. These figures will be crucial in assessing whether Funko can leverage its cost reduction and operational improvements into a more stable growth trajectory. Legal Expert It is important to note that Funko's financial results include several non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA. While these measures can provide a more tailored view of the company's operational performance by excluding certain one-time charges and non-operational expenses, they are not standardized across the industry. Investors should be cautious and consider the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. This will ensure a complete understanding of the company's financial health and comparability with other companies in the sector.The resignation of the CFO and COO, Steve Nave, is a significant event that could influence investor sentiment. Leadership transitions can lead to changes in corporate strategy and financial management, which in turn can impact stock performance. The appointment of Yves LePendeven as Acting CFO will be closely watched by stakeholders for indications of continuity or change in financial strategy. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM --Q4 Net Sales, Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA at Upper End of Expectations, Driven by Strong DTC Growth and Continued Operational Improvement-- EVERETT, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Funko, Inc.

Gross margin of 38 percent was the highest of any quarter in 2023. “Turning to our balance sheet, we substantially lowered our inventory levels to $119 million at December 31, 2023 from $246 million at the end of last year and $162 million at September 30, 2023. We also paid down our debt by $26 million in the fourth quarter and used the proceeds from a transaction related to our Games business to further reduce our debt in the first quarter of 2024. “Looking ahead, we face a softer content schedule following the recent Hollywood strikes and uncertainty around shipping costs caused by the Red Sea situation. Despite these headwinds, we expect our bottom line to significantly improve in 2024 compared with 2023. Our belief is based on the actions we are taking to, among other things, further expand our DTC business and increase sales of Pop! Yourself and limited-edition products – areas we control and can grow profitably.” Leadership Update The company also announced today that Steve Nave, Funko’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Chief Operating Officer, is resigning effective March 15, 2024. Yves LePendeven, the company’s Deputy CFO, will serve as Acting CFO as of the same date. “Steve joined us a year ago to help with our cost reduction and operational improvement plan,” said Lunsford. “We have made significant progress against that plan and thank Steve for his contributions. We wish Steve success in his future endeavors. “I have worked with Yves for several years now, as both a board member and as the interim CEO. I have complete faith in Yves to lead our Finance and Accounting functions. We believe we now have in place a strong, lean, aligned senior leadership team to support the arrival of a new CEO and the growth of Funko.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Net Sales by Category and Geography The tables below show the breakdown of net sales on a brand category and geographical basis (in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Period Over Period Change 2023 2022 Dollar Percentage Net sales by product brand: Core Collectibles $ 212,776 $ 243,340 $ (30,564 ) (12.6 )% Loungefly Branded Products 54,908 73,346 (18,438 ) (25.1 )% Other 23,552 16,354 7,198 44.0 % Total net sales $ 291,236 $ 333,040 $ (41,804 ) (12.6 )% Three Months Ended December 31, Period Over Period Change 2023 2022 Dollar Percentage Net sales by geography: United States $ 197,368 $ 240,647 $ (43,279 ) (18.0 )% Europe 78,138 61,869 16,269 26.3 % Other International 15,730 30,524 (14,794 ) (48.5 )% Total net sales $ 291,236 $ 333,040 $ (41,804 ) (12.6 )% Balance Sheet Highlights - At December 31, 2023 vs December 31, 2022 Total cash and cash equivalents were $36.5 million at December 31, 2023 versus $19.2 million at December 31, 2022 Inventories were $119.5 million at December 31, 2023 versus $246.4 million at December 31, 2022 Total debt was $273.6 million at December 31, 2023 versus $245.8 million at December 31, 2022.

The replay of the webcast will be available for one year. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This release contains references to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income (loss), including per share amounts, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin, which are financial measures that are not prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). Management uses these measures internally for evaluating its operating performance, for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and financials projections, and to assess incentive compensation for our employees, and to evaluate our capacity to expand our business. In addition, our senior secured credit facilities use adjusted EBITDA to measure our compliance with covenants such as senior leverage ratio. The company's management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information regarding operational performance, because it enhances an investor's overall understanding of the financial results for the company's core business. Additionally, it provides a basis for the comparison of the financial results for the company's core business between current, past and future periods as they remove the impact of items not directly resulting from our core operations. The company also believes that including Adjusted EBITDA and the other non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release is appropriate to provide additional information to investors and help to compare against other companies in our industry. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should be considered only as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or as a superior measure to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of adjusted net income (loss), including per share amounts, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by our competitors, because not all companies and analysts calculate these measures in the same manner. Detailed reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the financial tables following this release.

Financial Analyst The reported financial results by Granite Ridge Resources, Inc. for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 indicate a robust fiscal performance, with a net income of $17.5 million for the quarter and $81.1 million for the year. The company's production growth of 18% in the fourth quarter and 23% for the full year, alongside a year-over-year increase in proved reserves of 6%, demonstrates a successful implementation of their growth strategy. The declaration of a dividend suggests confidence in their financial health and commitment to providing shareholder returns.The sale of certain Permian Basin assets to Vital Energy, Inc. reflects a strategic shift in asset allocation and portfolio optimization. This divestiture, along with the reported liquidity of $140.1 million, provides Granite Ridge with capital flexibility to pursue further growth opportunities or to enhance shareholder value. The company's initial guidance for 2024, anticipating a 7% production increase, suggests a positive outlook, although it is important for investors to consider the potential volatility in commodity prices and their impact on future earnings. Market Research Analyst Granite Ridge's operational strategy, highlighted by the completion of 80 gross wells and the closing of ten unique transactions, indicates a proactive approach to asset management and growth. The strategic acquisitions in the Haynesville region and transactions in the Delaware Basin reflect targeted investments in areas with potential for high returns. The market should note the company's balanced approach to buying and selling assets, which can optimize their portfolio for better financial performance.Additionally, the company's commodity derivatives strategy is crucial for mitigating risks associated with commodity price fluctuations. This financial maneuvering is a critical aspect of the company's risk management strategy and can provide a more predictable cash flow, which is often favorable in the eyes of investors. Energy Sector Analyst Granite Ridge's reported increase in production and reserves is significant within the energy sector, particularly given the current global energy landscape. The company's focus on both oil (47%) and natural gas (53%) reserves aligns with the broader industry trend of diversifying energy portfolios. The shift in reserves composition with a slight majority towards natural gas may reflect strategic positioning in anticipation of the energy transition and potential increases in natural gas demand.Moreover, the company's capital deployment of $78.4 million towards development and property acquisition costs underscores a commitment to growth through investment in productive assets. This level of expenditure, coupled with the reported increase in production, suggests efficient capital allocation, a crucial metric for assessing the long-term sustainability of an energy company's growth trajectory. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Granite Ridge Resources, Inc. (NYSE: GRNT) (“Granite Ridge” or the “Company”) today reported financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 and provided initial guidance for 2024. Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights Grew production 18% to 26,034 barrels of oil equivalent (“Boe”) per day (47% oil) versus the prior year quarter Reported net income of $17.5 million, or $0.13 per share and Adjusted Net Income (non-GAAP) of $26.4 million, or $0.20 per share Generated $81.8 million of Adjusted EBITDAX (non-GAAP) Deployed $78.4 million of capital Placed 80 gross (4.60 net) wells online Declared dividend of $0.11 per share of common stock of the Company Completed the sale of certain Permian Basin assets to Vital Energy, Inc. (NYSE: VTLE) Ended 2023 with $140.1 million of liquidity See “Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for descriptions of the above non-GAAP measures as well as a reconciliation of these measures to the associated GAAP (as defined herein) measures. Luke Brandenberg, President and CEO of Granite Ridge, commented, “We were pleased to end fourth quarter and full year 2023 with an average daily production increase of 18% and 23%, respectively. We also posted a year-over-year increase in proved reserves of 6%. This was a direct result of our successful multi-pronged strategy as we thoughtfully grow the business, and I want to thank our full team for their hard work and dedication as we continue to execute on additional opportunities to further enhance our asset base. We continued these efforts in the fourth quarter of 2023 with the closing of ten unique transactions, including two Haynesville acquisitions alongside an existing operating partner for a combined $24 million and two transactions with a Strategic Partner in the Delaware Basin including aggregate inventory of 1.9 net locations, acquisition cost of $3 million, and estimated future development cost of $18 million. While we are typically a buyer of assets, we are always looking for opportunities to redeploy capital at attractive valuations. As such, sometimes it makes sense to divest. This occurred in the fourth quarter with our sale of certain Permian Basin assets to Vital Energy for consideration that included common shares and preferred securities.” Mr. Brandenberg concluded, “Looking forward, we continue to see a lot of runway in front of us. This view supports our 2024 guidance of an increase of approximately 7% in production at the midpoint from 2023 levels, after adjusting for the divestiture of the assets to Vital. We look forward to keeping everyone apprised of our progress as we continue to execute our proven growth strategy and support our shareholders through our ongoing quarterly cash dividend payment program.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Summary Oil production for the quarter totaled 12,280 barrels (“Bbls”) per day, a 8% increase from the prior year quarter. Natural gas production for the quarter totaled 82,525 thousand cubic feet of natural gas (“Mcf”) per day, a 29% increase from the prior year quarter. The Company’s total production for the quarter grew 18% from the prior year quarter to 26,034 Boe per day. Total production for the quarter after adjusting for divested assets was approximately 24,500 Boe per day. The Company’s average realized price for oil and natural gas, excluding the effect of commodity derivatives, was $76.43 per Bbl and $2.69 per Mcf, respectively. Net income for the quarter was $17.5 million, or $0.13 per diluted share of common stock. Excluding non-cash and special items, Adjusted Net Income (non-GAAP) was $26.4 million for the quarter, or $0.20 per diluted share of common stock. Adjusted EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for the quarter totaled $81.8 million, compared to $83.2 million for the prior year quarter. Cash flow from operating activities was $90.2 million, including $7.5 million in working capital changes. Operating Cash Flow (“OCF”) Before Working Capital Changes (non-GAAP) was $82.6 million. Costs incurred for development activities and property acquisition costs totaled $50.8 million and $27.5 million, respectively. On December 21, 2023, Granite Ridge completed the sale of certain of its Permian Basin assets to Vital Energy, Inc. (NYSE: VTLE) (“Vital Energy”) for consideration of 561,752 shares of Vital Energy’s common stock and 541,155 shares of Vital Energy’s 2.0% cumulative mandatorily convertible preferred securities. The assets sold consisted of approximately 1,658 net acres and 45 gross (9.90 net) producing wells in the Permian Basin and contributed approximately 1,700 Boe per day of production to 2023 results. Full Year 2023 Summary Total production increased 23% to 24,311 Boe per day (47% oil), including a 14% increase in oil production to 11,404 Bbls per day and a 32% increase in natural gas production to 77,442 Mcf per day. Total production after adjusting for divested assets was approximately 22,600 Boe per day.

Granite Ridge Resources, Inc. Derivatives Information The table below provides data associated with the Company’s derivatives at March 7, 2024, for the periods indicated: 2024 2025 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Total Total Collar (oil) Volume (Bbl) 461,524 401,874 361,552 311,496 1,536,446 439,852 Weighted-average floor price ($/Bbl) $ 64.22 $ 64.27 $ 64.32 $ 64.13 $ 64.24 $ 61.48 Weighted-average ceiling price ($/Bbl) $ 84.99 $ 85.11 $ 85.24 $ 84.97 $ 85.07 $ 80.65 Swaps (oil) Volume (Bbl) 62,000 48,000 39,000 32,000 181,000 — Weighted-average price ($/Bbl) $ 80.00 $ 80.00 $ 80.00 $ 80.00 $ 80.00 $ — Collar (natural gas) Volume (Mcf) 3,856,000 — — 1,615,000 5,471,000 2,156,000 Weighted-average floor price ($/Mcf) $ 2.93 $ — $ — $ 3.57 $ 3.12 $ 3.57 Weighted-average ceiling price ($/Mcf) $ 4.39 $ — $ — $ 5.37 $ 4.68 $ 5.37 Swaps (natural gas) Volume (Mcf) — 3,236,000 2,823,000 844,000 6,903,000 1,612,050 Weighted-average price ($/Mcf) $ — $ 3.22 $ 3.22 $ 3.22 $ 3.22 $ 3.20 Granite Ridge Resources, Inc. Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. However, the Company believes certain non-GAAP performance measures may provide financial statement users with additional meaningful comparisons between current results, the results of its peers and the results of prior periods. In addition, the Company believes these measures are used by analysts and others in the valuation, rating and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry. See the reconciliations throughout this release of GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures for the periods indicated. Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDAX Adjusted EBITDAX is presented herein and reconciled from the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDAX as net income before depletion and accretion expense, (gain) loss on derivatives – commodity derivatives, net cash receipts from (payments on) commodity derivatives, interest expense, (gain) loss on derivatives – common stock warrants, non-cash stock-based compensation, warrant exchange transaction, income tax expense, impairment of long-lived assets, gain on equity investments and other. Adjusted EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flows as determined by GAAP. The Company’s Adjusted EBITDAX measure provides additional information that may be used to better understand the Company’s operations. Adjusted EBITDAX is one of several metrics that the Company uses as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of its business and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as an indicator of operating performance. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable and deletable assets. Adjusted EBITDAX, as used by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many metrics used by the Company’s management team and by other users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. For example, Adjusted EBITDAX can be used to assess the Company’s operating performance and return on capital in comparison to other independent exploration and production companies without regard to financial or capital structure, and to assess the financial performance of the Company’s assets and the Company without regard to capital structure or historical cost basis. The following table provides a reconciliation of the GAAP measure of net income to Adjusted EBITDAX for the periods indicated: Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net income $ 17,539 $ 56,625 $ 81,099 $ 262,344 Interest expense 2,409 285 5,315 1,989 Income tax expense 4,415 12,850 24,483 12,850 Other (1,384 ) — 176 — Depletion and accretion expense 47,574 21,656 160,662 105,752 Non-cash stock-based compensation 349 — 2,162 — Impairments of long-lived assets 26,496 — 26,496 — Warrant exchange transaction costs — — 2,456 — (Gain) loss on derivatives - commodity derivatives (19,129 ) (5,463 ) (25,544 ) 25,324 Gain on equity investments (508 ) — (508 ) — Net cash receipts from (payments on) commodity derivatives 4,065 (2,431 ) 22,895 (42,437 ) (Gain) loss on derivatives - common stock warrants — (362 ) 5,742 (362 ) Adjusted EBITDAX $ 81,826 $ 83,160 $ 305,434 $ 365,460 Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Operating Cash Flow Before Working Capital Changes and to Free Cash Flow The Company provides OCF Before Working Capital Changes, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company defines OCF Before Working Capital Changes as net cash provided by operating activities as determined under GAAP excluding changes in operating assets and liabilities such as: changes in cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities, revenue receivable, other receivable, accrued expenses, prepaid and other expenses and other payables. The Company believes OCF Before Working Capital Changes is an accepted measure of an oil and natural gas company’s ability to generate cash used to fund development and acquisition activities and service debt or pay dividends. Additionally, the Company provides Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company defines Free Cash Flow as OCF Before Working Capital Changes minus development costs. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as it provides measures to compare cash from operating activities and exploration and development costs across periods on a consistent basis. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net cash provided by operating activities as indicators of operating performance. The following tables provide a reconciliation from the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities to OCF Before Working Capital Changes and to Free Cash Flow: Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 90,175 $ 95,032 $ 302,867 $ 346,389 Changes in cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities: Revenue receivable (9,699 ) (2,528 ) 846 24,989 Other receivable (103 ) — (103 ) — Accrued expenses (1,923 ) (4,906 ) (4,550 ) (9,838 ) Prepaid and other expenses 1,369 (4,608 ) (485 ) 2,095 Other payable 2,815 (18 ) (350 ) (5 ) Total working capital changes (7,541 ) (12,060 ) (4,642 ) 17,241 Operating Cash Flow Before Working Capital Changes 82,634 82,972 298,225 363,630 Development costs 50,844 91,741 283,915 256,664 Free Cash Flow $ 31,790 $ (8,769 ) $ 14,310 $ 106,966 Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share The Company provides Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share represent earnings and diluted earnings per share determined under GAAP without regard to certain non-cash and nonrecurring items. The Company defines Adjusted Net Income as net income as determined under GAAP excluding impairments of long-lived assets, gain on disposal of oil and natural gas properties, (gain) loss on derivatives - commodity derivatives, net cash receipts from (payments on) commodity derivatives, gain (loss) on derivatives - common stock warrants, (gain) loss on equity investments, deferred finance cost amortization acceleration, warrant exchange transaction costs, tax impact on above adjustments and changes in deferred taxes and other estimates. The Company defines Adjusted Earnings Per Share as Adjusted Net Income divided by weighted average number of diluted shares of common stock outstanding. The Company believes these measures provide useful information to analysts and investors for analysis of its operating results on a recurring, comparable basis from period to period. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for earnings or diluted earnings per share as determined in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Myomo's operating loss for Q4 2023 was $2.4 million. Financial Analyst The reported increase in total revenue to $4.8 million for Q4, representing an 18% year-over-year growth, is a positive indicator of Myomo's scaling capabilities and market acceptance. This is further supported by the 87% increase in MyoPro orders and insurance authorizations, which suggests a growing demand for the company's wearable medical robotics. The reported record backlog of 230 patients could be seen as a potential revenue stream, securing future financial stability. However, it is important to assess the company's ability to convert this backlog into recognized revenue efficiently.The gross margin improvement, though marginal, reflects effective cost management and pricing strategies. However, investors should note the operating loss and net loss figures, which indicate that the company is yet to achieve profitability. The slight increase in operating expenses, primarily due to development spending and incentive compensation, suggests an investment in future growth, but this needs to be monitored to ensure it translates into increased revenues and market share. The cash position, bolstered by a recent equity offering, provides a cushion for operational activities and expansion plans but warrants close scrutiny of cash burn rates in relation to revenue growth trajectories. Medical Device Market Analyst Myomo's performance in the medical device sector, particularly within the wearable robotics space for neurological disorders, appears to be gaining traction. The inclusion of Medicare Part B patients in the backlog represents a significant development, as it opens up a broader market segment and provides a more stable reimbursement landscape. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' designation of the MyoPro as a brace and the establishment of HCPCS codes for reimbursement could significantly enhance the product's accessibility to patients. This development is likely to contribute positively to the company's market penetration strategy.However, the company's future success will depend on its ability to scale manufacturing and clinical operations to meet the demand indicated by the growing backlog. The planned hiring of additional staff to increase capacity is a step in the right direction, but operational efficiency and supply chain management will be critical to avoid potential disruptions that could impact revenue projections. The projected revenue for 2024 and the goal of reaching operating cash flow breakeven by Q4 2024 are ambitious targets that will require close monitoring of the company's execution on its operational plans. Healthcare Policy Expert The recent policy updates from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have significant implications for Myomo's business strategy. The official designation of the MyoPro as a brace and the associated reimbursement rates set by CMS are likely to influence the company's pricing strategy and market dynamics. It is crucial for stakeholders to understand the impact of such policy changes on the company's revenue model, especially given the reliance on Medicare Part B patients as a key customer segment.Moreover, the company's proactive engagement with CMS' regional billing contractors, known as DME MACs, demonstrates an understanding of the complexities involved in navigating the healthcare reimbursement landscape. The ability to secure rental and lump sum payments across all four Medicare billing regions indicates a competent reimbursement strategy, which is critical for the company's financial health. Stakeholders should, however, remain cognizant of the potential for regulatory changes that could affect reimbursement rates and eligibility criteria, which could impact the company's financial projections and market strategy. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM Q4 total revenue of $4.8 million, up 18% over the prior year Addition of Medicare Part B patients to backlog results in record 183 MyoPro orders and insurance authorizations received in Q4, up 87% over the prior year Record backlog of 230 patients as of December 31, 2023 Introduces 2024 first quarter and full year guidance Conference call begins at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time today BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Myomo, Inc.

Growth in total and product revenue was driven by a higher number of revenue units and a higher average selling price (“ASP”). Myomo recognized revenue on 107 MyoPro units in the fourth quarter of 2023, up 6% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Full year product revenue was $17.5 million, up 20% over 2022. Including license revenue, total revenue for 2023 was $19.2 million, up 24% compared with 2022. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 65.3%, compared with 65.0% for the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was driven primarily by a higher ASP, offset by some material and other cost increases. Full year 2023 gross margin was 68.5%, compared with 65.9% in 2022. The increase was due to higher license revenue from the Company's joint venture in China, which is recorded at 100% gross margin, and a slightly higher ASP. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $5.5 million, an increase of 14% compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was driven primarily by higher outside development spending to accelerate completion of certain projects and higher incentive compensation accruals, offset by lower advertising expenses. Advertising costs of $0.9 million decreased 17% from the fourth quarter of 2022. Cost per pipeline add was $2,246, a decrease of 16% from the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating expenses for 2023 were $21.4 million, an increase of 2% from 2022. Operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $2.4 million, compared with an operating loss of $2.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $2.5 million, or $0.07 per share, compared with a net loss of $2.2 million, or $0.29 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2022. Full year 2023 operating loss was $8.2 million, compared with an operating loss of $10.7 million for 2022. Full year 2023 net loss was $8.1 million, or $0.28 per share, compared with a net loss of $10.7 million, or $1.52 per share, for 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $(2.1) million, compared with $(1.9) million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Full year 2023 Adjusted EBITDA was $(7.0) million, compared with $(9.3) million for 2022. A reconciliation of GAAP net loss to this non-GAAP financial measure appears below. Operations Update The pipeline was 1,042 patients as of December 31, 2023, compared with 883 patients as of December 31, 2022, representing an increase of 18%. There were 381 patients added to the pipeline during the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 17% compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. The year end 2023 pipeline included more than 150 Medicare Part B patients. Backlog was a record 230 units as of December 31, 2023, up 40% compared with December 31, 2022. Backlog included 44 Medicare Part B patients for whom we are receiving rental payments and have not been paid in full, patients who have received a MyoPro with claims filed and patients who have been qualified for delivery based on receipt of appropriate medical documentation. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Update On January 1, 2024, the MyoPro was officially designated as a brace by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (""CMS"") and became eligible for lump sum reimbursement. On February 29, 2024, final fees were published by CMS for its Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (""HCSPS"") codes L8701 and L8702 of $33,480.90 and $65,871.74, respectively, effective April 1, 2024. In the meantime, payment amounts for Medicare Part B beneficiaries continue to be determined by CMS' regional billing contractors, known as DME MAC's. To date, the Company has filed claims with DME MAC's for 40 MyoPros provided to Medicare Part B patients. The claims were submitted either for reimbursement as a rental, or if submitted after January 1, 2024, as a lump sum payment. Of these, the Company has received rental and lump sum payments for 21 patients covering all four Medicare billing regions. All unpaid claims continue to be in process with the DME MAC's. Cash Position Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023 were $8.9 million, Cash used in operating activities was $2.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2022. Full year 2023 cash used in operations was $(6.2) million, a decrease of 40% compared with 2022. In January 2024, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $5.4 million from a registered direct equity offering. Pro forma for this offering, the Company began 2024 with approximately $14.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Business Outlook ""Revenue for the first quarter 2024 is expected to be in the range of $4.1 million to $4.3 million, with growth expected to accelerate through the remainder of the year. Revenues from Medicare Part B patients are expected to be more significant beginning in the second quarter,"" added Mr. Gudonis. ""With the proceeds from our recent equity offering, we are hiring staff to increase our clinical, reimbursement and manufacturing capacity in order to serve Medicare Part B patients. Our target is to bring 50 to 60 new employees on board by the end of the second quarter. Assuming we can increase capacity as planned, with no supply chain disruptions, we believe we have the opportunity to generate $28 million to $30 million in revenue in 2024, with second half revenues much higher than the first half. Assuming this rate of revenue growth, we believe reaching operating cash flow breakeven on a quarterly basis by the fourth quarter of 2024 is achievable.""

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the Company’s future business expectations, including expectations for first quarter and full year 2024 revenue, expectations regarding materiality of revenues from Medicare Part B patients and expectations for achieving operating cash flow breakeven on a quarterly basis, which are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors. These factors include, among other things: our ability to obtain sufficient reimbursement from third-party payers for our products; our ability to navigate factors both within and outside our control to grow revenues sufficiently to achieve operating cash flow breakeven on a quarterly basis; our revenue concentration with a particular insurance payer as a result of focusing our efforts on patients with insurers who have previously reimbursed for the MyoPro; our ability to continue normal operations and patient interactions without supply chain disruption in order to deliver and fit our custom-fabricated devices; our marketing and commercialization efforts; our dependence upon external sources for the financing of our operations, to the extent that we do not achieve or maintain cash flow breakeven; our ability to obtain and maintain our strategic collaborations and to realize the intended results of such collaborations; our ability to effectively execute our business plan and scale up our operations; our expectations as to our product development programs, including improving our existing products and developing new products; our ability to maintain and grow our reputation and to achieve and maintain the market acceptance of our products; our expectations as to our clinical research program and clinical results; our ability to maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property and to avoid violation of the intellectual property rights of others; our ability to gain and maintain regulatory approvals; our ability to compete and succeed in a highly competitive and evolving industry; and general market, economic, environmental and social factors that may affect the evaluation, fitting, delivery and sale of our products to patients. More information about these and other factors that potentially could affect our financial results is included in Myomo’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those contained in the risk factors section of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the Commission.

Positive Solid Q3 financial results for American Outdoor Brands, Inc. with net sales reaching $53.4 million, up 5.0% from the previous year. Traditional channel sales saw an 8.1% increase, while e-commerce channel sales grew by 1.6%. Gross margin was 42.7%, affected by tariff and freight costs from higher inventory purchases. GAAP net loss was $2.9 million, but non-GAAP net income reached $1.0 million. Adjusted EBITDAS stood at $2.4 million, representing 4.4% of net sales. The company is positive about future sales growth and product innovation. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported net sales growth of 5.0% by American Outdoor Brands indicates a positive trend in revenue, which is an essential metric for investors as it reflects the company's ability to increase its market share and overall demand for its products. The distinction between traditional channel sales and e-commerce channel sales is particularly noteworthy, with traditional channels experiencing a higher growth rate of 8.1% compared to e-commerce at 1.6%. This could suggest a robust recovery in brick-and-mortar retail for outdoor products, or a strategic push by the company in these channels that has outperformed digital growth.However, the decrease in gross margin by 440 basis points is a concern as it directly affects profitability. This contraction may be attributed to external cost pressures such as tariffs and freight costs, which have been amortized in the latter half of fiscal 2024. The impact on margins is an important aspect for investors to monitor, as it might indicate how external economic factors and cost management strategies are affecting the company's financial health. Financial Analyst The GAAP net loss remaining flat year-over-year, despite an increase in net sales, raises questions about the company's operational efficiency and cost control measures. The non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain expenses like stock compensation and technology implementation costs, show a decrease in net income and Adjusted EBITDAS. While these non-GAAP measures can provide a clearer picture of the company's operational performance, the decline suggests that there may be underlying issues affecting profitability that require further investigation.Investors should also consider the company's capital management strategies, as indicated by the strengthened balance sheet with $15.9 million in cash and no debt. The share repurchase program is typically seen as a signal of confidence by management in the long-term value of the company, but it also needs to be weighed against the potential need for cash reserves for investment in growth opportunities or to buffer against future economic uncertainties. Investment Strategist The company's strategic focus on product innovation and the successful introduction of new products, which accounted for over 22% of third-quarter net sales, can be seen as a positive indicator for future growth. This innovation pipeline, as part of the company's Dock & Unlock™ process, is designed to provide a competitive advantage and could lead to increased market share and entry into new markets. However, investors should also be aware of the risks associated with new product development, such as the potential for increased R&D costs and the uncertainty of consumer acceptance.The company's forecast that fiscal 2024 net sales could exceed the previous fiscal year's by up to 3.5% is a forward-looking statement that suggests management's confidence in continued growth. Nevertheless, it is important for investors to consider the broader economic environment and consumer spending trends in the outdoor sector, which can significantly impact the company's performance. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM • Net Sales $53.4 Million – Up 5.0%• Gross Margin 42.7%• Traditional Channel Sales $28.5 Million – Up 8.1%• E-Commerce Channel Sales $24.9 Million – Up 1.6% COLUMBIA, Mo., March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- American Outdoor Brands, Inc.

Traditional channel net sales increased 8.1%, while e-commerce net sales increased 1.6%. Compared with pre-COVID levels in fiscal 2020, quarterly net sales increased 23.3%.Quarterly gross margin was 42.7%, a decrease of 440 basis points, compared with quarterly gross margin of 47.1% for the comparable quarter last year. Gross margin in the quarter was impacted by the amortization in the second half of fiscal 2024 of tariff and freight costs stemming from higher inventory purchases that occurred in the first half of fiscal 2024.Quarterly GAAP net loss was $2.9 million, or ($0.23) per diluted share, compared with GAAP net loss of $2.9 million, or ($0.21) per diluted share, for the comparable quarter last year.Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $1.0 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared with non-GAAP net income of $1.7 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the comparable quarter last year. GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments for net income exclude acquired intangible amortization, stock compensation, technology implementation, and other costs.

For a detailed reconciliation, see the schedules that follow in this release.Brian Murphy, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""We delivered a solid quarter, and I am very pleased with our results, which included top line sales growth, disciplined capital management, and the unveiling of several strategically important product introductions that we believe expand our brands' runway for growth. I believe our results demonstrate our ability to remain focused on our long-term growth strategy, while successfully navigating the near-term environment. We delivered net sales growth of 5%, a result that came in ahead of our expectations and was supported by our diverse portfolio, evidenced by stronger sales across a number of brands within our Shooting Sports and Outdoor Lifestyle categories, which both delivered net sales growth. In addition, our e-Commerce and Traditional channels experienced net sales growth in the quarter."" ""Innovation, fueled by our Dock & Unlock™ process, is core to our long-term strategy, and new products launched within the past two years generated over 22% of our third quarter net sales. During the quarter, we launched a number of internally developed new products under our Caldwell, Grilla, and Hooyman brands. I believe these products are the tip of the iceberg, as we execute against a robust new product pipeline that extends well into the next five years, providing us with a long-term competitive advantage, and uniquely positioning our brands to expand market share, enter new product categories and markets, and broaden distribution."" Andrew Fulmer, Chief Financial Officer, said, ""In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we delivered net sales growth, we strengthened our balance sheet, we lowered product inventories both internally and within the channel, and we continued to return cash to stockholders through our share repurchase program. At the same time, we finalized the lease expansion at our Columbia, Missouri headquarters and distribution facility, providing us with capacity for future growth. We ended the quarter with $15.9 million in cash and no debt, after repurchasing approximately $1.8 million of our common stock."" ""We believe our brands remain well positioned to capitalize on positive, long-term consumer outdoor participation trends. As a result, we continue to believe that our net sales for fiscal 2024 could exceed fiscal 2023 net sales by as much as 3.5%,"" concluded Fulmer.

Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn this press release, certain non-GAAP financial measures, including ""non-GAAP net income"" and ""Adjusted EBITDAS"" are presented. A reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP financial measures are contained at the end of this press release. From time to time, the Company considers and uses these non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures of operating performance in order to provide the reader with an improved understanding of underlying performance trends. The Company believes it is useful for itself and the reader to review, as applicable, both (1) GAAP measures that include (i) amortization of acquired intangible assets, (ii) stock compensation, (iii) facility consolidation costs, (iv) technology implementation, (v) acquisition costs, (vi) stockholder cooperation agreement costs, (vii) income tax adjustments, (viii) interest expense, (ix) income tax expense, and (x) depreciation and amortization; and (2) the non-GAAP measures that exclude such information. The Company presents these non-GAAP measures because it considers them an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes the disclosure of such measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations. The Company's definition of these adjusted financial measures may differ from similarly named measures used by others. The Company believes these measures facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating potential differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company's GAAP measures. The principal limitations of these measures are that they do not reflect the Company's actual expenses and may thus have the effect of inflating its financial measures on a GAAP basis.

(MRVL) reported Q4 net revenue of $1.427 billion, growing by 1% year-on-year, with a GAAP net loss of $(392.7) million and non-GAAP net income of $401.6 million. For fiscal 2024, net revenue was $5.508 billion, with GAAP net loss of $(933.4) million and non-GAAP net income of $1.310 billion. The company expects continued sequential growth in data center revenue for Q1 fiscal 2025. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported net revenue of $1.427 billion for Q4, marking a modest year-on-year growth, indicates a stable demand for Marvell Technology's products despite a challenging economic climate. However, the GAAP net loss of $(392.7) million reflects significant expenses that impacted the company's profitability. Investors should note the substantial difference between GAAP and non-GAAP measures, with a non-GAAP net income of $401.6 million. This discrepancy is largely due to the exclusion of stock-based compensation, amortization and other non-recurring costs in the non-GAAP figures. From an investment perspective, the anticipated recovery in the second half of the fiscal year is a positive signal, suggesting that the management is confident about overcoming current market challenges. However, the forecasted soft demand in various end markets for the near term could be a concern for short-term investors. The company's focus on AI and data centers is strategically significant as these are high-growth areas that can potentially drive long-term revenue. Market Research Analyst Marvell's emphasis on AI-driven growth in data center revenue, which saw a significant increase both sequentially and year-over-year, positions the company at the forefront of a major technological shift. The 38% sequential and 54% year-over-year increase in data center end market revenue is particularly noteworthy, as it highlights the company's successful penetration into a rapidly expanding market segment. Furthermore, the expectation of initial shipments of cloud-optimized silicon programs for AI complements the company's existing electro-optics franchise and indicates an expansion of its product portfolio tailored to emerging tech trends. Investors should be aware of the potential for Marvell's products to become integral components in the infrastructure that supports the growing demand for AI applications, which could lead to sustained growth beyond the current fiscal year. Legal Expert It is important for stakeholders to understand the implications of the non-GAAP financial measures used by Marvell. These measures are intended to provide a clearer picture of the company's operational performance by excluding certain expenses deemed non-recurring or not directly related to core business operations. However, investors should approach non-GAAP measures with caution as they do not reflect all operational costs. The reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures and the rationale behind the adjustments, should be carefully reviewed to fully grasp the company's financial health. Additionally, the non-GAAP tax rate of 6.0% applied to the financial results is a significant adjustment that can impact the perceived profitability of the company. Investors should consider how such tax treatments and the potential for changes in tax laws or business structure could affect future financial reporting. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM Q4 Net Revenue: $1.427 billion, grew by 1% year-on-yearQ4 Gross Margin: 46.6% GAAP gross margin; 63.9% non-GAAP gross marginQ4 Diluted income (loss) per share: $(0.45) GAAP diluted loss per share; $0.46 non-GAAP diluted income per shareSANTA CLARA, Calif., March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Marvell Technology, Inc.

AI drove strong growth in our data center end market revenue which increased 38% sequentially and 54% year-over-year. As a critical enabler of accelerated infrastructure for AI, Marvell is well positioned to capitalize on this massive technology inflection, which continues to gain momentum,"" said Matt Murphy, Marvell's Chairman and CEO. ""In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect continued sequential growth in our data center revenue with initial shipments of our cloud optimized silicon programs for AI complementing our electro-optics franchise. While we are forecasting soft demand impacting consumer, carrier infrastructure, and enterprise networking in the near term, we expect revenue declines in these end markets to be behind us after the first quarter, and project a recovery in the second half of the fiscal year.""

Non-GAAP diluted EPS is calculated using diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.

Discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of the inventory fair value adjustment associated with acquisitions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition and divestiture-related costs, restructuring and other related charges (including, but not limited to, asset impairment charges, employee severance costs, and facilities related charges), resolution of legal matters, and certain expenses and benefits that are driven primarily by discrete events that management does not consider to be directly related to Marvell's core business. Although Marvell excludes the amortization of all acquired intangible assets from these non-GAAP financial measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase price accounting arising from acquisitions, and that such amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to Marvell's revenues earned during the periods presented and are expected to contribute to Marvell's future period revenues as well. Marvell uses a non-GAAP tax rate to compute the non-GAAP tax provision. This non-GAAP tax rate is based on Marvell's estimated annual GAAP income tax forecast, adjusted to account for items excluded from Marvell's non-GAAP income, as well as the effects of significant non-recurring and period specific tax items which vary in size and frequency, and excludes tax deductions and benefits from acquired tax loss and credit carryforwards and changes in valuation allowance on acquired deferred tax assets. Marvell's non-GAAP tax rate is determined on an annual basis and may be adjusted during the year to take into account events that may materially affect the non-GAAP tax rate such as tax law changes; acquisitions; significant changes in Marvell's geographic mix of revenue and expenses; or changes to Marvell's corporate structure. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, a non-GAAP tax rate of 6.0% has been applied to the non-GAAP financial results. Marvell believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to Marvell's financial condition and results of operations. While Marvell uses non-GAAP financial measures as a tool to enhance its understanding of certain aspects of its financial performance, Marvell does not consider these measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Consistent with this approach, Marvell believes that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the readers of its financial statements provides such readers with useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP financial measures, allows for greater transparency in the review of its financial and operational performance. Externally, management believes that investors may find Marvell's non-GAAP financial measures useful in their assessment of Marvell's operating performance and the valuation of Marvell. Internally, Marvell's non-GAAP financial measures are used in the following areas: Management's evaluation of Marvell's operating performance;Management's establishment of internal operating budgets;Management's performance comparisons with internal forecasts and targeted business models; andManagement's determination of the achievement and measurement of certain performance-based equity awards (adjustments may vary from award to award).Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of Marvell's business as determined in accordance with GAAP. As a result, you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Marvell's results as reported under GAAP. The exclusion of the above items from our GAAP financial metrics does not necessarily mean that these costs are unusual or infrequent.

(e) Other income tax effects and adjustments relate to the tax provision based on a non-GAAP income tax rate of 6.0%. In the three months and year ended February 3, 2024, we excluded $289 million and $158 million, respectively, of non-recurring income tax expense relating to guidance issued by the IRS on December 22, 2023 clarifying the requirement to capitalize certain U.S. R&D costs, which became effective for us retroactively to the year ended January 28, 2023. As a result of this IRS guidance, which is intended to be part of published Treasury Regulations, we have determined that such costs are currently deductible in computing our taxable income, and no longer have to be capitalized. This discrete change in treatment reduced the amount of R&D credits we utilized to offset our taxes, which reduced the deferred tax benefits that we previously recognized for utilization of such credits because they carried a full valuation allowance. As a result of this change, we have reinstated these R&D credit carryforwards with a full valuation allowance (consistent with past practice), and reduced our income taxes payable for the years ended January 28, 2023 and February 3, 2024. In the year ended January 28, 2023, $213.6 million of non-recurring income tax expense associated with the extension of a tax incentive in Singapore was excluded from our non-GAAP income tax expense. Additionally, we excluded $18.3 million of non-recurring income tax expense associated with the claw back of incentive benefits that resulted from our election to avail ourselves of a preferential temporary tax provision in Israel.

Net loss of $3.8 million compared to net income of $6.5 million in the previous year. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 23% to $19.3 million compared to $25.0 million in the previous year. Financial Analyst An increase in revenue juxtaposed with a decrease in gross profit and a swing from net income to net loss is a critical point of concern for stakeholders. The reported 4% revenue growth for Concrete Pumping Holdings indicates a modest expansion in their market reach or pricing power. However, the significant decline in gross profit by 9% suggests escalating costs or pricing pressures which could be eroding margins. The stark decline in income from operations and the reported net loss are indicative of operational challenges that may not be entirely attributable to market conditions, such as the severe weather mentioned.Moreover, the 23% decrease in Adjusted EBITDA and the contraction of the EBITDA margin from 26.8% to 19.7% is alarming as it points to deteriorating operational efficiency and profitability. It is essential to scrutinize the reasons behind these numbers, whether they are due to one-time events or signify systemic issues within the company. The slight increase in available liquidity provides a cushion, but the high net debt position of $373.3 million warrants caution as it may limit the company's financial flexibility and could become a significant burden if profitability continues to decline. Market Research Analyst The performance of Concrete Pumping Holdings reflects broader economic and environmental factors affecting the construction industry. The impact of severe weather on the U.S. segment, causing a 25% reduction in concrete pumping volume, highlights the sector's vulnerability to externalities. While the growth in the U.K. segment and Concrete Waste Management Services is promising, it is not sufficient to offset the losses incurred domestically.Market trends suggest that companies within this industry must develop robust contingency plans to mitigate the effects of unpredictable weather patterns, which are likely to become more common due to climate change. Diversification of services and geographical presence, as seen with CPH's U.K. operations, can serve as a buffer, but the overall resilience of the company's business model to such shocks needs to be evaluated. Economist The announcement of a $15 million increase to the share repurchase plan amidst declining financial performance could be interpreted as a signal of confidence from management in the company's intrinsic value or a strategic move to support the stock price. However, this action must be weighed against the backdrop of the company's financial health. A net loss and increased debt levels could imply that repurchasing shares might not be the most prudent use of capital at this time.From an economic perspective, the company's financial results and management's decisions should be analyzed in the context of the current macroeconomic environment, including interest rates, inflation and the cyclical nature of the construction industry. These factors can significantly influence the company's cost of capital, demand for services and ultimately, its stock performance. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM - Announces $15 Million Increase to Share Repurchase Plan -DENVER, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Concrete Pumping Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: BBCP) (the “Company” or “CPH”), a leading provider of concrete pumping and waste management services in the U.S. and U.K., reported financial results for the first quarter ended January 31, 2024. First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Summary vs. First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2023 (unless otherwise noted) ●Revenue increased 4% to $97.7 million compared to $93.6 million. ●Gross profit decreased 9% to $33.3 million compared to $36.5 million. ●Income from operations decreased to $1.5 million compared to $9.4 million. ●Net loss of $3.8 million compared to net income of $6.5 million. ●Net loss attributable to common shareholders of $4.3 million or $(0.08) per diluted share, compared to net income of $6.0 million or $0.11 per diluted share. ●Adjusted EBITDA1 decreased 23% to $19.3 million compared to $25.0 million, with Adjusted EBITDA margin1 of 19.7% compared to 26.8%. ●Amounts outstanding under debt agreements was $388.0 million with net debt1 of $373.3 million. Total available liquidity was $217.0 million as of January 31, 2024, compared to $216.7 million as of October 31, 2023. Management Commentary “In our first quarter, continued double-digit growth in our Concrete Waste Management Services and U.K. operations segments was roughly offset by severe winter weather that impacted our U.S. market,” said CPH CEO Bruce Young. “Specifically, heavy rainfall, snow and freezing temperatures in the month of January brought many of our customers' projects to a standstill. In fact, we estimate such weather events lowered the expected volume of our U.S. concrete pumping work by approximately 25% in January, or about $7.0 million. Work has recently returned to more normalized levels in February, and we are working closely with our customers to accommodate accelerated project schedules. “Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about our prospects for continued growth in 2024, led by increasing infrastructure activity and added light commercial and residential projects. Underlying this expectation of growth will be the benefits we receive from our diversified end markets, the high utilization of our fleet and the mission-critical service we offer.” ___________________1 Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, net debt and leverage ratio are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a discussion of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this release and a reconciliation to their most comparable GAAP measures. First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 increased 4% to $97.7 million compared to $93.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. The increase was attributable to strong growth from the Company's Concrete Waste Management Services and U.K. operations segments that was partially offset by a decrease in volumes in U.S. Concrete Pumping due to extreme winter weather events in the month of January. Gross profit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 decreased 9% to $33.3 million compared to $36.5 million in the prior year quarter. Gross margin was 34.1% compared to 39.0% in the prior year quarter, primarily related to lower equipment and labor utilization as a result of the extreme winter weather, in addition to inflationary increases in insurance costs. General and administrative expenses in the first quarter were $31.9 million compared to $27.0 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to (1) a non-recurring charge of $3.5 million as a result of a state sales tax dispute as discussed in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K, and (2) higher labor, health insurance and rent costs. As a percentage of revenue, G&A costs were 32.7% in the first quarter compared to 28.9% in the prior year quarter. Net loss in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $3.8 million compared to net income of $6.5 million in the prior year quarter. Net loss attributable to common shareholders in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $4.3 million, or $(0.08) per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $6.0 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 decreased 23.0% to $19.3 million compared to $25.0 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined to 19.7% compared to 26.8% in the prior year quarter. Both declines were primarily driven by the aforementioned impacts from extreme weather conditions, as well as inflationary increases related to insurance and increased costs related to labor. Liquidity On January 31, 2024, the Company had debt outstanding of $388.0 million, net debt of $373.3 million and total available liquidity of $217.0 million. Segment Results U.S. Concrete Pumping. Revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 0.8% to $66.7 million compared to $67.2 million in the prior year quarter. Severe winter temperatures and freezing rainfall in the month of January stalled many customer projects, driving a revenue decline of approximately $7.0 million from the loss of volume. Net loss in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $6.8 million compared to a net loss of $0.8 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $10.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to $16.8 million in the prior year quarter, largely driven by the revenue shortfall and downstream impacts on labor utilization. U.K. Operations. Revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 increased 21.2% to $15.4 million compared to $12.7 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact from foreign currency translation, revenue was up 16% year-over-year. The increase was primarily attributable to pricing improvements. Net income in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 improved to $0.5 million compared to a net loss of $0.1 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, up 32.8% compared to $2.4 million in the prior year quarter due to rate per hour and fuel price improvements. U.S. Concrete Waste Management Services. Revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 increased 14.2% to $15.6 million compared to $13.7 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by strong organic growth and pricing improvements, notwithstanding the Q1 growth rate being hampered by unseasonably harsh January winter weather. Net income in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $2.4 million compared to $2.8 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $5.4 million compared to $5.8 million in the prior year quarter due to the downstream winter weather impact on labor utilization. Fiscal Year 2024 Outlook Due to the weather impacted year-to-date start in fiscal 2024, the Company has revised its outlook and now expects fiscal year 2024 revenue to range between $460.0 million to $480.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA to range between $122.0 million to $130.0 million. The Company maintains its original outlook for free cash flow2 to be at least $75.0 million. 2 Free cash flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less net replacement capital expenditures less cash paid for interest. Share Repurchase Program In March 2024, CPH's board of directors approved a $15.0 million increase to the Company’s share repurchase program. This authorization will expire on March 31, 2025 and is in addition to the repurchase authorization of up to $10.0 million through March 31, 2025, that was previously approved in January 2023. During the first three months of fiscal year 2024, the Company repurchased 36,094 shares for a total of $0.2 million at an average share price of $6.88 per share. Including the new authorization of $15.0 million under the March 2024 approval, a total of $23.2 million would have been available for purchase under the Company's repurchase program as of January 31, 2024.

Forward‐Looking Statements This press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company’s actual results may differ from expectations, estimates and projections and consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” “outlook” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the Company’s expectations with respect to future performance, including the Company's fiscal year 2024 outlook. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results. Most of these factors are outside the Company’s control and are difficult to predict. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: the adverse impact of recent inflationary pressures, global economic conditions and developments related to these conditions, such as fluctuations in fuel costs on our business; the outcome of any legal proceedings or demand letters that may be instituted against or sent to the Company or its subsidiaries; the ability of the Company to grow and manage growth profitably and retain its key employees; the ability to complete targeted acquisitions and to realize the expected benefits from completed acquisitions; changes in applicable laws or regulations; the possibility that the Company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the risk factors in the Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The Company cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. The Company does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release presents Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, net debt and free cash flow, all of which are important financial measures for the Company, but are not financial measures defined by GAAP. EBITDA is calculated by taking GAAP net income and adding back interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by taking EBITDA and adding back transaction expenses, loss on debt extinguishment, stock-based compensation, changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities, other income, net, goodwill and intangibles impairment and other adjustments. Transaction expenses represent expenses for legal, accounting, and other professionals that were engaged in the completion of various acquisitions. Transaction expenses can be volatile as they are primarily driven by the size of a specific acquisition. As such, the Company excludes these amounts from Adjusted EBITDA for comparability across periods. Other adjustments include the adjustments for warrant liabilities revaluation, non-recurring expenses and non-cash currency gains/losses. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends related to our financial condition and results of operations, and as a supplemental tool for investors to use in evaluating our ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with competitors who also present similar non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, these measures (1) are used in quarterly and annual financial reports and presentations prepared for management, our board of directors and investors, and (2) help management to determine incentive compensation. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain cash expenses that the Company is obligated to make. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently or may not calculate it at all, which limits the usefulness of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as comparative measures. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue for the period presented. See below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP. Net debt is calculated as all amounts outstanding under debt agreements (currently this includes the Company’s term loan and revolving line of credit balances, excluding any offsets for capitalized deferred financing costs) measured in accordance with GAAP less cash. Cash is subtracted from the GAAP measure because it could be used to reduce the Company’s debt obligations. A limitation associated with using net debt is that it subtracts cash and therefore may imply that there is less Company debt than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. CPH believes this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to management and investors in order to monitor the Company’s leverage and evaluate the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. See “Non-GAAP Measures (Reconciliation of Net Debt)” below for a reconciliation of Net Debt to amounts outstanding under debt agreements calculated in accordance with GAAP. The leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing four quarters. The Company believes its leverage ratio measures its ability to service its debt and its ability to make capital expenditures. Additionally, the leverage ratio is a standard measurement used by investors to gauge the creditworthiness of an institution. Free cash flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less net replacement capital expenditures and cash paid for interest. This measure is not a substitute for cash flow from operations and does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since certain non-discretionary expenditures, such as debt servicing payments, are not deducted from the measure. CPH believes this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to management and investors in order to monitor and evaluate the cash flow yield of the business. The financial statement tables that accompany this press release include a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and net debt to the applicable most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. However, the Company has not reconciled the forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA guidance range and free cash flow range included in this press release to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the lack of predictability regarding the various reconciling items such as provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Current and prospective investors should review the Company’s audited annual and unaudited interim financial statements, which are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, net debt and free cash flow differently and therefore these measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

"Trinity Industries, Inc. Declares Quarterly Dividend",2024-03-07T21:05:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Trinity Industries, Inc. (TRN) announces a quarterly dividend of 28 cents per share on its common stock, marking the 240th consecutive dividend payment.

Declares Quarterly Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Trinity Industries, Inc. (TRN) announces a quarterly dividend of 28 cents per share on its common stock, marking the 240th consecutive dividend payment. The dividend will be paid on April 30, 2024, to stockholders of record on April 15, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst When evaluating the implications of Trinity Industries' announcement of a quarterly dividend, it's important to consider the signals it sends to the market. A consistent dividend payout, especially one that's been maintained for 240 consecutive quarters, demonstrates a stable cash flow and a commitment to shareholder returns. It can be a sign of the company's financial health and a mature business model. However, investors should also review the dividend yield and payout ratio in comparison to industry standards to assess sustainability. High payout ratios may not be sustainable in the long run and a yield significantly higher than peers could indicate the stock is undervalued or that the market expects future dividend cuts or capital challenges. Market Research Analyst The declaration of a dividend can also impact investor sentiment and stock performance. Dividends are often factored into valuation models and thus, a consistent dividend can make the stock more attractive to income-focused investors. The market's reaction to such announcements can vary and it's worthwhile to monitor the stock's performance post-announcement for any significant changes. Additionally, the historical context of Trinity's dividend policy may provide insights into the company's strategic priorities, such as whether they are choosing to return cash to shareholders over reinvesting in growth opportunities. Economist From an economic perspective, the declaration of dividends by corporations like Trinity Industries can be a reflection of broader economic conditions. In a stable or growing economy, companies may have more confidence in their future earnings, allowing them to allocate funds for shareholder dividends. Conversely, in a downturn, dividends might be reduced as companies conserve cash. Thus, the maintenance of a dividend could suggest management's positive outlook on economic conditions and the company's operational resilience. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Trinity Industries, Inc.

Immersion returned $15.7 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends in 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst Immersion Corporation's financial results indicate a mixed performance, with total revenues and royalty and license revenues showing an increase in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. This suggests a positive trend in the company's core business operations. However, the year-over-year increase in both GAAP and Non-GAAP operating expenses could raise concerns about cost management and its impact on profitability.The company's strategy to repurchase shares represents a capital allocation decision that typically signals confidence in the company's value by its management. The repurchase of 1% of shares outstanding in Q4 and 3.9% over the full year at average prices below the industry average P/E ratio could be perceived as a smart move to enhance shareholder value, assuming the shares were undervalued.Net income figures for the year show an improvement despite the decrease in revenues from 2022 to 2023, which could indicate better overall efficiency or the realization of gains from other financial activities. Investors would be interested in understanding the drivers behind the increased net income despite reduced revenues. Market Research Analyst Immersion Corporation operates in the haptics technology sector, which is becoming increasingly relevant in various industries such as gaming, automotive and mobile devices. The company's ability to maintain and renew license deals is crucial for sustained revenue streams. The reported increase in stockholder's equity suggests a stronger financial position, which could attract investors looking for companies with solid balance sheets.The announcement of the sixth consecutive quarterly dividend and the increase in stockholder's equity demonstrates a commitment to returning value to shareholders. However, the Board's statement regarding the potential adjustment or withdrawal of future dividends indicates a cautious approach to capital allocation, which might reflect underlying uncertainty about future financial performance or strategic investments. Legal Expert The focus on enforcing intellectual property rights, as stated by the CEO, is significant for a technology company like Immersion. Intellectual property is a critical asset that can provide competitive advantage and revenue through licensing. The legal strategies to protect and leverage these assets can have direct implications on the company's financial health and market position.Furthermore, the company's governance practices, including the Board's discretion over quarterly dividends and capital allocation, are important for investor confidence. Transparency and prudent decision-making in these areas can impact investor perception and, subsequently, stock performance. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM Fourth Quarter GAAP Net Income of $16.0 million or $0.49 per diluted share Fourth Quarter Non-GAAP Net Income of $16.9 million or $0.52 per diluted share Repurchased 1% of shares outstanding AVENTURA, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Immersion Corporation (NASDAQ: IMMR), a leading developer and provider of technologies for haptics, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Immersion reports all financial information required in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but it believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may be difficult to understand if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Immersion discloses this non-GAAP information, such as Non-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP operating expenses and Non-GAAP net income per diluted share because it is useful in understanding the company’s performance as it excludes certain non-cash expenses like stock-based compensation expense and other special charges, depreciation and restructuring costs, that many investors feel may obscure the company’s true operating performance. Likewise, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported results under GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to their closest GAAP financial measures in tables contained in this press release.

The potential best-in-class profile of neffy aims to improve patient compliance and ease of use, offering rapid effects within minutes and eliminating needle-related risks. The company expects FDA approval in the second half of 2024, with plans for significant market expansion. Positive clinical data for urticaria treatment further enhances neffy's potential. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The introduction of neffy, an investigational nasal spray form of epinephrine, represents a significant potential shift in the management of severe Type I allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. The current landscape for epinephrine administration is dominated by autoinjectors, which, while effective, present barriers to compliance due to their needle-based delivery system. The data indicating that 80-90% of patients with a prescription for epinephrine do not use it as directed suggests a substantial market for alternative delivery systems that address these barriers.From a medical research perspective, the high reliability and ease of use reported for neffy could lead to improved patient outcomes. Rapid effects, high bioavailability and a favorable safety profile are critical for emergency treatments. If neffy's clinical data holds up under FDA scrutiny and it gains approval, it could set a new standard for epinephrine delivery, potentially improving the rate at which prescriptions are not only filled but also carried and used correctly by patients. Market Research Analyst ARS Pharma's projections for neffy suggest a substantial expansion of the epinephrine market, potentially growing from five million two-pack autoinjector units sold annually to over 14 million by 2034. This growth is predicated on neffy's ease of use and needle-free design, which could increase compliance and market penetration. Given that nearly half of the current prescription holders are children, a non-invasive alternative could be particularly influential in driving adoption.The company's anticipation of an FDA action date and potential launch in the second half of 2024, coupled with the review by the European Medicines Agency, indicates a strategic move to tap into both U.S. and European markets. The expansion into the treatment of urticaria further illustrates ARS Pharma's intent to broaden neffy's therapeutic applications, which could have a significant impact on the company's market share and revenue growth. Healthcare Economist The potential introduction of neffy into the market could have economic implications for the healthcare system. By addressing the unmet need for a needle-free epinephrine delivery system, neffy may lead to better management of severe allergic reactions, which in turn could reduce emergency room visits and hospitalizations. This improved management could translate into cost savings for both patients and insurers.However, the pricing strategy of neffy will be a critical factor in assessing its economic impact. If priced competitively with existing autoinjectors, neffy could achieve wide adoption and substantial cost-effectiveness. Conversely, if it enters the market at a premium, it may face barriers to adoption despite its advantages, potentially limiting its impact on healthcare costs. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM Significant unmet need with 80-90% of patients with current epinephrine Rx not using as directed, and only ~15% of diagnosed severe Type I allergy population with a current epinephrine prescriptionMultiple favorable attributes and potential best-in-class profile of neffy highlighted at the eventPotential for epinephrine market to significantly expand from today due to availability of neffy SAN DIEGO, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ARS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: SPRY), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to empowering at-risk patients and caregivers to better protect patients from severe allergic reactions that could lead to anaphylaxis, today hosted an investor event highlighting neffy® (epinephrine nasal spray), an investigational new drug, for the treatment of Type I allergic reactions. The event included presentations by members of the ARS Pharma management team and by two distinguished allergists, Dr. Jonathan Spergel, M.D., Ph.D. and Dr. Thomas B. Casale, M.D. “During our neffy Investor Day, we highlighted the substantial unmet need faced by patients suffering from severe allergies, and how current epinephrine treatments, while effective, have limitations – largely stemming from needle-related risks and portability issues,” said Richard Lowenthal, Co-Founder, President and CEO of ARS Pharma. “Dr. Spergel and Dr. Casale discussed the limitations of today’s needle-based treatments and how a product with neffy’s profile increases the likelihood that patients will easily carry and confidently administer epinephrine without anxiety or hesitation. We believe we have addressed the deficiencies identified in FDA’s CRL for neffy, and we expect to submit a response early in the second quarter of 2024 and, if approved, look forward to bringing this innovative treatment to patients.” Dr. Jonathan Spergel, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Pediatrics and Chief of the Allergy Program at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, commented, “Epinephrine has been used for more than 100 years and we know that it is an effective treatment to reverse the symptoms of anaphylaxis, yet approximately 40% of patients do not fill their epinephrine prescriptions. Of the patients that do fill their prescription, 80-90% either do not carry or use their treatment as indicated. Prompt administration of epinephrine is the most critical factor that translates to better efficacy, regardless of device. The availability of an additional epinephrine option will help with compliance, especially with respect to children who account for almost half of the population with active prescriptions today.” Multiple Favorable Attributes of neffy’s potential Profile, if approved, Highlighted during Investor Day Effectiveness and ReliabilitySafetyEase of UseRapid effects within minutes based on pharmacodynamic response observed even 1 minute after dosing, as well as oral food challenge anaphylaxis and treatment-refractory chronic spontaneous urticaria efficacy dataWell-tolerated – mild nasal discomfort (9.7%) and mild headache (6%) are the most frequent adverse events (>5%)Ease of use with 100% of untrained adults and children in human factors studies able to successfully dose neffy99.999% reliable device with proven use in emergency settings – tens of millions of units sold each year across seven other FDA approved productsNo needle eliminates risk of needle-related injuries and accidental blood vessel injectionsPortable – two neffy’s fit easily in your pocketConsistent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile within the range of approved injection products even for repeat dosing and under challenge conditions such as rhinitisHigh bioavailability with low 2 mg dose that minimizes risk of overexposure and side effects that mimic anaphylaxis such as vomiting and GI symptomsAbility to dose not interfered by frequently observed anaphylaxis symptoms1such as vomiting (~20%), angioedema of the face, lips, tongue or larynx (~45%) or difficulty breathing (~55%) No meaningful pain or irritation as assessed by formal scales (mean visual analogue scale, or VAS, scores of 5 to 8 out of 100)Positive palatability with no taste or smell 1 Frequency of symptoms observed during anaphylaxis based on an analysis of 4,805 cases reported in peer-reviewed journal publications In September 2023, ARS Pharma announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) issued a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) regarding its New Drug Application (“NDA”) for neffy. ARS Pharma believes it has successfully addressed the deficiencies identified in the CRL and expects to submit a response early in the second quarter of 2024. Following an expected up to six-month review period, ARS Pharma anticipates an FDA action date and potential launch of neffy in the second half of 2024. The marketing authorization application (“MAA”) for neffy is also under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) with a decision expected in the second quarter of 2024. Additional submissions to other foreign regulatory authorities are planned for 2024. Dr. Thomas B. Casale, M.D., Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics and Chief of the Allergy & Immunology Division at University of South Florida, added, ""To consider recommending a novel epinephrine delivery product to the allergy patients in our clinics, I need to know that the product works, that it is safe and that patients will actually use it during an episode. neffy, if approved, would not only offer a rapid and reliable response in reversing anaphylaxis symptoms, but its benign side effect profile combined with a portable, easy to use design make this an attractive option for the severe allergy community that is eagerly awaiting a needle-free epinephrine treatment option. I am confident that patients will have a higher likelihood of filling their neffy prescription, and that they will more frequently carry their device and be less hesitant to use neffy shortly after symptom onset.” Eric Karas, ARS Pharma’s Chief Commercial Officer, noted, “Roughly 20 million patients in the U.S. have been formally diagnosed with severe Type 1 allergies. There is a substantial opportunity to penetrate and significantly expand the epinephrine treatment market, starting with the more than six million patients today that either do not fill their epinephrine prescription, do not use their current device at all, or use their device incorrectly. During the Investor Day, we outlined in detail how we expect neffy’s favorable attributes, combined with promotion and population growth, may potentially expand today’s epinephrine market from the approximately five million two-pack autoinjector units sold annually in the U.S. today, to over 14 million two-pack units by 2034. Having a device that is needle-free, easy to carry and easy to use, we expect patients will be more likely to have neffy with them when an allergic reaction occurs and be less hesitant to use the device at symptom onset.” In addition to severe Type I allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, ARS Pharma is actively developing neffy for the treatment of urticaria. In late-February, the Company announced positive clinical data from a Phase 2 trial evaluating neffy in adults with chronic spontaneous urticaria. ARS Pharma plans to initiate an outpatient urticaria study in patients treated with antihistamines who experience frequent acute flares later in 2024, potentially followed by initiation of a single pivotal efficacy study.

About Type I Allergic Reactions including Anaphylaxis Type I severe allergic reactions are serious and potentially life-threatening events that can occur within minutes of exposure to an allergen and require immediate treatment with epinephrine, the only FDA-approved medication for these reactions. While epinephrine autoinjectors have been shown to be highly effective, there are well published limitations that result in many patients and caregivers delaying or not administering treatment in an emergency situation. These limitations include fear of the needle, lack of portability, needle-related safety concerns, lack of reliability, and complexity of the devices. There are approximately 40 million people in the United States who experience Type I severe allergic reactions. Of those, only 3.3 million currently have an active epinephrine autoinjector prescription, and of those, only half consistently carry their prescribed autoinjector. Even if patients or caregivers carry an autoinjector, more than half either delay or do not administer the device when needed in an emergency. About UrticariaUrticaria is a skin disorder that causes itchy hives and/or angioedema. Approximately 50% of chronic urticaria cases are non-responsive to first-line antihistamine therapy. These non-responsive patients on stable therapy regimens can experience exacerbations or flares several times a year among acute cases, and even several times a week, including up to three or four emergency room visits, among chronic urticaria cases. About ARS Pharmaceuticals, Inc.ARS Pharma is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to empowering at-risk patients and caregivers to better protect themselves from severe allergic reactions that could lead to anaphylaxis. The Company is developing neffy® (also referred to as ARS-1), an intranasal epinephrine product in clinical development for patients and their caregivers with Type I allergic reactions including food, medications and insect bites that could lead to life-threatening anaphylaxis.

The Business to Business Products Group saw a 3% revenue increase, while the Retail and Wholesale Products Group experienced a 4% growth in revenues. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Oil-Dri Corporation of America's reported second quarter net sales increase of 4% and a net income surge of 221% over the previous year are significant indicators of the company's current financial health and operational efficiency. The substantial growth in net income, even after excluding nonrecurring events, is particularly noteworthy, indicating a robust underlying business performance. This performance is further underscored by an impressive gross profit increase of 34%, leading to a gross margin expansion from 22.6% to 29.3% year-over-year. Such an expansion suggests effective cost management and pricing strategies in the face of potential inflationary pressures.Investors may find the record sales in fluids purification products, driven by increased demand for renewable diesel and other applications, as a positive sign of diversification and adaptability in Oil-Dri's product portfolio. The company's ability to acquire new customers in this sector could imply a strengthening market position and potential for future revenue streams. However, the decline in agricultural and animal health businesses warrants attention, as it may indicate challenges in these segments that could offset gains in other areas if not addressed.From a liquidity perspective, the increase in cash and cash equivalents is a positive signal, enhancing the company’s financial flexibility. The strategic use of this cash for capital investments and dividend payouts reflects a balanced approach to growth and shareholder returns. Investors should monitor the effectiveness of these capital investments in improving manufacturing infrastructure and whether they lead to sustained improvements in efficiency and profitability. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in net sales and income for Oil-Dri Corporation of America is reflective of broader industry trends, where companies with diversified product lines and innovative offerings, such as renewable diesel, are outperforming. The company's strategic focus on gross margin improvement through better product mix and pricing strategies is in line with industry best practices for enhancing profitability.However, the segment-specific performance reveals that success is not uniform across all product lines. The growth in fluids purification and cat litter products contrasts with declines in the agricultural and animal health businesses. This suggests a potential need for strategic reassessment in the underperforming segments, which could involve re-evaluating product offerings, market approach, or operational efficiency.Furthermore, the increase in SG&A expenses, particularly due to advertising, indicates an aggressive marketing strategy. While this could bolster brand recognition and drive sales, it also raises the cost structure, which investors should consider when assessing the sustainability of profit margins. The company's ability to leverage third-party research data, showing an increase in market share within the lightweight litter segment, demonstrates a keen understanding of market dynamics and consumer trends. Legal Expert The financial results of Oil-Dri Corporation of America include references to non-GAAP financial measures. While these are common in financial reporting to provide additional insight into a company's performance, it is crucial that these measures are reconciled with GAAP measures, as the company has done. This transparency allows stakeholders to fully understand the basis of the company's reported financial health.It is also important to note the company's strategic shift in sales through Oil-Dri's subsidiary in China to a master distributor model. This change could have implications for future revenue recognition and international trade compliance. As geopolitical tensions and trade regulations evolve, the company's ability to adapt its international sales strategy will be critical to maintaining growth and minimizing legal and regulatory risks.Additionally, the mention of the newly launched EPA-approved Cat’s Pride Antibacterial Clumping Litter highlights the company's compliance with environmental regulations, which is increasingly important to consumers and investors alike. This compliance with regulatory standards not only mitigates legal risks but can also enhance the brand's reputation and competitive edge in the market. 03/07/2024 - 04:06 PM CHICAGO, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oil-Dri Corporation of America (NYSE: ODC), producer and marketer of sorbent mineral products, today announced results for its second quarter and first six-months of fiscal year 2024.

Daniel S. Jaffee, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “I am pleased to report another exceptional quarter, marked by growth in consolidated net sales, gross profit, and net income. Increased sales of renewable diesel and cat litter products pushed our revenues to record highs for the second quarter. Our strategic initiatives to improve gross margins yielded positive results in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 which generated cash to help fund the replacement of aging manufacturing assets. Our net income more than tripled in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to the prior year. These achievements can be attributed to our team’s ongoing dedication and the diverse product offerings derived from our unique minerals. In the periods ahead, we remain committed to sustaining this momentum, investing in our manufacturing infrastructure, and delivering our value- added products and services to our loyal customers.” Consolidated ResultsConsolidated net sales reached $105.7 million, a 4% increase over the prior year, which was a record for the second quarter. This growth was primarily driven by elevated sales of fluids purification and cat litter products, including co-packaged items. Revenues from industrial & sports products remained flat, while sales from the animal health and agricultural businesses declined in the second quarter compared to last year. Higher prices across all principal products helped contribute to the improvement in net sales, as well as increased volumes within the Business to Business (“B2B”) Products Group. Consolidated gross profit of $30.9 million was an all-time high for the second quarter, an increase of $7.9 million, or 34%, over the prior year. Gross margins expanded to 29.3% in fiscal 2024 from 22.6% in fiscal 2023. This increase was driven by higher selling prices across multiple products and improved product mix. During the three months ended January 31, 2024, domestic cost of goods sold per ton increased by 1% compared to the prior year. This was a result of higher per ton freight and non-fuel manufacturing costs, such as labor and repairs, which offset lower natural gas and packaging costs. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $15.8 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and remained relatively flat compared to the same period last year. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, consolidated operating income more than doubled to $15.2 million from $7.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Total other expense, net was $500,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2024 compared to total other expense, net of $2.3 million in the same period last year. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded a reserve of $2.5 million for modification costs to address capacity issues at its sole landfill located in Ochlocknee, Georgia. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the landfill reserve accrual was increased, but partially offset by higher interest income. Income tax expense increased to $2.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to $1.2 million in the same period last year due to the Company’s higher taxable income. The Company set a record for the highest second quarter net income attributable to Oil-Dri of $12.4 million in fiscal 2024, more than triple the prior year’s second quarter bottom line of $3.9 million. Excluding nonrecurring items, net income attributable to Oil-Dri for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $12.8 million compared to $5.8 million in the same period last year, or a 120% increase. Cash and cash equivalents for the three month period ending January 31, 2024, totaled $27.8 million compared to $14.0 million in the prior year. This $13.8 million increase was driven by higher earnings. Significant uses of cash during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 include capital investments for manufacturing infrastructure improvements and dividends. Product Group ReviewThe Business to Business Products Group’s second quarter of fiscal 2024 revenues were $36.2 million, or 3% higher than the prior year, driven primarily from an increase in volume, and to a lesser extent, from higher prices. Elevated revenues from fluids purification products more than offset sales declines in the agricultural and animal health businesses. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, revenues from fluid purification products reached a record $22.7 million, or a 19% increase over the prior year. This was primarily due to increased demand for renewable diesel, edible oil, and jet fuel products within North America, combined with higher prices in the region. The Company acquired several new customers as a result of the recently established renewable diesel plants within the U.S. which helped drive this growth. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, sales of agricultural products were $9.3 million, or a 5% decrease from the prior year. This decline was a result of softer volumes. Amlan International, the Company’s animal health business, generated $4.2 million in sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2024, reflecting a 33% decrease from last year. Despite this decline, double digit revenue gains were achieved within North America where the Company has made significant investments to grow the business. Sales improved within this region through higher prices and increased demand of Sorbiam products. These gains were more than offset by revenue declines within Asia (including China), Latin America, and Mexico as a result of timing of orders and lower demand. Due to the transition from sales through Oil-Dri’s subsidiary in China to a master distributor model, future sales to China will be directly through the Company and captured under the Asia region. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, SG&A costs within the B2B Products Group increased by $200,000, or 7%, over the prior year. This was mainly driven by higher compensation-related expenses, partially offset by a reduction in the allocation of technical support costs. Operating income for the B2B Products Group was $11.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to $7.7 million in fiscal 2023, reflecting a 42% increase. This $3.3 million gain can be attributed to higher sales and a favorable product mix, partially offset by elevated SG&A expenses. The Retail and Wholesale (“R&W”) Products Group’s second quarter revenues reached $69.4 million, a 4% increase over the prior year. This increase was driven by higher prices across product offerings. A significant portion of this growth can be attributed to record high sales from co-packaged coarse cat litter products. A combination of higher prices and the shift in the timing of sales from a key customer who was impacted by a cyberattack during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 generated these sales gains. In addition, domestic cat litter sales, excluding the Company’s co-packaged coarse cat litter business, grew to $50.2 million, or a 3% increase over the prior year. Higher prices across the domestic cat litter product portfolio drove the increase. Revenues from combined domestic branded and private label lightweight litter items rose 3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 versus the prior year. However, retail sales of these products grew 8% compared to the lightweight litter segment sales growth of 7% for the 13-week period ended January 27, 2024, according to third-party research data for retail sales1. While shipment growth trailed the lightweight litter segment consumption growth this quarter, the Company continued to increase its share of the lightweight litter segment. In addition, Oil-Dri expanded distribution of its newly launched EPA approved Cat’s Pride Antibacterial Clumping Litter. Sales of both branded and private label coarse cat litter increased during the second quarter compared to the same period last year. Domestic industrial and sports product revenues were $9.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and flat compared to the prior year. Sales from the Company’s Canadian subsidiary also remained relatively flat in the three months ended January 31, 2024, compared to the same period last year. Slightly higher revenues from cat litter products were offset by softer sales from industrial floor absorbents. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, SG&A expenses within the R&W Products Group increased by $800,000 or 25% over the prior year. This was driven by higher advertising costs to promote Cat’s Pride lightweight litter, including the newly launched Cat’s Pride Antibacterial Clumping Litter product. The Company expects advertising costs for the full fiscal year 2024 to be higher than fiscal year 2023, though spread more evenly over four quarters. Operating income for the R&W Products Group reached $11.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to $8.7 million in the prior year, reflecting a 37% increase. This $3.2 million increase can be attributed to higher sales, partially offset by increased cost of goods sold and SG&A expenses. Oil-Dri will host its second quarter of fiscal year 2024 earnings discussion via a live webcast on Friday, March 8, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time.

Financial Analyst The financial results reported by Evolus indicate a significant improvement in operational efficiency, as evidenced by the lowest quarter of non-GAAP operating loss since the company's inception and an operating cash flow of $0.8M in Q4 2023. The reduction in operating loss by $2 million compared to Q3 and the alignment of full-year operating expenses within the provided guidance range demonstrate prudent financial management and cost control measures. The reported global net revenue growth of 40% for Q4 and 36% for the full year reflects a robust demand for the company's products and successful market penetration strategies.For investors and stakeholders, the mid-term guidance update suggesting profitability by Q4 2024 and FY 2025 is a critical indicator of the company's future financial health and operational performance. This projection could influence investor sentiment and stock valuation, as profitability milestones are often viewed as pivotal for growth-stage companies. However, it is essential to monitor the company's ability to maintain revenue growth and manage expenses to achieve these profitability targets. Market Research Analyst Evolus' positioning as the fastest growing toxin in the U.S. for the third consecutive year suggests a strong competitive advantage and brand recognition in the performance beauty industry. The expansion of the product portfolio to include an innovative line of facial fillers could cater to a broader customer base and represents a strategic move to capitalize on the growing demand for minimally invasive cosmetic procedures. The projected net revenue guidance for the full year 2024 indicates an ambitious but potentially attainable 31% growth, which may be driven by both the existing toxin products and the new facial fillers.Market trends in the aesthetics industry show an increasing consumer preference for non-surgical procedures, which could benefit Evolus as it expands its offerings. However, the success of these products in a competitive market will depend on the effectiveness of the company's marketing strategies, the reception of the new products by healthcare providers and the ability to navigate regulatory hurdles in different geographies. Medical Research Analyst The addition of an innovative late-stage line of facial fillers to Evolus' portfolio is noteworthy from a medical research perspective. Facial fillers are a significant component of the aesthetic medicine market and innovations in this space can offer improved results, reduced side effects and better patient satisfaction. The company's focus on delivering breakthrough products may indicate a commitment to research and development, which is essential for maintaining a competitive edge in the performance beauty sector.It is important to consider the regulatory landscape for medical devices and pharmaceuticals, as the approval and commercial success of new medical products are contingent upon stringent clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The company's ability to navigate this process efficiently can have a profound impact on its financial performance and market share growth. Stakeholders should pay close attention to the clinical trial results and regulatory milestones of the new facial fillers to assess the potential impact on the company's growth trajectory. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM Generated $0.8M of Cash from Operating Activities in Q4 2023 Recorded Lowest Quarter of Non-GAAP Operating Loss Since Inception, Non-GAAP Operating Loss for Q4 is $3.7 Million, an Improvement of $2 Million Compared to Q3 Full Year 2023 Operating Expense of $163.9 Million in Alignment with Guidance Range of $160 Million to $165 Million Global Net Revenue Record of $61.0 Million for the Fourth Quarter and $202.1 Million Full Year 2023, Representing 40% and 36% Growth Over the Prior Year; These Results Are Unchanged from the Preliminary Results Reported on January 16th, 2024 Company Updates Mid-Term Guidance and Expects to Achieve Profitability1 for the Fourth Quarter of 2024 and Full Year 2025 NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Evolus, Inc. (NASDAQ: EOLS), a performance beauty company with a customer-centric approach focused on delivering breakthrough products, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. “2023 was a defining year for Evolus. We achieved record market share as the fastest growing toxin in the U.S. for the third consecutive year2, expanded our portfolio globally with the addition of an innovative late-stage line of facial fillers, and delivered continued improvement in operating income performance,” said David Moatazedi, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evolus. “We expect to be profitable1 for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the full year 2025.” “As we enter 2024, we are reiterating our full year net revenue guidance of $255 million to $265 million, which represents 31% growth at the top end of the range. Looking beyond 2024, we remain excited about both the continued expansion of our U.S. and International business with the Jeuveau® and Nuceiva® brands, as well as the introduction of our highly synergistic Evolysse™ and Estyme® dermal filler line, further increasing our market penetration and driving toward our total net revenue goal of at least $700 million by 2028.” Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Highlights and Recent Developments The company’s key performance indicators demonstrated continued strong momentum during the fourth quarter. Accounts purchasing Jeuveau® increased by a record high of more than 840 in the fourth quarter. This is 20% above the year-to-date quarterly average in the company’s seasonally highest performance quarter. During 2023, more than 2,900 new accounts were added, bringing the total number of accounts purchasing to date since launch to more than 12,400. The reorder rate among customers remains approximately 70%.3 Enrollment in the Evolus Rewards consumer loyalty program grew 55% in 2023 to end the year at approximately 750,000 consumers.4 This was aided by a record high of over 170,000 total redemptions in the fourth quarter, driven by continued demand from existing consumers receiving repeat treatments. Repeat treatments represented approximately 60% of the total treatments for the quarter, demonstrating strong brand loyalty. Expanded global footprint by successfully commencing the commercial launch of Nuceiva® in major European markets, including Germany, Austria and Italy. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Total net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased 40% to $61.0 million from $43.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 driven primarily by higher volumes of Jeuveau®. Gross profit margin and adjusted gross profit margin were 67.2% and 68.4%, respectively. Adjusted gross profit margin excludes amortization of intangible assets. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $69.6 million, compared to $63.5 million in the third quarter of 2023; Q4 2023 operating expenses included $4.4 million of IPR&D expense related to the Share Issuance for the European Filler License Agreement. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $45.5 million, compared to $40.3 million in the third quarter of 2023; Q4 2023 Non-GAAP operating expenses included $4.4 million of IPR&D expense related to the Share Issuance for the European Filler License Agreement. Non-GAAP operating expenses exclude product cost of sales, stock-based compensation expense, revaluation of the contingent royalty obligation, and depreciation and amortization. Loss from operations for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $8.6 million, compared to $13.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP loss from operations in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $3.7 million, compared to $5.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP loss from operations excludes stock-based compensation expense, revaluation of the contingent royalty obligation, and depreciation and amortization. Cash and cash equivalents on December 31, 2023 were $62.8 million, compared to $38.7 million on September 30, 2023. The cash balance on December 31, 2023 included additional borrowings of $25.0 million under the company’s credit facility with Pharmakon; $0.8 million of cash was generated from operations in the fourth quarter. This continued improvement in cash generation demonstrates progress towards cash flow breakeven. Evolus continues to expect its existing liquidity will fully fund it to sustained profitability1 in 2025. Full Year 2023 Financial Results Total net revenues for 2023 increased 36% to $202.1 million, surpassing the top end of the company’s updated guidance of $194 million to $198 million introduced in November 2023, reflecting increasing consumer demand and market share gains. Gross profit margin and adjusted gross profit margin were 68.1% and 69.5%. Adjusted gross profit margin, which excluded amortization of intangibles, is aligned with company guidance of 68% to 71%. Operating expenses were $251.3 million in 2023, compared to $213.9 million in 2022. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $163.9 million in 2023 and in alignment with company guidance range of $160 million to $165 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses for 2022 were $137.7 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses exclude product cost of sales, stock-based compensation expense, revaluation of the contingent royalty obligation, and depreciation and amortization. Loss from operations was $49.2 million for 2023, compared to $65.3 million in 2022. Non-GAAP loss from operations in 2023 decreased by 48% to $23.4 million from $45.0 million in 2022. Non-GAAP loss from operations excludes stock-based compensation expense, revaluation of the contingent royalty obligation expense, and depreciation and amortization. Outlook Evolus expects total net revenues for the full year 2024 to be between $255 and $265 million, representing year-over-year growth of 26% to 31% from 2023 results and well above the estimated growth rate of the aesthetic neurotoxin market. Evolus expects its adjusted gross profit margin for the full year 2024 to be between 68% and 71%, consistent with 2023 guidance. Evolus expects its full year non-GAAP operating expenses to be between $185 and $190 million. The company expects to achieve positive non-GAAP operating income on a consolidated basis for the fourth quarter of 2024 and for the full year 2025. Within the year 2025, profitability1 may not be sustained every quarter due to the filler launch. The company remains fully funded with existing liquidity. The company projects its total net revenue can reach at least $700 million by 2028, a compound annual growth rate of 28% from 2023, based on the combination of its existing aesthetic neurotoxin business and anticipated launch of the Evolysse™ HA dermal filler product line beginning in 2025. During 2024, Evolus expects to broaden its global footprint by expanding into additional countries with Nuceiva®, most notably Australia and Spain. Evolus anticipates submitting Premarket Approval (PMA) applications for the first two Evolysse™ dermal filler products with the FDA by mid-year 2024 and expects regulatory approvals for the remaining Estyme® dermal filler products in Europe in late 2024. 1 Within this press release, “profitability” is defined as achieving positive non-GAAP operating income. 2 Measured by comparing year-over-year revenue growth of each aesthetic neurotoxin on the market for the entirety of each comparable year. 3 Represents cumulative statistics from the launch of Jeuveau® in May 2019 through December 31, 2023. 4 Represents cumulative statistics from the launch of Evolus Rewards in May 2020 through December 31, 2023.

Visit us at www.evolus.com, and follow us on LinkedIn, X, Instagram or Facebook. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Evolus’ financial results are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). This press release and the reconciliation tables included in the financial schedules below include adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP income (loss) from operations. Adjusted gross profit is calculated as gross profit excluding amortization of an intangible asset. Adjusted gross profit margin is defined as adjusted gross profit as a percentage of total net revenues. Non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP income (loss) from operations exclude (i) product cost of sales, in the case of non-GAAP operating expenses only, (ii) the revaluation of contingent royalty obligations, (iii) stock-based compensation expense, and (iv) depreciation and amortization. Management believes that adjusted gross profit margin is an important measure for investors because management uses adjusted gross profit margin as a key performance indicator to evaluate the profitability of sales without giving effect to costs that are not core to our cost of sales, such as the amortization of an intangible asset. Management believes that non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP income (loss) from operations are useful in helping to identify the company’s core operating performance and enables management to consistently analyze the period-to-period financial performance of the core business operations. Management also believes that non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP income (loss) from operations will enable investors to assess the company in the same way that management has historically assessed the company’s operating expenses against comparable companies with conventional accounting methodologies. The company’s definitions of adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP income (loss) from operations have limitations as analytical tools and may differ from other companies reporting similarly named measures. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered measures of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from such non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to financial statement data presented in the financial statements as an indicator of financial performance or liquidity.

Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Financial Analyst The financial results of Limoneira Company reveal a strategic shift towards an 'asset-lighter' business model, which is a significant move for the agribusiness sector. This approach typically involves reducing capital-intensive activities, which can lead to improved profitability and return on assets. The reported 5% decrease in agribusiness costs and expenses, coupled with an 84% improvement in agribusiness operating loss, suggests that the company is successfully implementing cost control measures and enhancing operational efficiency. However, it is important to note the significant operating loss reported in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, which was $7.7 million compared to an operating income of $25.9 million in the previous year, largely due to the gain on the sale of Northern Properties. This variance could be a point of concern for investors, as it indicates that without one-off gains, the company's core operations are not yet profitable.Investors should also consider the reported increase in net revenues and the performance of specific segments like brokered lemons and farm management revenues. The increase in average price per carton of lemons sold indicates a positive pricing environment, which could be beneficial if sustained. However, the delay in lemon picking due to increased rainfall could affect second-quarter results and the seasonality of the avocado market should be monitored for its impact on future revenues. The company's liquidity position, with a net cash used in operating activities of $10.3 million, down from $21.2 million in the prior year, reflects an improved cash flow situation, although the increase in long-term debt to $51.4 million warrants attention. Market Research Analyst The agribusiness industry is known for its susceptibility to environmental factors and Limoneira's first-quarter results are a testament to this, with rainfall affecting lemon harvest timing. While this is a short-term challenge, it does not seem to have long-term repercussions on the overall harvest quality. The company's focus on expanding avocado production could be a strategic move to diversify its product portfolio and reduce reliance on lemon sales. This is particularly relevant given the lack of import pressure from Mexico and Peru, which may present an opportunity for Limoneira to capture a larger share of the U.S. market during certain periods.The real estate development aspect of Limoneira's operations also presents an interesting dynamic. The residential development project Harvest at Limoneira shows potential for significant cash inflows, with the company expecting to receive $131 million spread over nine fiscal years. The expansion of residential units from 1,500 to 2,050 units could signal confidence in the real estate market and the company's ability to capitalize on its real estate assets. However, investors should be cautious and consider the cyclical nature of real estate and the execution risks associated with such large-scale developments. Agricultural Economist The agribusiness sector operates on thin margins and is highly sensitive to changes in input costs, environmental conditions and market demand. Limoneira's strategic shift toward an 'asset-lighter' model typically allows for more flexible responses to market conditions and can be a prudent approach to managing the inherent volatility of the sector. The company's improvement in agribusiness operating loss and cost reductions is indicative of a potentially more sustainable operational structure. However, the emphasis on expanding avocado production must be viewed within the context of global supply chains and market demand. While avocados have seen growing popularity, overproduction can lead to price drops, which could offset the benefits of increased volumes.Furthermore, the company's guidance on lemon and avocado volumes provides a forecast for investors, but it is essential to consider the risks associated with agricultural yields, such as disease, pests and climate variability. The expectation of strong organic growth supported by non-bearing lemons and avocados becoming full-bearing is optimistic, but it also depends on successful cultivation and market conditions at the time of harvest. The company's exploration of strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value is a critical point for investors, as it may lead to restructuring, mergers, or acquisitions, each with its own set of financial implications. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM Net Revenues Grew 5% to $39.7 Million in First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 Compared to Prior Year Strategic Shift Toward Higher Margin “Asset-Lighter” Business Model Reflected in First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 Results; Agribusiness Operating Loss Improved 84% and Agribusiness Costs and Expenses Decreased 5% in First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 Compared to Prior Year Brokered Lemons and Other Lemon Sales Increased to $2.9 Million and Company Achieved $2.0 Million in Farm Management Revenue in First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 Company Reiterates Lemon and Avocado Volume Guidance for Fiscal Year 2024 Company Continues Exploration of Strategic Alternatives Intended to Maximize Stockholder Value SANTA PAULA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Limoneira Company (the “Company” or “Limoneira”) (Nasdaq: LMNR), a diversified citrus growing, packing, selling and marketing company with related agribusiness activities and real estate development operations, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended January 31, 2024. Management Comments Harold Edwards, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated, “We are very encouraged to see the Company’s strategic shift towards an “asset-lighter” business model reflected in our results, with agribusiness expenses decreasing by 5%, agribusiness operating loss improving by 84% and our adjusted EBITDA improving by 39% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to the prior year period. Going forward we expect continued improvement as the asset-lighter model starts to have a meaningful impact on our operating results. As part of the Company’s exploration of strategic alternatives to maximize value, we have decided it is in the best interest of our stockholders to temporarily pause the sale of the two remaining non-strategic assets, as well as move away from pursuing a packinghouse in Chile and instead add value by focusing on expanding our avocado production over the next three years.” Mr. Edwards continued, “Results for the first quarter were impacted by increased rainfall in California that delayed the picking of lemons from the first quarter to the second quarter; however, we do not expect the rainfall to have any other impact on the overall harvest or the quality of the fruit. Additionally, avocado harvests will begin in the second quarter and run into the third quarter due to the seasonality of California avocados and lack of import pressure from Mexico and Peru in the U.S. market during that period.” Fiscal Year 2024 First Quarter Results For the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, total net revenue increased 5% to $39.7 million, compared to total net revenue of $37.9 million in the first quarter of the previous fiscal year. Agribusiness revenue was $38.3 million, compared to $36.5 million in the first quarter of last fiscal year. Other operations revenue was $1.4 million in both the first quarters of fiscal years 2024 and 2023. Agribusiness revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 includes $23.9 million in fresh lemon sales, compared to $24.7 million of fresh lemon sales during the same period of fiscal year 2023. Approximately 1,137,000 cartons of U.S. packed fresh lemons were sold in aggregate during the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 at a $21.06 average price per carton, compared to approximately 1,308,000 cartons sold at a $18.88 average price per carton during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Brokered lemons and other lemon sales were $2.9 million and $1.4 million, in the first quarter of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recognized no avocado revenue in the first quarters of fiscal years 2024 and 2023 due to the timing of harvest. The Company recognized $1.1 million of orange revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, compared to $1.2 million in the same period of fiscal year 2023. Approximately 80,000 cartons of oranges were sold during the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 at a $14.26 average price per carton, compared to approximately 64,000 cartons sold at a $18.00 average price per carton during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Specialty citrus and other crops revenue was $1.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, compared to $1.2 million in the same period of fiscal year 2023. Farm management revenues were $2.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, primarily due to the Northern Properties farming, management and operations services. There were no farm management revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Total costs and expenses in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 were $47.5 million, compared to $12.0 million in the first quarter of last fiscal year. The increase of $35.5 million was primarily related to the gain on the sale of the Northern Properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, partially offset by decreases in agribusiness costs and expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating loss for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $7.7 million, compared to operating income of $25.9 million in the first quarter of the previous fiscal year, which was primarily related to the gain on the sale of the Northern Properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Net loss applicable to common stock, after preferred dividends, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $3.7 million, compared to net income applicable to common stock of $15.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Net loss per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $0.21, compared to net income per diluted share of $0.84 for the same period of fiscal year 2023. Adjusted net loss for diluted EPS in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $3.2 million or $0.18 per diluted share, compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 of $9.3 million or $0.53 per diluted share.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $8.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $66.3 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year. On January 31, 2023, the Company sold its Northern Properties, which resulted in total net proceeds of $98.4 million. The proceeds were used to pay down all of the Company’s domestic debt except the AgWest Farm Credit $40.0 million non-revolving line of credit with an interest rate that is fixed at 3.57% through July 1, 2025. Long-term debt as of January 31, 2024, was $51.4 million, compared to $40.6 million at the end of fiscal year 2023. Debt levels as of January 31, 2024, less $0.5 million of cash on hand, resulted in a net debt position of $51.6 million at quarter end. Real Estate Development and Property Sales The Company’s joint venture with The Lewis Group of Companies (“Lewis”) for the residential development of its East Area I real estate development project, named Harvest at Limoneira, is currently expected to have approximately 1,500 total residential units built and sold over the life of the project.

The company scaled its omnichannel strategy with additional stores, marketplace, and wholesale opportunities in 2024.

Positive 12% growth in U.S. net sales compared to Q4 2022 Strengthened balance sheet through $50.7 million debt paydown in FY23 Scaling omnichannel strategy with additional stores, marketplace, and wholesale opportunities in 2024 Adjusted EBITDA improvement for fiscal 2024 Negative Decrease in net sales for full year 2023 Financial Analyst The reported financial results reveal a nuanced picture of a.k.a. Brands Holding Corp.'s performance. While the U.S. net sales growth of approximately 12% is a positive signal, the overall net sales decrease of 0.1% in Q4 and 10.7% for the full year suggests a challenging market environment. The substantial debt paydown of $50.7 million is a strong move towards financial stability and could be viewed positively by investors, indicating a more conservative capital structure and potentially lower financial risk going forward.The scaling of the omnichannel strategy represents a strategic investment in future growth, aiming to capture a larger share of the market through physical stores and online marketplaces. However, the costs associated with this expansion, including capital expenditures of approximately $10 million to $12 million, will need to be carefully managed to ensure they do not overly burden the balance sheet. The company's outlook for FY24, with net sales projected between $540 million and $555 million and adjusted EBITDA between $16 million and $18 million, suggests cautious optimism but also reflects the ongoing macroeconomic pressures, especially in the Australian and New Zealand markets. Retail Industry Analyst From a retail industry perspective, a.k.a. Brands' focus on omnichannel retailing is in line with broader industry trends where integrating online and offline experiences is critical for customer engagement. The planned opening of three to four Princess Polly stores in the second half of 2024, as well as the expansion into marketplaces such as Nordstrom's website, are strategic steps to enhance brand visibility and accessibility. Nevertheless, these initiatives come with inherent risks, including the cost of physical store operations and the potential for inventory management challenges.The reduction in year-end inventory by 28% compared to the previous year indicates a proactive approach to inventory optimization, which is crucial for maintaining healthy cash flows and avoiding markdowns. The company's performance in the U.S. market, with double-digit net sales growth, contrasts with the softness in Australia and New Zealand, highlighting the importance of geographic diversification in mitigating regional economic downturns. Market Research Analyst Examining the consumer behavior trends, the decline in the number of orders and average order value during Q4 suggests that a.k.a. Brands may be facing headwinds in consumer spending, likely due to broader economic factors. The targeted discounting strategy in Culture Kings Australia, while necessary to stimulate demand, has contributed to a lower gross margin. This strategy, coupled with a higher merchandise return rate, could indicate shifting consumer preferences or a misalignment with market expectations.The company's marketing expenses, which increased to 11.6% of net sales compared to 10.3% in the previous year, reflect an intensified effort to attract customers amid a competitive landscape. It will be crucial for a.k.a. Brands to monitor the effectiveness of these marketing investments to ensure they translate into sustainable sales growth without eroding profitability. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM U.S. Net Sales Grew ~12% Compared to the Fourth Quarter of 2022 Strengthened Balance Sheet Through $50.7 Million Debt Paydown in FY23 Scaling Omnichannel Strategy through Additional Stores, Marketplace and Wholesale Opportunities in 2024 SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- a.k.a. Brands Holding Corp. (NYSE: AKA), a brand accelerator of next generation fashion brands, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights Net sales decreased 0.1% to $148.9 million, compared to $149.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022; and was flat on a constant currency basis1. In the U.S., net sales increased 11.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Net loss was $(13.9) million, or $(1.31) per share, and (9.3%) of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to net loss of $(173.9) million, or $(16.26) per share, and (116.6%) of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA2 was $1.3 million, or 0.9% of net sales, compared to $6.1 million, or 4.1% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2022. Fiscal 2023 Financial Highlights Net sales decreased 10.7% to $546.3 million, compared to $611.7 million in 2022; and decreased 8.7% on a constant currency basis1. Net loss was $(98.9) million, or $(9.24) per share, and (18.1%) of net sales in 2023, compared to net loss of $(176.7) million, or $(16.47) per share, and (28.9%) of net sales in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA2 was $13.8 million, or 2.5% of net sales, compared to $31.9 million, or 5.2% of net sales in 2022. “2023 was a transformational year for a.k.a. Brands, and I want to thank our teams for their continued dedication to building next-generation fashion brands for the next generation of consumers,” said Ciaran Long, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. “I’m pleased that we delivered net sales growth in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2023, which marks the second consecutive quarter of growth in our largest market. I’m proud of the teams’ strong execution across regions, which enabled us to reduce our year-end inventory by 28% compared to last year. Additionally, we continued to manage the business prudently and strengthened our balance sheet - we paid off more than $50 million of debt this year, effectively reducing our debt by 35% in fiscal 2023.” “As we look ahead, we will continue to deepen our relationships with customers by delivering fashion newness, launching new categories and leveraging innovative technologies. Additionally, based on the success of our omnichannel tests in 2023, we are expanding our omnichannel initiatives in 2024 with the opening of three to four Princess Polly stores and new marketplace and wholesale opportunities to attract new customers and expand our total addressable market. And lastly, we remain committed to streamlining our operations to deliver long-term profitable growth,” concluded Long. Recent Brand Highlights Princess Polly will expand its omnichannel strategy and open three to four stores in the second half of 2024, including signed leases for stores in Boston and San Diego. Culture Kings U.S. registered double-digit net sales growth in 2023 and continues to disrupt the streetwear market with its one-of-a-kind store experience and marketing activations. Petal & Pup continues to expand its marketplace presence and launched on Nordstrom’s website in the first quarter of 2024, adding to the brands successful marketplace tests on Macy’s and Target’s websites. mnml continues to be a highly-sought after streetwear brand and remains a top-selling brand at the Culture Kings store in the U.S. Fourth Quarter Financial Details Net sales decreased 0.1% to $148.9 million, compared to $149.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease was driven by a decline in the number of orders and average order value during the quarter, primarily driven by adverse macroeconomic conditions in Australia and New Zealand. On a constant currency1 basis, net sales were flat. Gross margin was 51.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 52.8% in the same period last year. The decline was primarily driven by targeted discounting in Culture Kings Australia and a higher merchandise return rate, partially offset by lower freight expenses. Selling expenses were $42.3 million, compared to $39.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Selling expenses were 28.4% of net sales, compared to 26.2% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to softness in Australia and New Zealand. Marketing expenses were $17.3 million, compared to $15.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Marketing expenses were 11.6% of net sales, compared to 10.3% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2022. General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses were $22.3 million, compared to $26.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. G&A expenses were 15.0% of net sales, compared to 17.5% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2022. The decline in G&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to a decrease in wages and benefits and a decrease in insurance costs. Adjusted EBITDA2 was $1.3 million, or 0.9% of net sales, compared to $6.1 million, or 4.1% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full year 2023 financial details are included in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fourth quarter totaled $21.9 million, compared to $46.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. Inventory at the end of the fourth quarter totaled $91.0 million, compared to $126.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. Inventory decreased $8.9 million, or 9%, from the end of the third quarter of 2023. Debt at the end of the fourth quarter totaled $93.4 million, compared to $143.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. Cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $33.4 million, compared to cash used in operations of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Outlook For the full year fiscal 2024, the Company expects: Net sales between $540 million and $555 million Adjusted EBITDA3 between $16 million and $18 million Weighted average diluted share count of 10.7 million Capital expenditures of approximately $10 million to $12 million For the first quarter of 2024, the Company expects: Net sales between $108 million and $112 million Adjusted EBITDA3 between $0.3 million and $0.7 million Weighted average diluted share count of 10.5 million The above outlook is based on several assumptions, including but not limited to, foreign exchange rates remaining at the current levels, the opening of three to four Princess Polly stores and continued macroeconomic pressures, specifically in Australia and New Zealand.

In any particular period, we determine our number of active customers by counting the total number of unique customer accounts who have made at least one purchase in the preceding 12-month period, measured from the last date of such period. Average Order Value We define average order value (“AOV”) as net sales in a given period divided by the total orders placed in that period. AOV may fluctuate as we expand into new categories or geographies or as our assortment changes. a.k.a. BRANDS HOLDING CORP. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (in thousands, except per share data) (unaudited) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures that management uses to assess our operating performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin facilitate internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use these measures for business planning purposes. We also believe this information will be useful for investors to facilitate comparisons of our operating performance and better identify trends in our business. We expect Adjusted EBITDA margin to increase over the long-term as we continue to scale our business and achieve greater leverage in our operating expenses. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude: interest and other expense; provision for (benefit from) income taxes; depreciation and amortization expense; equity-based compensation expense; costs to establish or relocate distribution centers; transaction costs; costs related to severance from headcount reductions; goodwill and intangible asset impairment; sales tax penalties; insured losses, net of any recoveries; and one-time or non-recurring items. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are considered non-GAAP financial measures under the SEC’s rules because they exclude certain amounts included in net income (loss) and net income (loss) margin, the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net loss $ (13,883 ) $ (173,896 ) $ (98,886 ) $ (176,697 ) Add (deduct): Total other expense, net 2,741 2,053 13,556 8,575 Provision for (benefit from) income tax 5,754 (3,713 ) 1,921 (3,917 ) Depreciation and amortization expense 4,446 4,975 19,141 20,348 Equity-based compensation expense 2,162 2,282 7,640 6,730 Inventory step-up amortization expense — — — 707 Transaction costs — — — 140 Goodwill impairment — 173,786 68,524 173,786 Non-routine items5 119 606 1,894 2,200 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,339 $ 6,093 $ 13,790 $ 31,872 Net loss margin (9.3 )% (116.6 )% (18.1 )% (28.9 )% Adjusted EBITDA margin 0.9 % 4.1 % 2.5 % 5.2 % Net Income (Loss), As Adjusted and Net Income (Loss) Per Share, As Adjusted Net income (loss), as adjusted and net income (loss) per share, as adjusted are considered non-GAAP financial measures under the SEC’s rules because they exclude certain amounts included in net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share calculated in accordance with GAAP, the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that net income (loss), as adjusted, and net income (loss) per share, as adjusted, are meaningful measures to provide investors because they better enable comparison of the performance with that of the comparable period. In addition, net income (loss), as adjusted and net income (loss) per share, as adjusted, afford investors a view of what management considers to be a.k.a.’s core earnings performance, thereby providing investors the ability to make a more informed assessment of such core earnings performance with that of the prior year. We have calculated net loss, as adjusted and net loss per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2023, by adjusting net loss and net loss per share for the following: Loss on disposal of the Rebdolls reporting unit; and Impairment recognized on the goodwill recorded from the acquisitions of the Culture Kings and Petal & Pup reporting units, which is a result of the continued worsening global economic trends, elevated interest rates and unfavorable demand in Australia. A reconciliation of non-GAAP net loss, as adjusted to net loss, as well as the resulting calculation of net loss per share, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2023, are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2023 Net loss $ (98,886 ) Adjustments: Loss on disposal of the Rebdolls reporting unit 951 Goodwill impairment 68,524 Tax effects of adjustments — Net loss, as adjusted $ (29,411 ) Net loss per share, as adjusted $ (2.75 ) Weighted-average shares, diluted 10,707,024 We have calculated net loss, as adjusted and net loss per share, as adjusted for the three months and year ended December 31, 2022, by adjusting net loss and net loss per share for the following: Inventory step-up amortization expense resulting from the acquisition of mnml; Impairment recognized on the goodwill recorded from the acquisitions of the Culture Kings and Rebdolls reporting units, which is a result of the worsening economic trends, including continued inflation and rising interest rates, as well as unfavorable demand due to a gradual customer shift from primarily online shopping to a mix of online and physical store shopping; and The tax benefit related to the finalization of Australia tax basis allocation pertaining to the inventory and intangibles included in the purchase of the Culture Kings non-controlling interest, as well as an intra-entity transfer of intellectual property rights.

Pro Forma Net Sales Pro forma net sales is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC’s rules. We believe that pro forma net sales is useful information for investors as it provides a better understanding of sales performance, and relative changes therein, on a comparable basis. We calculate pro forma net sales as net sales including the historical net sales relating to the pre-acquisition periods of Culture Kings, assuming that the Company acquired Culture Kings at the beginning of the period presented. Pro forma net sales is not necessarily indicative of what the actual results would have been if the acquisition had in fact occurred on the date or for the periods indicated nor does it purport to project net sales for any future periods or as of any date. A reconciliation of non-GAAP pro forma net sales to net sales, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, in each case disaggregated by geography, for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2021 is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2023 Year Ended December 31, 2021 Growth Rate Actual Actual Culture Kings Pro Forma Actual Pro Forma U.S. $ 315,496 $ 270,028 $ 7,669 $ 277,697 16.8 % 13.6 % Australia/New Zealand 202,777 265,365 43,314 308,679 (23.6 )% (34.3 )% Rest of world 27,985 26,798 280 27,078 4.4 % 3.3 % Total $ 546,258 $ 562,191 $ 51,263 $ 613,454 (2.8 )% (11.0 )% 1 In order to provide a framework for assessing the performance of our underlying business, excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period using a constant currency methodology wherein current and comparative prior period results for our operations reporting in currencies other than U.S. dollars are converted into U.S. dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on December 31, 2022, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. 2 See additional information at the end of this release regarding non-GAAP financial measures. 3 The Company has not provided a quantitative reconciliation of its Adjusted EBITDA outlook to a GAAP net income (loss) outlook because it is unable, without making unreasonable efforts, to project certain reconciling items. These items include, but are not limited to, future equity-based compensation expense, income taxes, interest expense and transaction costs. These items are inherently variable and uncertain and depend on various factors, some of which are outside of the Company’s control or ability to predict. See additional information at the end of this release regarding non-GAAP financial measures. 4 Trailing twelve months. 5 Non-routine items include costs to establish or relocate distribution centers; severance from headcount reductions; sales tax penalties; insured losses, net of recoveries; and non-routine legal matters.

The significant increase of 18.3% in Q4 revenues and the improvement in gross margin to 36.8% reflect a strong end to the year. These improvements are noteworthy as gross margins are crucial for profitability and an increase suggests better cost management or pricing strategies. However, the full-year revenue decline of 7.6% and the net losses reported both for the quarter and the full year highlight ongoing challenges.From an investor's perspective, the growth in Adjusted EBITDA by 82% in Q4 and 47% for the full year is encouraging as it suggests operational efficiency improvements. The fact that the company exceeded its prior guidance for fiscal 2023 may also instill confidence in management's ability to navigate a challenging industry environment. Nonetheless, the net losses indicate that despite operational efficiencies, the company is still facing difficulties in achieving profitability.Looking ahead, the guidance for 2024 suggests cautious optimism, with an expectation of growth in Adjusted EBITDA and further gross margin expansion. However, the anticipated softness in consumer demand for grills in 2024 could be a concern for revenue growth. Investors should monitor how the company's strategic growth initiatives, such as new product introductions and expansion into new categories, will counterbalance the soft market demand. Market Research Analyst Traeger's performance reflects broader trends in the consumer goods sector, particularly in the context of discretionary spending on items like grills. The increase in Q4 sales can be partially attributed to lapping retailer destocking from the previous year, which may not be indicative of underlying consumer demand. The growth in accessories revenue, driven by sales of MEATER smart thermometers, suggests that there is a consumer appetite for innovative cooking tools that enhance the grilling experience.The contrast between North America and Rest of World revenues, with the former seeing a decrease and the latter an increase, could indicate geographic shifts in market demand or success in international market penetration strategies. Companies in the consumer goods sector often face different market dynamics in international markets and Traeger's ability to grow revenues outside of North America could be a positive sign for diversification of revenue streams.The company's strategic inventory management, resulting in a significant reduction in inventory levels, is a positive step towards improving cash flow and reducing storage costs. However, it will be crucial to balance inventory levels to meet any unexpected increases in demand, especially as the company enters its peak selling season. Supply Chain Analyst The gross margin expansion Traeger has achieved can be partly attributed to favorability from freight and logistics costs. This suggests that the company has effectively navigated the global supply chain disruptions that have impacted many industries. The reduction in transportation costs is a positive development, potentially reflecting either successful negotiations with carriers or a strategic shift in logistics operations.The significant decrease in inventory levels from the previous year-end indicates a strong focus on inventory optimization. This is beneficial for reducing carrying costs and minimizing the risk of obsolescence, particularly for a company dealing with consumer products that may be subject to seasonal demand fluctuations. However, it is important to ensure that such reductions do not lead to stockouts, which could harm sales, especially during peak seasons.Given the forward-looking guidance, stakeholders should consider the company's expectations of continued improvements in gross margin due to lower transportation costs and margin enhancement initiatives. If these expectations are met, it could signal a more resilient and adaptable supply chain that could support profitability even in the face of soft consumer demand. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM Provides Guidance for 2024 SALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Traeger, Inc.

""Fourth quarter sales were up 18.3% versus prior year, driven by strong growth in our grills business as we lapped retailer destocking in the fourth quarter of last year as well as growth in our accessories business."" Mr. Andrus continued, ""In 2023, we made significant progress in the face of a challenging industry environment. Our efforts to rightsize inventories and to drive Adjusted EBITDA through gross margin expansion and cost discipline have put Traeger in a materially improved financial position versus a year ago. Moreover, we continued to make progress on our long-term growth initiatives in 2023, including product innovation with the introduction of our new Ironwood and Ironwood XL grills, our entrance into the griddle category and the launch of MEATER 2 Plus."" ""Looking to 2024, we will be focused on our strategic growth pillars and executing against our plan to drive household penetration. While we anticipate that consumer demand for grills will remain soft in 2024, we are guiding to growth in Adjusted EBITDA driven by our expectation for meaningful gross margin expansion. As we head into our peak selling season in the coming months, I am as confident as ever in the Traeger brand and believe that we remain well-positioned to deliver strong long-term value to our shareholders, consumers and retail partners,"" said Mr. Andrus. Operating Results for the Fourth Quarter Total revenues increased by 18.3% to $163.5 million, compared to $138.1 million in the fourth quarter last year. Grills revenues increased 23.9% to $59.9 million, compared to $48.3 million in the fourth quarter last year. The increase was driven by higher unit volumes, partially offset by a decrease in average selling price due to strategic pricing actions. Consumables revenues increased 0.5% to $24.6 million, compared to $24.4 million in the fourth quarter last year. The increase was driven by higher average selling prices of wood pellets as well as higher volumes of food consumables, partially offset by lower average selling prices of food consumables and lower volumes of wood pellets. Accessories revenues increased 20.9% to $79.0 million, compared to $65.4 million in the fourth quarter last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales of MEATER smart thermometers as well as growth of Traeger branded accessories. North America revenues increased 12.8% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Rest of World revenues increased 59.2% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Gross profit increased to $60.1 million, compared to $47.6 million in the fourth quarter last year. Gross margin was 36.8% in the fourth quarter, inclusive of an impact of 100 basis points related to the voluntary recall of the Flatrock Griddle in the quarter. This compared to 34.5% in the same period last year or 34.9% excluding restructuring costs.2 The increase in gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2023 was driven primarily by favorability from freight and logistics costs. Sales and marketing expenses were $32.8 million, compared to $28.3 million in the fourth quarter last year. The increase was driven primarily by higher variable costs. General and administrative expenses were $25.9 million, compared to $24.2 million in the fourth quarter last year. The increase in general and administrative expense was driven primarily by higher professional service fees, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense. Net loss was $24.0 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $28.9 million, or $0.24 per diluted share,1 in the fourth quarter last year. Adjusted net loss was $9.5 million, or $0.08 per diluted share as compared to adjusted net loss of $13.2 million, or $0.11 per diluted share in the fourth quarter last year.2 Adjusted EBITDA was $13.0 million compared to $7.1 million in the fourth quarter last year.2 Operating Results for the Full Year ended December 31, 2023 Total revenues decreased by 7.6% to $605.9 million, compared to $655.9 million last year. Grills revenues decreased 15.8% to $299.3 million, compared to $355.4 million last year. The decrease was driven primarily by lower unit volume from retail destocking in the first half of fiscal year 2023 as well as a decrease in average selling price due to strategic pricing actions. Consumables revenues decreased 12.5% to $114.9 million, compared to $131.3 million last year. The decrease was driven primarily by a reduction in unit volume of wood pellets and food consumables, as well as a reduction in average selling price of food consumables. Accessories revenues increased 13.3% to $191.6 million, compared to $169.1 million last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher sales of MEATER smart thermometers. North America revenues decreased 10.4% compared to the prior year. Rest of World revenues increased 21.6% compared to the prior year. Gross profit decreased to $223.6 million, compared to $228.8 million last year. Gross profit margin was 36.9%, inclusive of 30 basis points related to the voluntary recall of the Flatrock Griddle in the fourth quarter. This compares to 34.9% last year or 35.2% excluding restructuring costs.2 The increase in gross margin was driven primarily by favorability from freight and logistics, partially offset by grill price changes. Sales and marketing expenses were $108.7 million, compared to $130.7 million last year. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in advertising costs, travel related expenses, commissions and other employee expenses, and professional fees. General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses were $129.8 million, compared to $166.8 million last year. The decrease in G&A expenses was driven primarily by the decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $34.7 million. Net loss was $84.4 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, as compared to net loss of $382.1 million, or $3.19 per diluted share,1 in the same period last year. Adjusted net loss was $27.0 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, as compared to adjusted net loss of $105.8 million, or $0.88 per diluted share in the same period last year.2 Adjusted EBITDA was $61.1 million compared to $41.5 million in the same period last year.2 Balance Sheet Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023 totaled $29.9 million, compared to $39.1 million at December 31, 2022. Inventory at December 31, 2023 was $96.2 million, compared to $153.5 million at December 31, 2022. The decrease was driven primarily by strategic inventory management. Guidance The company's outlook reflects its expectation for continued softness in grill industry demand in 2024, as well as its expectation for significant improvement in gross margin, driven by lower transportation costs and the benefit of margin enhancement initiatives. Guidance For Full Year Fiscal 2024 Total revenue is expected to be between $580 million and $605 million Gross margin is expected to be between 39% and 40% Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $62 million and $71 million Guidance For First Quarter 2024 Total revenue is expected to be between $140 million and $145 million Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $21 million and $24 million A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA guidance to Net Loss on a forward-looking basis cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts, as the Company is unable to provide reconciling information with respect to provision for income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, other (income) expense, goodwill impairment, stock-based compensation, non-routine legal expenses, change in fair value of contingent consideration, and other adjustment items all of which are adjustments to Adjusted EBITDA, respectively.

RECONCILIATIONS OF AND OTHER INFORMATION REGARDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (unaudited) In addition to our results and measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe that certain non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating and comparing our financial and operational performance over multiple periods, identifying trends affecting our business, formulating business plans and making strategic decisions. Each of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted Net Loss per share, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Loss Margin, and Adjusted Gross Margin are key performance measures that our management uses to assess our financial performance and is also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and other interested parties in analyzing our financial performance because it provides a comparable overview of our operations across historical periods. In addition, we believe that providing each of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Loss, together with a reconciliation of Net Loss to each such measure, and providing Adjusted Net Loss per share, together with a reconciliation of Net Loss per share to such measure, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Loss Margin, and Adjusted Gross Margin together with a reconciliation of Net Loss Margin and Gross Margin to such measures, helps investors make comparisons between our company and other companies that may have different capital structures, different tax rates, and/or different forms of employee compensation. For example, due to finite-lived intangible assets included on our balance sheet following our corporate reorganization in 2017, we have significant non-cash amortization expense attributable to the nature of our capital structure. Each of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted Net Loss per share, and Adjusted Gross Margin are used by our management team as an additional measure of our performance for purposes of business decision-making, including managing expenditures, and evaluating potential acquisitions. Period-to-period comparisons of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted Net Loss per share, and Adjusted Gross Margin help our management identify additional trends in our financial results that may not be shown solely by period-to-period comparisons of Net Loss or Loss from Continuing Operations or Net Loss per share. In addition, we may use Adjusted EBITDA in the incentive compensation programs applicable to some of our employees. Each of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted Net Loss per share, and Adjusted Gross Margin has inherent limitations because of the excluded items, and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled metrics used by other companies. The following table presents a reconciliation of Gross Margin, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to Adjusted Gross Margin on a consolidated basis. Three Months Ended December 31, Year-ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Gross margin 36.8 % 34.5 % 36.9 % 34.9 % Add: Impact of restructuring costs recorded in cost of revenue — % 0.4 % — % 0.3 % Adjusted gross margin 36.8 % 34.9 % 36.9 % 35.2 % The following table presents a reconciliation of Net Loss, Operating Loss, Net Loss Margin, Operating Loss Margin, and Net Loss per share, the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Loss Margin and Adjusted Net Loss per share, respectively, on a consolidated basis.

The amounts for the three months and year ended December 31, 2022 have been adjusted to reflect the application of the estimated blended statutory tax rates, as opposed to effective income tax rates that were used in prior periods, in order to include the current and deferred income tax expenses that are commensurate with the non-GAAP measure of profitability.

Despite challenges, the company demonstrated growth in net sales, adjusted EBITDA, and key performance indicators.","Snap One Reports Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Snap One Holdings Corp. reported financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year ended December 29, 2023, highlighting achievements, product launches, and financial outlook for Fiscal 2024. Despite challenges, the company demonstrated growth in net sales, adjusted EBITDA, and key performance indicators. Positive Snap One received multiple industry awards and accolades for its integrator partner experience and product suite. The company introduced innovative service offerings like Control4 Connect and Control4 Assist to enhance the end consumer experience. Snap One expanded its product portfolio with new offerings in outdoor audio, lighting, surveillance, and networking, catering to key growth markets. Despite global uncertainties, Snap One reported $1.061 billion in net sales for 2023, with a net loss of $21.4 million and adjusted EBITDA of $117.2 million. The fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 saw a 1.4% decrease in net sales, while adjusted EBITDA increased by 10.7% compared to the same period in the previous year. For fiscal 2024, Snap One expects net sales to range between $1.06 billion and $1.13 billion, with adjusted EBITDA projected to be between $120 million and $128 million. The company's stock repurchase program was extended, and Snap One remains confident in its long-term growth algorithm and strategic direction. Negative Net sales decreased by 5.6% in Fiscal Full Year 2023 compared to the previous year. The company reported a net loss of $21.4 million for 2023, representing an increase from the previous year. Adjusted net income decreased by 23.4% in Fiscal Full Year 2023 compared to the previous year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales in both the fiscal fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Financial Analyst Reviewing the financial health and strategic direction of Snap One Holdings Corp. reveals several noteworthy points. The company's net sales decrease of 5.6% year-over-year signals a contraction in revenue, which is a critical metric for assessing a company's growth trajectory. However, the increase in adjusted EBITDA by 2.7% suggests an improvement in operating efficiency, which could be attributed to the company's cost management strategies or a shift towards higher-margin products and services.It is important to highlight the mixed financial results. While the adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 11.0%, indicating a potentially healthier profit ratio, the net loss widened from the previous year. This divergence between profitability measures warrants a closer examination of the company's expense structure and revenue composition. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales could be a concern as it suggests rising costs that are not being offset by sales growth.Investors should consider the company's liquidity position, which appears strengthened with a higher cash and cash equivalents balance compared to the previous year. The stock repurchase program reflects management's confidence in the intrinsic value of the company, although the actual impact on shareholder value will depend on future performance and market conditions. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Snap One's position in the smart-living products and services industry is of interest. The launch of Control4 Connect and Control4 Assist, along with the introduction of various new products, indicates a strategic emphasis on innovation and customer experience. These initiatives are aimed at capturing additional market share and fostering customer loyalty through enhanced service offerings.The company's expansion of its local branch network and its focus on key growth markets, such as high-capacity surveillance solutions, suggest a targeted approach to scaling operations and diversifying its revenue streams. However, the reported decrease in spend per transacting domestic integrator, albeit a modest one, could signal a potential softening in market demand or increased competition affecting pricing power.Moreover, the fiscal 2024 financial outlook provided by the company projects a cautious stance, acknowledging the uncertain macroeconomic environment. Investors should note this conservative guidance, as it could impact the company's stock performance and investor sentiment in the near term. Legal Expert Regarding regulatory compliance, the use of non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA, contribution margin and free cash flow necessitates a transparent reconciliation to GAAP figures, as mandated by the SEC. This is essential for investor clarity and to avoid potential legal scrutiny. The company's adherence to these disclosure requirements is crucial for maintaining investor trust and avoiding legal complications.Additionally, the company's stock repurchase program, amended to extend its expiration date, must be executed in accordance with SEC Rule 10b-18 to ensure proper timing, pricing and volume of repurchases. This ensures that the buybacks do not manipulate the market price of the company's stock. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM Continued Industry Leadership Marked by Launch of Control4 Connect and Control4 Assist and Numerous Achievements Across Product Suite and Growth Verticals Company Introduces Financial Outlook for Fiscal 2024 CHARLOTTE, N.C. , March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Snap One Holdings Corp.

Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, including contribution margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and free cash flow. A non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial or operating performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use the following non-GAAP measures to help us monitor the performance of our business, identify trends affecting our business and assist us in making strategic decisions: Contribution margin, which is defined as net sales, less cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, divided by net sales. Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as net loss, plus interest expense, income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization, other expense (income), net, further adjusted to exclude equity-based compensation, acquisition- and integration-related costs and certain other non-recurring, non-core, infrequent or unusual charges as set forth in the reconciliation in this section below. Adjusted net income, which is defined as net loss, plus amortization, further adjusted to exclude equity-based compensation, acquisition- and integration-related costs, (income) expense related to the interest rate cap and certain non-recurring, non-core, infrequent or unusual charges, including the estimated tax impacts of these adjustments, as set forth in the reconciliation in this section below. Free cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures, which consist of purchases of property and equipment as well as purchases of information technology, software development, and leasehold improvements. Contribution margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and free cash flow are key measures used by management to understand and evaluate our financial performance, generate future operating plans, make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital, and analyze investments in initiatives that are focused on cultivating new markets for our products and services. We believe contribution margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and free cash flow are useful measurements for analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our markets as they help identify underlying trends that could otherwise be masked by certain expenses that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing performance. Contribution margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools. These measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, contribution margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics of other companies due to differences among the methods of calculation. Certain prior period Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income add-back amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the previously reported Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income totals.

Opened five new stores during the quarter, totaling 326 stores. Net income increased by 66.0% to $43.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 5.0% to $83.1 million. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in quarterly net sales and comparable store sales for Savers Value Village indicates a positive performance trajectory, which is noteworthy for investors evaluating the company's growth potential. A 4.4% rise in net sales, particularly in the retail sector, suggests effective inventory and sales management, as well as potentially successful marketing strategies. The increase in sales yield, defined as the revenue generated per unit of product (in this case, per pound), by 2.0% to $1.54 also points to improved operational efficiency or pricing strategies.The expansion of the store footprint, with five new stores opened, reflects a strategic growth initiative. However, it is crucial to assess the long-term sustainability of this expansion in the context of the retail market's shift towards e-commerce. The company's mention of a 'vertically integrated model' implies control over the supply chain, which can be a significant advantage in managing costs and adapting to demand fluctuations. Financial Analyst The substantial increase of 66.0% in net income is a strong indicator of the company's profitability and may influence investor sentiment. An increase from $26.4 million to $43.9 million in net income, especially in a single quarter, is exceptional and warrants a closer examination of cost management and operational leverage. The Adjusted EBITDA growth of 5.0% to $83.1 million, alongside a slight improvement in Adjusted EBITDA margin to 21.7%, suggests that the company is improving its profitability ratios, a key metric for investors assessing financial health.It is also important to note the impact of foreign currency rates, which had a minor negative influence on Adjusted EBITDA. This detail highlights the exposure to currency risk, which could be significant for companies with international operations. The adjusted financial metrics, such as Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA, exclude certain items that are typically considered non-recurring or not indicative of the company's core business performance, providing a clearer picture of ongoing operations. Economist The company's confidence in accelerating organic unit growth into the high-single-digit percent range reflects optimism about the broader economic environment and consumer spending patterns. Given that the retail sector is often sensitive to economic cycles, the company's performance can be a bellwether for discretionary spending. The mention of 'strong secular trends' suggests that the company is benefiting from broader, long-term shifts in consumer behavior, possibly related to sustainability and thrift shopping, which could have implications for the retail industry as a whole.Furthermore, the resilience mentioned by the CEO in the face of early-quarter weather impacts implies that the company has robust contingency plans and adaptability, which are critical in mitigating the effects of unforeseen external challenges. This resilience, coupled with investments in people, processes and technology, indicates a forward-looking approach that may contribute to the company's competitive advantage. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM Quarterly net sales increased 4.4% or 4.5% in constant currency1 Quarterly comparable store sales increased 2.6% Opened five new stores in the quarter BELLEVUE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Savers Value Village, Inc. (NYSE: SVV), (the “Company”) today announced financial results for the thirteen weeks ended December 30, 2023 (the “fourth quarter”) and the fifty-two weeks ended December 30, 2023 (“fiscal 2023”). Highlights for the Fourth Quarter of 2023, Compared to the Fourth Quarter of 2022 Net sales increased 4.4% to $382.8 million. Constant currency net sales1 increased 4.5% to $383.5 million. Comparable store sales increased 2.6%, with the U.S. and Canada up 3.1% and 2.0%, respectively. Sales yield2 increased 2.0% to $1.54 per pound. The Company opened five new stores during the fourth quarter, ending the fourth quarter with a total of 326 stores. Net income increased 66.0% to $43.9 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, from $26.4 million, or $0.18 per diluted share. Adjusted net income1 and Adjusted net income per diluted share1 were $25.4 million and $0.15, respectively. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”)1 increased 5.0% to $83.1 million, and Adjusted EBITDA margin1 increased 10 basis points to 21.7%. Adjusted EBITDA1 included a $0.1 million negative impact from changes in foreign currency rates. Mark Walsh, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We finished the year on a strong note and are pleased with the underlying performance and resiliency of our business. We believe our results, once again, demonstrate the power of our vertically integrated model – which allows us to align our processing levels with demand trends to generate strong profitability and cash flow. Despite some weather impact early in the fourth quarter, we delivered better than expected adjusted EBITDA of more than $83 million in the fourth quarter and $322 million in 2023.” Mr. Walsh continued, “With the strong secular trends and the investments in people, processes and technology we have made over the last few years, we are well-positioned to accelerate our organic unit growth up to the high-single-digit percent range over the next few years. We feel very good about our 22 planned store openings in 2024 and the tremendous growth opportunities ahead of us.” 1 Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, as well as amounts presented on a constant currency basis, are not measures recognized under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). For additional information on our use of non-GAAP financial measures, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”, “Constant Currency” and the accompanying financial tables which reconcile GAAP financial measures to these non-GAAP measures. 2 We define sales yield as retail sales generated per pound processed on a currency neutral and comparable store basis. Balance Sheet Highlights As of December 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents totaled $180.0 million, compared to $112.1 million as of December 31, 2022. As of December 30, 2023, the Company had total borrowings of $816.8 million outstanding and its net leverage, defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents, divided by Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve months, was 2.0x. There were no borrowings under the Company’s $75.0 million revolving credit facility as of December 30, 2023. On January 30, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to its Senior Secured Credit Facilities resulting in a reduction of approximately 175 basis points on existing borrowings under the Term Loan Facility as a result of a reduction in the margin at the time of the reprice, the elimination of the SOFR adjustment margin and an additional reduction of the margin conditional on the Company achieving certain public corporate family ratings, which condition was met during February when Moody’s upgraded the Company’s corporate family rating to B1 Stable from B2 Stable. On March 4, 2024, the Company redeemed $49.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes. Subsequent to the redemption, the Company had total borrowings of $767.3 million outstanding. Fiscal 2024 Outlook The Company expects the following for the fifty-two weeks ending December 28, 2024 (“fiscal 2024”): The opening of approximately 22 new stores; Total net sales of approximately $1.57 to $1.59 billion; Comparable store sales growth of approximately 2% to 3%; Net income of approximately $78 million; Adjusted net income1 of approximately $123 million; Adjusted EBITDA2 of approximately $340 million; Capital expenditures in the range of $105 to $115 million; and GAAP-based diluted weighted average common shares outstanding of approximately 172 million. 1 Adjusted net income is not a measure recognized under U.S. GAAP. For additional information on our use of non-GAAP financial measures, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below and the accompanying financial tables which reconcile GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures. 2 We have not reconciled guidance for Adjusted EBITDA to the corresponding GAAP financial measure because we cannot determine the probable significance of the various reconciling items, as certain items are outside of our control and cannot be reasonably predicted due to the fact that these items could vary significantly period to period. Accordingly, reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measure is not available without unreasonable effort.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements can be identified by words such as “could,” “may,” “might,” “will,” “likely,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “continues,” “projects” and similar references to future periods, or by the inclusion of forecasts or projections, the outlook for the Company’s future business, prospects, financial performance, including its fiscal 2024 outlook or financial guidance, and industry outlook. Forward-looking statements are based on the Company’s current expectations and assumptions regarding its business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, by their nature, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. As a result, the Company’s actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the impact on both the supply and demand for the Company’s products caused by general economic conditions and changes in consumer confidence and spending; the Company’s ability to anticipate consumer demand and to source and process a sufficient quantity of quality secondhand items at attractive prices on a recurring basis risks related to attracting new, and retaining existing customers, including by increasing acceptance of secondhand items among new and growing customer demographics; risks associated with its status as a “brick and mortar” only retailer and its lack of operations in the growing online retail marketplace; its failure to open new profitable stores, or successfully enter new markets on a timely basis or at all; the risks associated with doing business with international manufacturers and suppliers including, but not limited to, transportation and shipping challenges, regulatory risks in foreign jurisdictions (particularly in Canada, where the Company maintains extensive operations) and exchange rate risks, which the Company may not be able to fully hedge; the loss of, or disruption or interruption in the operations of, its centralized distribution centers; risks associated with litigation, the expense of defense, and the potential for adverse outcomes; its failure to properly hire and to retain key personnel and other qualified personnel; risks associated with the timely and effective deployment, protection, and defense of computer networks and other electronic systems, including e-mail; changes in government regulations, procedures and requirements; its ability to maintain an effective system of controls and produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations; and risks associated with heightened geopolitical instability due to the conflicts in the Middle East and Eastern Europe; outbreak of viruses or widespread illness, including the continued impact of COVID-19 and continuing or renewed regulatory responses thereto; ; together with each of the other factors set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” in its filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Any forward-looking statement made by us in this press release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause the Company’s actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. The Company is not under any obligation (and specifically disclaims any such obligation) to update or alter these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company include Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin. The Company has included these non-GAAP financial measures in this press release as they are key measures used by its management and its board of directors to evaluate its operating performance and the effectiveness of its business strategies, make budgeting decisions, and evaluate compensation decisions. Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures, including those amounts presented in accordance with the Company’s definitions of Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, as they may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by its competitors, because not all companies and analysts calculate Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in the same manner. Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin alongside other financial performance measures, including, as applicable, net income and the Company’s other GAAP results. The Company presents Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin because we consider these meaningful measures to share with investors because they best allow comparison of the performance of one period with that of another period. In addition, by presenting Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, we provide investors with management’s perspective of the Company’s operating performance. Adjusted net income is defined as net income excluding the impact of loss on extinguishment of debt, IPO-related stock-based compensation expense, transaction costs, dividend-related bonus, (gain) loss on foreign currency, net, certain other adjustments, the tax effect on the above adjustments, and non-recurring tax benefit. The Company defines Adjusted net income per diluted share as Adjusted net income divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding the impact of interest expense, net, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization, loss on extinguishment of debt, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash occupancy-related costs, lease intangible asset expense, pre-opening expenses, store closing expenses, executive transition costs, transaction costs, dividend-related bonus, gain (loss) on foreign currency, net, and certain other adjustments. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales, expressed as a percentage. Constant Currency The Company reports certain operating results on a constant-currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of its results without regard to the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. The term foreign currency exchange rates refer to the exchange rates used to translate the Company's operating results for all countries where the transactional currency is not the U.S. Dollar into U.S. Dollars. Because the Company is a global company, foreign currency exchange rates used for translation may have a significant effect on its reported results. In general, the Company's financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. Dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. Dollar. References to operating results on a constant-currency basis mean operating results without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company believes disclosure of constant-currency results is helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of its results by increasing the transparency of the underlying performance by excluding the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. However, constant-currency results are non-GAAP financial measures and are not meant to be considered as an alternative or substitute for comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Constant-currency results have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP, are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Constant-currency results have limitations in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. During the thirteen and fifty-two weeks ended December 30, 2023, as compared to the thirteen and fifty-two weeks ended December 31, 2022, the U.S. dollar was stronger relative to the Canadian and Australian dollars which resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency impact on our operating results.

We define comparable store sales to be sales by stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or, in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. We consider any store temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic to be open and comparable during the period for the purposes of calculating comparable store sales growth. Comparable store sales growth excludes stores acquired in the 2nd Ave. acquisition because those stores were not yet fully integrated during the prior year comparative period. Comparable store sales growth is measured in local currency for Canada, while total comparable store sales growth is measured on a constant currency basis. (2) Comparable store daily sales growth represents net sales by stores in the relevant geography that were or would have been open for the entirety of both periods if not for temporary closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, divided by the aggregate number of days those stores were open. Comparable store daily sales growth is the percentage change in comparable store daily sales over the comparable period in the prior fiscal year. Comparable store daily sales growth excludes stores acquired in the 2nd Ave. Acquisition, because those stores were not yet fully integrated during the prior year comparative period.

Financial Analyst The disclosed financial results of Owlet, Inc. for Q4 and FY 2023 indicate a substantial reduction in net loss and adjusted EBITDA loss year over year. A Financial Analyst would note that the gross margin improvement from 33.7% to 41.8% suggests a more efficient cost structure and potentially increased pricing power. The reduction in operating expenses, down significantly from the previous year, reflects stringent cost control measures and operational efficiency improvements.However, it's important to analyze the decrease in revenue from $69.2 million in FY 2022 to $54.0 million in FY 2023. This could signal a contraction in sales volume or a shift in product mix, which might concern investors regarding the company's growth trajectory. The market reaction will likely depend on future revenue forecasts and the company's ability to maintain margin improvements while reversing the revenue decline. Market Research Analyst A Market Research Analyst would be interested in the impact of Owlet's FDA authorizations on its market position. The entry into healthcare channels and potential insurance reimbursements for the BabySat product could open new revenue streams and bolster market share. The emphasis on commercializing new medical devices suggests a strategic pivot towards higher-margin products that cater to a more regulated and professional healthcare market.Understanding consumer response to Owlet's product innovations and the competitive landscape is crucial. If Owlet's products resonate with consumer needs and preferences while fulfilling stringent safety standards, the company could see a positive shift in consumer sentiment and increased adoption rates, which would be pivotal for long-term growth. Medical Device Industry Expert An expert in the Medical Device Industry would recognize that Owlet's progress in obtaining FDA authorizations is a significant milestone. FDA authorizations can enhance credibility and trust in the company's products, potentially leading to increased sales. It's also a signal of the company's commitment to meeting high regulatory standards, which is essential in the medical device sector.The mention of insurance reimbursement for BabySat is particularly noteworthy. Reimbursement can be a major driver of product adoption in the medical device industry, as it reduces the out-of-pocket cost for consumers and can lead to broader utilization. The ability to secure insurance partnerships and navigate the complex reimbursement landscape is often a critical factor in a medical device company's success. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM LEHI, Utah--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Owlet, Inc.

The Company does not endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by third parties. Disclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to the financial measures presented in this release in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), the Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share. The Company uses such non-GAAP financial measures as internal measures of business operating performance and as performance measures for benchmarking against the Company’s peers and competitors. The Company believes its presentation of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of the Company’s current business and enables investors to better understand and evaluate its historical and prospective operating performance. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they exclude items that vary from period to period without correlation to the Company’s core operating performance and highlight trends in its business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. Due to the nature of the items being excluded, such items do not reflect future gains, losses, expenses or benefits and are not indicative of the Company’s future operating performance. The Company believes investors, analysts and other interested parties use EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share in evaluating issuers, and the presentation of these measures facilitates a comparative assessment of the Company’s operating performance in addition to the Company’s performance based on GAAP results. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or net loss per share as a measure of financial performance or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. EBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted for income tax provision and interest expense, net and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted for income tax provision, interest expense, interest expense from contingent beneficial conversion feature, interest income, depreciation and amortization, restructuring costs, warrant liability adjustments, gain on loan forgiveness, stock-based compensation, and transaction costs. Adjusted net loss is defined as net loss adjusted for restructuring costs, common stock warrant liability adjustments, stock-based compensation, and transaction costs. Adjusted net loss per share is defined as adjusted net loss divided by weighted-average shares of common stock. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share are not recognized terms under GAAP, and the Company’s presentation of these non-GAAP measures does not replace the presentation of the Company’s financial results in accordance with GAAP. Because all companies do not use EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share (and similarly titled financial measures) in the same way, those measures as used by other companies may not be consistent with the way the Company calculates such measures. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this release should not be construed as substitutes for or better indicators of the Company’s performance than the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. See the reconciliation tables that accompany this release for additional information regarding certain of the non-GAAP financial measures included herein.

Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2024 Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary MongoDB, Inc. (MDB) reports strong financial results with Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Total Revenue of $458.0 million, up 27% Year-over-Year, and Full Year Fiscal 2024 Total Revenue of $1.68 billion, up 31% Year-over-Year. MongoDB Atlas revenue increased by 34% year-over-year, representing 68% of total Q4 revenue. The company continues to see robust customer growth with over 47,800 customers as of January 31, 2024. Positive Strong financial performance with significant revenue growth year-over-year Continued customer growth and market penetration Focus on key product development and go-to-market initiatives for long-term growth Healthy cash flow generation and strong cash position Expansion of MongoDB Atlas across major cloud platforms globally Negative None. Financial Analyst MongoDB's reported revenue growth of 27% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 31% for the full fiscal year 2024 is a robust indicator of the company's market performance and expansion capabilities. The significant rise in subscription revenue by 28% and the notable 34% increase in MongoDB Atlas revenue, now constituting 68% of total Q4 revenue, demonstrate a strong customer adoption rate and a successful transition towards a cloud-based service model, which is a prevailing trend in the software industry.From a financial perspective, the consistent gross margin of 75% aligns with industry standards for SaaS companies, ensuring that MongoDB maintains its profitability metrics despite rapid growth. However, the reported net losses, albeit reduced from the previous year, underscore the aggressive investment strategy in product development and market expansion. The positive free cash flow figures, which have improved significantly year-over-year, provide MongoDB with strategic flexibility and the ability to sustain its growth without immediate additional financing.Looking at the provided guidance for fiscal 2025, there is an anticipated revenue increase to between $1.90 billion and $1.93 billion, which suggests confidence in continued growth. However, the impact of over $80 million of FY24 revenue not expected to be realized in FY25 should be noted, as it may affect year-over-year comparisons and investor expectations. Market Research Analyst The substantial growth of MongoDB Atlas is indicative of the broader industry trend towards cloud services and the increasing importance of data management solutions in a digital economy. MongoDB's strategic positioning as a developer data platform and its expansion across multiple cloud providers enhance its appeal to a diverse customer base and meet a variety of compliance and operational requirements. The company's global expansion, with Atlas now available in 117 cloud regions, is a testament to its scalability and commitment to meeting the needs of a global customer base.Furthermore, MongoDB's collaboration with Microsoft to integrate Atlas with Microsoft Fabric and support for large language models (LLMs) positions the company at the forefront of emerging AI technologies, potentially driving future growth as AI and machine learning become more integral to business operations.The recognition as a Leader in the 2023 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Cloud Database Management Systems for the second consecutive year reinforces MongoDB's competitive standing in the market and may contribute to favorable customer perceptions and increased adoption rates. Technology Industry Analyst MongoDB's financial results reflect the company's technological advancements and the increasing adoption of its platform for modern application development. The growth in customer base to over 47,800 and the reliance on MongoDB's flexible and scalable platform for AI-driven applications highlight the company's relevance in the current technology landscape.The operational loss reduction from $346.7 million in the year-ago period to $233.7 million in fiscal 2024, paired with a non-GAAP income from operations increase, suggests that MongoDB is effectively managing its growth while improving operational efficiency. This balance between growth and operational management is critical for technology companies that are scaling rapidly.However, the forward-looking statement regarding the non-realization of over $80 million of FY24 revenue in FY25 requires careful consideration. It suggests that while MongoDB is growing, there are complexities in revenue recognition and potential fluctuations in future earnings that stakeholders should monitor. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Total Revenue of $458.0 million, up 27% Year-over-Year Full Year Fiscal 2024 Total Revenue of $1.68 billion, up 31% Year-over-Year Continued Strong Customer Growth with Over 47,800 Customers as of January 31, 2024 MongoDB Atlas Revenue up 34% Year-over-Year; 68% of Total Q4 Revenue NEW YORK, March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- MongoDB, Inc.

Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 and Recent Business Highlights MongoDB Atlas—the most widely available cloud-based developer data platform in the world—expanded across AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure and is now available in 117 cloud regions globally, including Indonesia, Poland, Bahrain and Chile. With its broad global coverage, Atlas meets the needs of customers with demanding data residency, latency and high availability requirements for their business-critical applications.MongoDB was showcased as a key partner at Microsoft Ignite, highlighting collaboration to further empower developers to securely bring the power of large language models (LLMs) to their proprietary data. MongoDB Atlas is now integrated with Microsoft Fabric to run large-scale AI workloads across the enterprise data estate, and MongoDB Atlas Vector Search now also includes native support for Microsoft Semantic Kernel for working with LLMs.For the second consecutive year, MongoDB was named a Leader in the 2023 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Cloud Database Management Systems.First Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2025 Guidance Based on information available to management as of today, March 7, 2024, MongoDB is issuing the following financial guidance for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2025. This guidance reflects the impact of over $80 million of FY24 revenue, related to multi-year term licenses and unused Atlas commitments, that we do not expect to realize in FY25. First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Full Year Fiscal 2025 Revenue $436.0 million to $440.0 million $1.90 billion to $1.93 billion Non-GAAP Income from Operations $22.0 million to $25.0 million $186.0 million to $201.0 million Non-GAAP Net Income per Share $0.34 to $0.39 $2.27 to $2.49 Reconciliations of non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income per share guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from these non-GAAP measures; in particular, the measures and effects of stock-based compensation expense specific to equity compensation awards that are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in MongoDB's stock price. MongoDB expects the variability of the above charges to have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on its future GAAP financial results. Conference Call Information MongoDB will host a conference call today, March 7, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) to discuss its financial results and business outlook. A live webcast of the call will be available on the ""Investor Relations"" page of MongoDB's website at https://investors.mongodb.com. To access the call by phone, please go to this link (registration link), and you will be provided with dial in details. To avoid delays, we encourage participants to dial into the conference call fifteen minutes ahead of the scheduled start time. A replay of the webcast will also be available for a limited time at http://investors.mongodb.com. Forward-Looking Statements This press release includes certain ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements concerning MongoDB's financial guidance for the first fiscal quarter and full year fiscal 2025, our ability to capitalize on our market opportunity and deliver strong growth for the foreseeable future as well as the criticality of MongoDB to artificial intelligence application development. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements contained in this press release that are not historical facts and statements identified by words such as ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""continue,"" ""could,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""intend,"" ""may,"" ""plan,"" ""project,"" ""will,"" ""would"" or the negative or plural of these words or similar expressions or variations. These forward-looking statements reflect our current views about our plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects, which are based on the information currently available to us and on assumptions we have made. Although we believe that our plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects as reflected in or suggested by those forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that the plans, intentions, expectations or strategies will be attained or achieved. Furthermore, actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements and are subject to a variety of assumptions, uncertainties, risks and factors that are beyond our control including, without limitation: the effects of the ongoing military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas on our business and future operating results; economic downturns and/or the effects of rising interest rates, inflation and volatility in the global economy and financial markets on our business and future operating results; our potential failure to meet publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results; our limited operating history; our history of losses; failure of our platform to satisfy customer demands; the effects of increased competition; our investments in new products and our ability to introduce new features, services or enhancements; social, ethical and security issues relating to the use of new and evolving technologies, such as artificial intelligence, in our offerings or partnerships; our ability to effectively expand our sales and marketing organization; our ability to continue to build and maintain credibility with the developer community; our ability to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers; our ability to maintain, protect, enforce and enhance our intellectual property; the effects of social, ethical and regulatory issues relating to the use of new and evolving technologies, such as artificial intelligence, in our offerings or partnerships; the growth and expansion of the market for database products and our ability to penetrate that market; our ability to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions; our ability to maintain the security of our software and adequately address privacy concerns; our ability to manage our growth effectively and successfully recruit and retain additional highly-qualified personnel; and the price volatility of our common stock. These and other risks and uncertainties are more fully described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""), including under the caption ""Risk Factors"" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on December 7, 2023. Additional information will be made available in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2024 and other filings and reports that we may file from time to time with the SEC. Except as required by law, we undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this release as a result of new information, future events, changes in expectations or otherwise. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release includes the following financial measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share and free cash flow. Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin exclude expenses associated with stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share exclude: expenses associated with stock-based compensation including employer payroll taxes upon the vesting and exercising of stock-based awards and expenses related to stock appreciation rights previously issued to our employees in China;amortization of intangible assets for the acquired technology and acquired customer relationships associated with prior acquisitions; andin the case of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share, amortization of the debt issuance costs associated with our convertible senior notes and gains or losses on non-marketable securities;additionally, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share for the fiscal year 2024 periods are adjusted for an assumed provision for income taxes based on an estimated long-term non-GAAP tax rate. The non-GAAP tax rate was calculated utilizing a three-year financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments and considers other factors such as operating structure and existing tax positions in various jurisdictions. We intend to periodically reevaluate the projected long-term tax rate, as necessary, for significant events and our ongoing analysis of relevant tax law changes.MongoDB uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating MongoDB's ongoing operational performance. MongoDB believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing its financial results with other companies in MongoDB's industry, many of which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Free cash flow represents net cash from/used in operating activities, less capital expenditures, principal repayments of finance lease liabilities and capitalized software development costs, if any. MongoDB uses free cash flow to understand and evaluate its liquidity and to generate future operating plans. The exclusion of capital expenditures, principal repayments of finance lease liabilities and amounts capitalized for software development facilitates comparisons of MongoDB's liquidity on a period-to-period basis and excludes items that it does not consider to be indicative of its liquidity. MongoDB believes that free cash flow is a measure of liquidity that provides useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating the strength of its liquidity and future ability to generate cash that can be used for strategic opportunities or investing in its business in the same manner as MongoDB's management and board of directors. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In particular, other companies may report non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per share, free cash flow or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as presented below. This earnings press release and any future releases containing such non-GAAP reconciliations can also be found on the Investor Relations page of MongoDB's website at https://investors.mongodb.com.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure based on US GAAP, excluding interest income, net, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, litigation costs, and write-off of long-lived assets and others.

We define adjusted earnings per share as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average shares outstanding. We define adjusted gross profit as revenue less cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), and adjusted gross margin as adjusted gross profit as a percentage of revenue. We define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchase of property and equipment and capitalized costs included in intangible assets.

We define adjusted earnings per share as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average shares outstanding. We define adjusted gross profit as revenue less cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), and adjusted gross margin as adjusted gross profit as a percentage of revenue.

The expected federal and state income tax rate was approximately 25.75% for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023. There was no tax effect of such adjustments for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, as a full valuation allowance was provided for the net deferred tax assets.(3)For the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, diluted weighted average shares outstanding for adjusted diluted earnings per share are calculated by the inclusion of unvested RSUs, which were not included in US GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding due to the Company's net loss position for such periods.

We believe they provide useful information to our investors as they eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our cash operations and ongoing operating performance. In addition, we use them as an integral part of our internal reporting to measure the performance and operating strength of our business. We believe adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, and FCF are relevant and provide useful information frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies similar to ours and are indicators of the operational strength of our business. We believe adjusted EBITDA eliminates the uneven effect of considerable amounts of non-cash depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense and the impact of other non-recurring items, providing useful comparisons versus prior periods or forecasts. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. We believe adjusted net income provides additional means of evaluating period-over-period operating performance by eliminating certain non-cash expenses and other items that might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult and obscure trends in ongoing operations. Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income (loss), excluding share-based compensation expense, amortization of share-based compensation capitalized in intangible assets, and discrete tax items, and including the tax effect of adjustments. We define adjusted earnings per share as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average shares outstanding. Our adjusted gross profit is a measure used by management in evaluating the business’s current operating performance by excluding the impact of prior historical costs of assets that are expensed systematically and allocated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which may not be indicative of the current operating activity. Our adjusted gross profit is calculated by using revenue, less cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). We believe adjusted gross profit provides useful information to our investors by eliminating the impact of non-cash depreciation and amortization, and specifically the amortization of software developed for internal use, providing a baseline of our core operating results that allow for analyzing trends in our underlying business consistently over multiple periods. Adjusted gross margin is calculated as adjusted gross profit as a percentage of revenue. We believe FCF is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available, after capital expenditures, for operational expenses and investment in our business. FCF is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate the business’s operating performance and trends over time. FCF is calculated by using net cash provided by operating activities, less purchase of property and equipment and capitalized costs included in intangible assets. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, and FCF are not intended to be performance measures that should be regarded as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, financial measures presented in accordance with US GAAP. In addition, FCF is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. The way we measure adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, and FCF may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and may not be identical to corresponding measures used in our various agreements. SUPPLEMENTAL METRICS The following metrics are intended as a supplement to the financial statements found in this release and other information furnished or filed with the SEC. These supplemental metrics are not necessarily derived from any underlying financial statement amounts. We believe these supplemental metrics help investors understand trends within our business and evaluate the performance of such trends quickly and effectively. In the event of discrepancies between amounts in these tables and the Company's historical disclosures or financial statements, readers should rely on the Company's filings with the SEC and financial statements in the Company's most recent earnings release. We intend to periodically review and refine the definition, methodology and appropriateness of each of these supplemental metrics. As a result, metrics are subject to removal and/or changes, and such changes could be material.

Billable customers are typically corporate organizations. In most cases, corporate organizations will have multiple users and/or departments purchasing our solutions, however, we count the entire organization as a discrete customer.(2)We define a user of FOREWARN as a unique person that has a subscription to use the FOREWARN service as of the last day of the period. A unique person can only have one user account.(3)Contractual revenue % represents revenue generated from customers pursuant to pricing contracts containing a monthly fee and any additional overage divided by total revenue. Pricing contracts are generally annual contracts or longer, with auto renewal.(4)Gross revenue retention is defined as the revenue retained from existing customers, net of reinstated revenue, and excluding expansion revenue. Revenue is measured once a customer has generated revenue for six consecutive months. Revenue is considered lost when all revenue from a customer ceases for three consecutive months; revenue generated by a customer after the three-month loss period is defined as reinstated revenue. Gross revenue retention percentage is calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis. The numerator of which is revenue lost during the period due to attrition, net of reinstated revenue, and the denominator of which is total revenue based on an average of total revenue at the beginning of each month during the period, with the quotient subtracted from one. Prior to Q1’22, FOREWARN revenue was excluded from our gross revenue retention calculation. Beginning Q4’22, our gross revenue retention calculation excludes revenue from idiVERIFIED, which is purely transactional and currently represents less than 3% of total revenue.(5)Revenue from new customers represents the total monthly revenue generated from new customers in a given period. A customer is defined as a new customer during the first six months of revenue generation.(6)Base revenue from existing customers represents the total monthly revenue generated from existing customers in a given period that does not exceed the customers' trailing six-month average revenue. A customer is defined as an existing customer six months after their initial month of revenue.(7)Growth revenue from existing customers represents the total monthly revenue generated from existing customers in a given period in excess of the customers' trailing six-month average revenue.

Cash balance was $13.1 million with a leverage ratio of 1.9x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. The company updated its Fiscal Year 2024 guidance to reflect second quarter results, expecting low-to-mid single-digit net sales growth in the second half. Negative None. Financial Analyst The Duckhorn Portfolio's financial results demonstrate a mixed picture, with a slight decrease in net sales by 0.4% year over year, indicating a challenging environment for growth. However, the company's ability to increase its net income by 6% and adjusted EBITDA by 10.1% is notable. This suggests effective cost management and an improvement in gross profit margins, which have risen by 330 basis points. The focus on profitability, even in the face of flat sales growth, reflects a strategic emphasis on operational efficiency and pricing power.From an investor's perspective, the improved leverage ratio of 1.9x net debt to trailing twelve months adjusted EBITDA is a positive sign, indicating a healthy balance sheet with controlled debt levels. This could potentially lead to a more favorable credit rating and lower cost of capital for the company. The updated fiscal year 2024 guidance, with an implied second half growth rate in the low-to-mid single digits, suggests cautious optimism amidst a 'softer demand environment.' This revision may impact investor expectations and stock performance in the short term. Market Research Analyst Despite a slight sales decline, The Duckhorn Portfolio's statement about continuing to 'take share' in both total and luxury wine markets is significant. This implies that the company is outperforming its competitors, which could be attributed to strong brand equity and consumer loyalty. The reported increase in gross profit margin and adjusted EBITDA margin by 400 basis points indicates that the company is not only maintaining but also possibly increasing its premium pricing, which is a critical factor in the luxury goods market.Understanding the company's sales channels is key. The stability in wholesale distribution, with a minor shift from California direct trade to the broader distributor network, could indicate a strategic realignment or a response to market dynamics. The direct-to-consumer (DTC) channel, while slightly down, remains a significant part of their business model, offering higher margins and customer engagement opportunities. Economist The Duckhorn Portfolio's performance must be contextualized within the broader economic environment. The wine industry is often seen as recession-resistant, but not immune to broader economic headwinds such as changes in disposable income, shifts in consumer spending habits and supply chain disruptions. The company's ability to maintain profitability and grow adjusted EBITDA in such an environment is commendable.Additionally, the luxury segment of the market often behaves differently from the broader market during economic downturns, sometimes maintaining or even increasing sales as affluent consumers continue to spend. The Duckhorn Portfolio's resilience in this sector could be an indicator of strong brand positioning and product differentiation. However, the cautious guidance for the second half of fiscal year 2024 reflects an awareness of potential economic challenges ahead. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM Net Sales of $103.0 million, approximately flat year over year Net Income of $15.9 million, up approximately 6% year over year Adjusted EBITDA of $42.7 million, up approximately 10% year over year Updates Fiscal Year 2024 Guidance ST. HELENA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Duckhorn Portfolio, Inc. (NYSE: NAPA) (the “Company”) today reported its financial results for the three months ended January 31, 2024. Second Quarter 2024 Highlights Net sales were $103.0 million, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 0.4%, versus the prior year period. Gross profit was $58.3 million, an increase of $3.1 million, or 5.7%, versus the prior year period. Gross profit margin was 56.6%, up 330 basis points versus the prior year period. Net income was $15.9 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, versus $14.9 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the prior year period. Adjusted net income was $20.7 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, versus $21.1 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $42.7 million, an increase of $3.9 million, or 10.1%, and adjusted EBITDA margin improved 400 basis points versus the prior year period. Cash was $13.1 million as of January 31, 2024. The Company’s leverage ratio was 1.9x net debt (net of debt issuance costs) to trailing twelve months adjusted EBITDA. Deirdre Mahlan, Interim President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson, commented, “We delivered strong profitability in the second quarter and continued to take share amidst broader industry headwinds. Importantly, we grew adjusted EBITDA by approximately 10% to $42.7 million representing a 41.5% adjusted EBITDA margin, a 400-basis point improvement over the prior year period, driven by robust gross margins and strong operating cost management.” Ms. Mahlan continued, “The Duckhorn Portfolio continues to outpace both total wine and luxury wine markets, as consumers routinely choose our products over the competition.” Jennifer Fall Jung, Chief Financial Officer, said, “We delivered second quarter profitability well above expectations as we managed through a softer demand environment. We are updating our full-year fiscal 2024 guidance to reflect our second quarter results and more caution with regard to the second half. Our new guidance implies a second half growth rate of low-to-mid single digit net sales growth. As a leading luxury wine company, we remain confident in our ability to continue to take share and deliver sustained, profitable, long-term growth.” Second Quarter 2024 Results Three months ended January 31, Six months ended January 31, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net sales (decline) growth (0.4 )% 4.8 % (2.9 )% 4.3 % Volume contribution (2.7 )% (0.4 )% (3.1 )% 4.5 % Price / mix contribution 2.3 % 5.2 % 0.2 % (0.2 )% Three months ended January 31, Six months ended January 31, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Wholesale – Distributors 62.1 % 61.3 % 69.6 % 69.0 % Wholesale – California direct to trade 18.9 19.1 17.2 17.4 DTC 19.0 19.6 13.2 13.6 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Net sales were $103.0 million, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 0.4%, versus $103.5 million in the prior year period. The decline in net sales was driven by lower shipment volumes, largely offset by improvements in price / mix of 2.3% driven by lower trade spend. Gross profit was $58.3 million, an increase of $3.1 million, or 5.7%, versus the prior year period. Gross profit margin was 56.6%, improving 330 basis points versus the prior year period as a result of cost of sales improvement and lower trade spend. Total selling, general and administrative expenses were $29.2 million, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 1.1%, versus $29.6 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily attributed to lower transaction costs related to our pending acquisition of Sonoma-Cutrer Vineyards, Inc., partially offset by higher depreciation expense related to the asset acquisition of the Geyserville winery in Fiscal 2023. Net income was $15.9 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, versus $14.9 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the prior year period. Adjusted net income was $20.7 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, versus $21.1 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the prior year period. The decrease in adjusted net income was primarily driven by a modest decrease in sales and increase in interest expense, mostly offset by favorable gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA was $42.7 million, an increase of $3.9 million, or 10.1%, versus $38.8 million in the prior year period. This increase was driven primarily by an improvement in gross margin and strong operating expense management, partially offset by a slight decrease in net sales. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 400 basis points versus the prior year period.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Adjusted gross profit, adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, collectively referred to as “Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” are commonly used in the Company’s industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net income or earnings per share as indicators of operating performance (as determined in accordance with GAAP). These Non-GAAP Financial Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company has included these Non-GAAP Financial Measures because it believes the measures provide management and investors with additional information to evaluate business performance in comparison to budgets, forecasts and prior year financial results. Non-GAAP Financial Measures are adjusted to exclude certain items that affect comparability. The adjustments are itemized in the tables below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reason the Company considers them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating adjustments, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments set forth below. The presentation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company calculates as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash equity-based compensation expense, purchase accounting adjustments, casualty losses or gains, changes in the fair value of derivatives and certain other items which are not related to our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure the Company uses in evaluating its operational results. The Company believes adjusted EBITDA is a helpful measure to provide investors an understanding of how management regularly monitors the Company’s core operating performance, as well as how management makes operational and strategic decisions in allocating resources. The Company believes adjusted EBITDA also provides management and investors consistency and comparability with the Company’s past financial performance and facilitates period to period comparisons of operations, as it eliminates the effects of certain variations unrelated to its overall performance. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include: although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company’s working capital needs; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on the Company’s debt; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to the Company; and other companies, including companies in the Company’s industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduce their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net income and the Company’s other GAAP results. In evaluating adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The Company’s presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by the types of items excluded from the calculation of adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted Gross Profit Adjusted gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company calculates as gross profit excluding the impact of purchase accounting adjustments (including depreciation and amortization related to purchase accounting), non-cash equity-based compensation expense, and certain inventory charges. We believe adjusted gross profit is a useful measure to us and our investors to assist in evaluating our operating performance because it provides consistency and direct comparability with our past financial performance between fiscal periods, as the metric eliminates the effects of non-cash or other expenses unrelated to our core operating performance that would result in fluctuations in a given metric for reasons unrelated to overall continuing operating performance. Adjusted gross profit should not be considered a substitute for gross profit or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Net Income Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company calculates as net income excluding the impact of non-cash equity-based compensation expense, purchase accounting adjustments, casualty losses or gains, impairment losses (including certain inventory charges), changes in the fair value of derivatives and certain other items unrelated to core operating performance, as well as the estimated income tax impacts of all such adjustments included in this non-GAAP performance measure. We believe adjusted net income assists us and our investors in evaluating our performance period-over-period. In calculating adjusted net income, we also calculate the following non-GAAP financial measures which adjust each GAAP-based financial measure for the relevant portion of each adjustment to reach adjusted net income: Adjusted SG&A – calculated as selling, general, and administrative expenses excluding the impacts of purchase accounting, transaction expenses, equity-based compensation; and Adjusted income tax – calculated as the tax effect of all adjustments to reach adjusted net income based on the applicable blended statutory tax rate for the period. Adjusted net income should not be considered a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EPS Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company calculates as adjusted net income divided by diluted share count for the applicable period. We believe adjusted EPS is useful to us and our investors because it improves the comparability of results of operations from period to period. Adjusted EPS should not be considered a substitute for net income per share or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. THE DUCKHORN PORTFOLIO, INC.

Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results by Domo, Inc. reflect a modest year-over-year growth in total revenue and subscription revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter, with a respective 1% and 2% increase. However, the company's billings have shown a slight decline of 1% for the full fiscal year, which could indicate a potential slowdown in future revenue growth, as billings often serve as a leading indicator. The improvement in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins suggests that Domo has been effective in controlling costs or improving operational efficiency. However, the persistence of GAAP and non-GAAP net losses, despite these improvements, raises questions about the company's path to profitability.Investors will likely focus on the cash position, which remains relatively stable and the operating cash flow, which is positive, indicating some level of operational health. Yet, the guidance for the upcoming fiscal year suggests that the company expects continued net losses. The lack of reconciliation for non-GAAP metrics could be a concern for transparency and may require stakeholders to scrutinize the adjustments made. Overall, these results should be weighed against industry benchmarks and competitors' performance to fully assess Domo's financial health and growth prospects. Market Research Analyst Domo's emphasis on strategic investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and data to enhance their full suite of solutions is indicative of the company's commitment to innovation and staying relevant in a competitive market. The recognition received from various research and advisory firms, such as Ventana Research and Dresner Advisory Services, underscores Domo's position as a leader in analytics and business intelligence platforms. This could strengthen the company's market position and brand perception, potentially leading to increased customer acquisition and retention.However, the market's reaction to these results and outlook will depend on how these innovations translate into financial performance. The company's guidance suggests modest revenue growth and continued net losses, which may not align with investor expectations for a high-growth tech company. It is important to consider the broader market trends, such as the increasing demand for AI-driven analytics and how Domo's product offerings and strategic focus are positioned to capitalize on these opportunities. Technology Industry Analyst Domo's focus on expanding its AI capabilities and data solutions is a strategic move that aligns with current technology trends. The integration of AI into analytics platforms is becoming a standard in the industry and Domo's Domo.AI solution being named a finalist in the 2023 Cloud Awards signals the company's potential to innovate in this space. The recognition for collaborative, augmented, embedded and mobile analytics also demonstrates Domo's comprehensive approach to meeting diverse customer needs.The technology sector, particularly in AI and data analytics, is highly competitive and Domo's investments in these areas are crucial for maintaining a competitive edge. However, the ability to monetize these investments and convert them into sustainable revenue streams will be critical for Domo's long-term success. The company's business outlook and expected continued net losses suggest that while Domo is investing in growth areas, it may take time for these investments to reflect in the bottom line. Stakeholders should consider the potential of Domo's technology advancements against the backdrop of the company's financial sustainability. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM SILICON SLOPES, Utah--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Domo, Inc.

Domo Disclosure Channels to Disseminate Information Domo investors and others should note that we announce material information to the public about our company, products and services, and other issues through a variety of means, including Domo’s website, press releases, filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), blogs and social media, in order to achieve broad, non-exclusionary distribution of information to the public. We intend to use the Domo Facebook page, the Domo LinkedIn page, the Domo blog, the @Domotalk X account and the @JoshJames X account as a means of disclosing information about the Company and its services and for complying with the disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. The information we post through these social media channels may be deemed material. Accordingly, we encourage investors and others to monitor these social media channels in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts. The social media channels that we intend to use as a means of disclosing the information described here may be updated from time to time as listed on our investor relations webpage. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP), we reference in this press release and the accompanying tables the following non-GAAP financial measures: billings, non-GAAP subscription gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share, and adjusted free cash flow. In computing these measures, we exclude the effects of certain items including stock-based compensation expense, amortization of certain intangible assets, severance of executive officers who report to the Chief Executive Officer, and proceeds from shares issued in connection with the employee stock purchase plan. As it relates to adjusted free cash flow, we add back amounts equal to the proceeds from shares issued in connection with employee stock purchase plan to reflect the non-cash nature of these transactions. Because no cash is exchanged in these transactions, showing proceeds in the financing section of the statement of cash flows as required by GAAP results in a corresponding decrease in the operating section, which management believes is not indicative of actual cash used in or provided by our operations. We believe that this non-GAAP cash metric is useful because it provides investors with the same information that management uses to consistently evaluate, forecast and measure the Company’s actual cash flows and its ability to achieve and maintain positive cash flows. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of our ongoing core business operating results. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when analyzing historical performance and liquidity and planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. During fiscal year 2024, we revised our definition for non-GAAP statement of operations line items to adjust for executive severance expenses. We have revised the prior period amounts to conform to our current period presentation.

Financial Analyst The financial results reported by El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. highlight a mixed performance with a slight increase in system-wide comparable restaurant sales but a decrease in total revenue and net income. The trend of divesting company-operated restaurants to franchisees is noteworthy, as it impacts the company's revenue composition and potentially its risk profile. The increase in franchise revenue suggests a strategic shift that may alleviate operational risks and capital expenditures associated with company-operated venues. However, the drop in net income could raise concerns about profitability and operational efficiency.From an investment standpoint, the share repurchase program and the specific transaction with FS Equity Partners V, L.P. and FS Affiliates V, L.P. indicate a management belief in the undervaluation of the company's stock, which could be perceived positively by the market. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of such a program in enhancing shareholder value would depend on the future performance of the company and the broader market conditions. The capital spending outlook and G&A expenses forecast for 2024 will be critical figures for investors to monitor, as they reflect the company's growth strategy and operational cost management. Market Research Analyst El Pollo Loco's emphasis on menu innovation and marketing initiatives as part of their strategy for growth and profitability improvements is a response to the competitive fast-casual dining sector. The slight increase in system-wide comparable restaurant sales indicates resilience in consumer demand for their offerings, despite economic pressures that might affect discretionary spending. The company's focus on 'four-wall operational excellence' suggests an internal analysis of store-level profitability and operations, a key factor for sustaining growth in a market where consumer preferences are rapidly evolving.Additionally, the company's pivot towards franchising could be a strategic move to expand its market penetration with a lower capital investment, leveraging the capital and local expertise of franchisees. This is a common trend in the industry, where franchising is often used to achieve scalability and brand presence. The impact of this strategy on long-term revenue and brand consistency will be areas of interest for market observers. Legal Expert The share repurchase transaction with FS Equity Partners V, L.P. and FS Affiliates V, L.P. requires scrutiny under securities regulations to ensure compliance with insider trading and market manipulation rules. The timing and price of the repurchase, set at the closing price on the Nasdaq, appear to follow standard procedures for such transactions. However, it is important to consider the broader legal context, including disclosure obligations and potential effects on market price and investor perception. The company's adherence to a transparent and fair process in this repurchase is crucial for maintaining investor trust and avoiding legal complications. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM COSTA MESA, Calif., March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: LOCO) today announced financial results for the 13-week period ended December 27, 2023. Highlights for the fourth quarter ended December 27, 2023 compared to the fourth quarter ended December 28, 2022 were as follows: Total revenue was $112.2 million compared to $115.9 million.System-wide comparable restaurant sales(1) increased 0.9%.Income from operations was $7.5 million compared to $9.5 million.Restaurant contribution(1) was $14.8 million, or 15.8% of company-operated restaurant revenue, compared to $14.7 million, or 14.7% of company-operated restaurant revenue.Net income was $4.4 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to net income of $6.5 million, or $0.18 per diluted share.Adjusted net income(1) was $5.2 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to $6.0 million, or $0.16 per diluted share.Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $13.6 million, compared to $13.3 million. (1) System-wide comparable restaurant sales, restaurant contribution, adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA are not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and are defined below under “Key Financial Definitions.” A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in the accompanying financial data. See also “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Maria Hollandsworth, President and Chief Operating Officer of El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc., stated, “We are pleased with the progress our team has made during the fourth quarter as they execute against our initiatives geared toward top-line growth and profitability improvements. As we look into 2024, we aim to lean into what makes El Pollo Loco unique – our one-of-a-kind, better-for-you marinated flame grilled chicken that delivers a truly special flavor that our customers crave. Through menu innovations, marketing initiatives and renewed focus on four-wall operational excellence, we will build upon the foundation we have laid down last year to unlock the immense potential we have ahead of us.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Company-operated restaurant revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased to $94.0 million, compared to $99.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, mainly due to a $5.8 million decrease in revenue primarily from the 18 company-operated restaurants sold by the Company to existing franchisees and the decrease in company-operated comparable restaurant revenue of $0.2 million, or 0.2%. This company-operated restaurant revenue decrease was partially offset by $0.5 million increase due to additional sales from restaurants opened during the prior quarters. Franchise revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased 17.0% to $11.0 million. This increase was primarily due to revenue generated from 18 company-operated restaurants sold by the Company to existing franchisees and the opening of five restaurants, in each case, during or subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2022. In addition, this increase was due to a franchise comparable restaurant sales increase of 1.6%. Income from operations in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $7.5 million, compared to $9.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Restaurant contribution was $14.8 million, or 15.8% of company-operated restaurant revenue, compared to $14.7 million, or 14.7% of company-operated restaurant revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in restaurant contribution as a percentage of company-operated restaurant revenue was largely due to higher menu prices combined with better operating efficiencies. General and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $10.6 million, compared to $9.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was due primarily to a $0.6 million increase in executive transition costs and a $0.4 million increase in other general and administrative expenses. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $4.4 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to net income of $6.5 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted net income was $5.2 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, during the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $6.0 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, during the fourth quarter of 2022. On October 31, 2023, the Company approved a share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $20.0 million of shares of the Company’s common stock. The repurchase program will terminate on March 31, 2025, may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time, and does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular number of shares. On November 29, 2023, the Company entered into a Stock Repurchase Agreement with FS Equity Partners V, L.P. and FS Affiliates V, L.P. (together, the “Sellers”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock from the Sellers at a price of $8.40 per share, representing the closing price of such shares as listed on Nasdaq on November 29, 2023, for a total purchase price of $12,600,000 (the “repurchase”). The shares were repurchased pursuant to the Company’s share repurchase program. The repurchase was completed on December 4, 2023. Following completion of this repurchase, approximately $7.4 million of our common stock remained available for repurchase under the share repurchase program at December 27, 2023. As of December 27, 2023, after net borrowings of $4.0 million on its five-year senior-secured revolving credit facility during the fourth quarter, the Company’s outstanding debt balance was $84.0 million with $7.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. Subsequent Events Subsequent to the quarter-end, on February 13, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors has appointed Elizabeth Williams as the new Chief Executive Officer of the Company and as a member of the Board, effective March 11, 2024. Ms. Williams will succeed Maria Hollandsworth, who has served as the Company’s interim Chief Executive Officer since November 3, 2023. Ms. Hollandsworth has been appointed as President of the Company and will also continue to serve as the Company’s Chief Operating Officer. Further, the Company paid down $3.0 million on its 2022 Revolver and outstanding borrowings as of March 7, 2024 were $81.0 million. 2024 Outlook The Company is providing the following expectations for the remainder of 2024: The opening of two new company-owned restaurants and five to seven new franchised restaurants.Capital spend of $25.0 - $28.0 million.G&A expense between $45.0 and $47.0 million.Adjusted income tax rate of 27.0 – 28.0%. Definitions of Non-GAAP and other Key Financial Measures System-wide sales are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. System-wide sales are the sum of company-operated restaurant revenue and sales from franchised restaurants. The Company’s total revenue in the consolidated statements of income is limited to company-operated restaurant revenue and franchise revenue from the Company’s franchisees. Accordingly, system-wide sales should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results as reported under GAAP. Management believes that the presentation of system-wide sales provides useful information to investors because it is a measure that is widely used in the restaurant industry, including by our management, to evaluate brand scale and market penetration. Company-operated restaurant revenue consists of sales of food and beverages in company-operated restaurants net of promotional allowances, employee meals, and other discounts. Company-operated restaurant revenue in any period is directly influenced by the number of operating weeks in such period, the number of open restaurants, and comparable restaurant sales. Seasonal factors and the timing of holidays cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our revenue per restaurant is typically lower in the first and fourth quarters due to reduced January and December transactions and higher in the second and third quarters. As a result of seasonality, our quarterly and annual results of operations and key performance indicators such as company-operated restaurant revenue and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate. Comparable restaurant sales reflect year-over-year sales changes for comparable company-operated, franchised and system-wide restaurants. A restaurant enters our comparable restaurant base the first full week after it has operated for 15 months. Comparable restaurant sales exclude restaurants closed during the applicable period. At December 27, 2023, there were 470 comparable restaurants, 178 company-operated and 292 franchised. Comparable restaurant sales indicate the performance of existing restaurants, since new restaurants are excluded. Comparable restaurant sales growth can be generated by an increase in the number of meals sold and/or by increases in the average check size, resulting from a shift in menu mix and/or higher prices resulting from new products or price increases. Because other companies may calculate this measure differently than we do, comparable restaurant sales as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that comparable restaurant sales is a valuable metric for investors to evaluate the performance of our store base, excluding the impact of new stores and closed stores. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Restaurant contribution is defined as company-operated restaurant revenue less company restaurant expenses, which includes food and paper cost, labor and related expenses, and occupancy and other operating expenses, where applicable. Restaurant contribution therefore excludes franchise revenue, franchise advertising fee revenue and franchise expenses as well as certain other costs, such as general and administrative expenses, franchise expenses, depreciation and amortization, impairment and closed-store reserve, loss on disposal of assets and other costs that are considered corporate-level expenses and are not considered normal operating costs of our restaurants. Accordingly, restaurant contribution is not indicative of overall Company results and does not accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders because of the exclusion of certain corporate-level expenses. Restaurant contribution margin is defined as restaurant contribution as a percentage of net company-operated restaurant revenue. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are supplemental measures of operating performance of our restaurants, and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to those reported by other companies. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Management uses restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin as key metrics to evaluate the profitability of incremental sales at our restaurants, to evaluate our restaurant performance across periods, and to evaluate our restaurant financial performance compared with our competitors. Management believes that restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are important tools for investors, because they are widely-used metrics within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-level productivity, efficiency, and performance. Management further believes restaurant level operating margin is useful to investors to highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent to investors when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and items that we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance, as identified in the reconciliation table included under “Unaudited Reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA” in the accompanying financial tables at the end of this release. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as presented in this release are supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. In addition, in evaluating EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are (i) they do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, (ii) they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs, (iii) they do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt, (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements, (v) they do not adjust for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows, (vi) they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our on-going operations, and (vii) other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from such non-GAAP financial measures. We further compensate for the limitations in our use of non-GAAP financial measures by presenting comparable GAAP measures more prominently. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or NOLs) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We also present EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because (i) management believes that these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, (ii) management believes that investors will find these measures useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness, and (iii) we use EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA internally as benchmark to compare our performance to that of our competitors. Adjusted net income is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted net income represents net income adjusted for (i) costs (or gains) related to loss (or gains) on disposal of assets or assets held for sale and asset impairment and closed store costs reserves, (ii) amortization expense and other estimate adjustments (whether expense or income) incurred on the Tax Receivable Agreement (“TRA”) completed at the time of our IPO, (iii) legal costs associated with securities class action litigation, (iv) extraordinary legal settlement costs, (v) insurance proceeds received related to securities class action legal expenses and (vi) provision for income taxes at a normalized tax rate of 28.4% and 27.2% for the thirteen and fifty-two weeks ended December 27, 2023, respectively, and 26.5% for both the thirteen and fifty-two weeks ended December 28, 2022, which reflects our estimated long-term effective tax rate, including both federal and state income taxes (excluding the impact of the income tax receivable agreement, valuation allowance and other discrete items) and applied after giving effect to the foregoing adjustments. Because other companies may calculate these measures differently than we do, adjusted net income as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes adjusted net income is an important supplement to GAAP measures that enhances the overall understanding of our operating performance and long-term profitability, and enables investors to more effectively compare the Company’s performance to prior and future periods.

All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this press release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements discuss our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements because they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “potential,” “project,” “projection,” “plan,” “intend,” “seek,” “may,” “could,” “would,” “will,” “should,” “can,” “can have,” “likely,” the negatives thereof and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events. They appear in a number of places throughout this press release and include our 2024 outlook and statements regarding the expected results of our initiatives and our ability to capture opportunities and attract franchisees, as well as our ongoing business intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, sales levels, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the industry in which we operate. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we expected. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this press release in the context of the risks and uncertainties that could cause outcomes to differ materially from our expectations. These factors include, but are not limited to: our ability to open new restaurants or establish new markets; our ability to compete successfully, including with other quick-service and fast casual restaurants; our vulnerability to changes in political and economic conditions and consumer preferences; our ability to attract, develop, assimilate, and retain employees; our vulnerability to adverse changes in regions where we are geographically concentrated; our ability to execute our business continuity and response plan following a major disaster such as a natural disaster, terrorism, social unrest or a cybersecurity incident affecting our corporate facilities; our ability to effectively identify and secure appropriate sites for new restaurants; the possibility that we may continue to incur significant impairment of certain of our assets, in particular in our new markets; changes in food and supply costs, especially for chicken, labor, construction and utilities; the impacts of public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic; negative publicity, whether or not valid, including information posted on social media platforms; our ability to continue to expand our digital business, delivery orders and catering; and other risks set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including under Item 1A, Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 28, 2022, as such risk factors may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which are or will be available online at www.sec.gov. We caution you that the important factors referenced above may not contain all of the factors that are important to you. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results or developments we expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the consequences we anticipate or affect us or our operations in the ways that we expect. The forward-looking statements included in this press release are made only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be made that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures that are supplemental measures of the operating performance of our business and restaurants: System-wide sales, Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income. Our calculations of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to those reported by other companies. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as substitutes for, or superior to, financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and to evaluate our restaurants’ financial performance against our competitors’ performance. We believe these measures they provide useful information about our operating results, enhance understanding of past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. These non-GAAP financial measures may also assist investors in evaluating our business and performance relative to industry peers and provide greater transparency with respect to the Company’s financial condition and results of operation. Additional information about these non-GAAP financial measures (System-wide sales, Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income) is provided under “Definitions of Non-GAAP and other Key Financial Measures” above. For a reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, see “Unaudited Reconciliation of System-Wide Sales to Company-Operated Restaurant Revenue and Total Revenue,” “Unaudited Reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA,” “Unaudited Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income” and “Unaudited Reconciliation of Income from Operations to Restaurant Contribution” in the accompanying financial tables at the end of this press release.

We recognized gains of $0.2 million, related to the reimbursement of property and equipment and expenses incurred and $0.3 million related to the reimbursement of lost profits. The gain on recovery of insurance proceeds and reimbursement of lost profits, net of the related costs is included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, for fiscal 2023, as a reduction of company restaurant expenses.

The common dividend will be paid on April 9, 2024, and the Series A Preferred dividend on April 30, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of dividends by Global Medical REIT Inc. is a pivotal event for shareholders, as it directly affects their investment returns. The common dividend of $0.21 per share represents the company's ability to generate cash flow and return value to its shareholders. Investors typically view regular and consistent dividend payments as a sign of a company's financial health and stability.From a financial analysis perspective, the dividend yield, calculated by annualizing the quarterly dividend and dividing it by the stock's current price, is an important metric for income-focused investors. This yield is compared against industry averages and fixed income alternatives to assess the attractiveness of the REIT's stock as an investment. Moreover, the payout ratio, the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends, is crucial to evaluate sustainability. A payout ratio that is too high might indicate potential difficulties in maintaining dividend levels in the future.It is also important to consider the REIT's funds from operations (FFO), a key metric for REITs that measures operating performance. An increasing FFO can support consistent or growing dividends, whereas a declining FFO could signal potential challenges. Real Estate Investment Trust Expert As a specialized form of real estate investment, REITs like Global Medical REIT Inc. offer investors exposure to real estate assets without the need to directly own property. The healthcare sector, in particular, is seen as a defensive investment due to its essential nature and resistance to economic downturns. This could make GMRE's dividends particularly appealing during times of market volatility.The net-lease structure, where tenants pay most of the property expenses, often results in stable cash flows for the REIT. This stability is a critical factor in the REIT's ability to distribute dividends. Investors also look at the quality of the tenants and the length of the leases to gauge the reliability of these cash flows. Physician groups and national healthcare systems typically provide a strong tenant base due to their creditworthiness.It's also significant to note that preferred dividends, such as those declared on GMRE's Series A Preferred Stock, offer holders priority over common stock dividends. This can make preferred shares a more secure income source, albeit often with less upside potential compared to common shares. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM BETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Global Medical REIT Inc. (NYSE: GMRE) (the “Company” or “GMRE”), a net-lease medical office real estate investment trust (REIT) that acquires healthcare facilities and leases those facilities to physician groups and regional and national healthcare systems, announced today that its Board of Directors (“Board”) has declared the Company’s 2024 first quarter common and preferred dividends.

President and CEO Bob Wright expressed pride in the team's achievements and highlighted the success of the Five-Pillar Strategy. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported same-store sales growth of 6.3% and AWS increase of 3.4% to $24,960 for Potbelly Corporation indicate a robust performance in the restaurant industry, particularly for a company specializing in neighborhood sandwich shops. The consistent positive same-store sales growth for eleven consecutive quarters suggests a strong brand loyalty and effective operational strategies, likely contributing to a positive sentiment among investors. The traffic growth as a major driver of sales underscores the success of Potbelly's marketing and customer engagement efforts.Regarding the Franchise Growth Acceleration Initiative, the 202 new shop commitments reflect an aggressive expansion strategy. This can be seen as a move to increase market penetration and operational scale, which in the long run could lead to greater economies of scale and potentially higher margins. However, investors should consider the risks associated with rapid expansion, such as potential over-saturation and increased competition.The provided outlook for the first quarter and full year of 2024, with same-store sales expected to range from a slight decrease to a modest increase, may temper investor expectations. The guidance indicates a cautious optimism, reflecting a realistic approach in an industry subject to fluctuations in consumer spending habits and economic conditions. The focus on long-term sustainable growth aligns with prudent business strategy, which may be more appealing to long-term investors than those looking for short-term gains. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the increased total revenues and improved profitability, with a 370-basis point improvement to shop margin achieving 14.2% for the year, are strong indicators of Potbelly's financial health. The adjusted EBITDA increase of 80.0% to $28.3 million compared to the previous year demonstrates effective cost management and operational efficiency. These figures could potentially lead to a positive reevaluation of the company's stock, as earnings growth is a key driver of stock prices.The reported GAAP net income remaining stable at $2.7 million, despite the revenue increases, may raise questions regarding the translation of top-line growth to bottom-line results. This stability, matched with an unchanged GAAP diluted EPS, suggests that while the company is growing, it may also be facing increased expenses that could be diluting the impact of its revenue growth on net income.Investors should note the non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS provided by the company. While these figures can offer a clearer view of the company's operational performance by excluding one-time items and other non-recurring events, reliance solely on non-GAAP measures can obscure the full financial picture. It is essential to consider both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when evaluating the company's performance. Economist The food service industry is highly susceptible to macroeconomic factors such as disposable income levels, employment rates and consumer confidence. Potbelly's performance, particularly the traffic growth, suggests resilience in the face of any recent economic headwinds. The company's ability to increase sales in such an environment could indicate a strong value proposition and competitive positioning within the industry.However, the cautious guidance for the upcoming year, with same-store sales projected to be in the low- to mid-single digits, may reflect broader economic concerns such as inflationary pressures and potential decreases in consumer discretionary spending. The company's focus on long-term growth and its ability to adapt to economic changes will be critical for maintaining its competitive edge and ensuring shareholder value.It is also worth noting the impact of the 53rd week in the fiscal year 2023, which does not recur in 2024. This anomaly can affect year-over-year comparisons and may need to be factored into the analysis of the company's growth trajectory. Additionally, the refranchising of 33 locations could alter the revenue structure and margin profile, shifting more towards a franchise fee-based model with potentially lower capital expenditure requirements. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM Fourth quarter same-store sales growth of 6.3% and AWS of $24,960, with traffic growth as a major driver 202 new shop commitments to-date under the Franchise Growth Acceleration Initiative Provides first quarter and full year 2024 outlook; Introduces new long-term growth ranges CHICAGO, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Potbelly Corporation (NASDAQ: PBPB), (“Potbelly” or the “Company”) the iconic neighborhood sandwich shop concept, today reported financial results for its 14-week fourth fiscal quarter and 53-week full year ended December 31, 2023.

We made significant progress with our Franchise Growth Acceleration Initiative and ended 2023 with 612 open and committed shops. We’re excited to have delivered another quarter and full year performance in support of our long-term sustainable growth.” Financial Outlook 1Q’24 Guidance2024 GuidanceLong-Term Growth RangesSame Store Sales(0.25%) to +0.5%Low- to Mid-Single DigitLow- to Mid-Single DigitNew Unit Growth--~10%Low-Double DigitAdjusted EBITDA (2)$4.4M to $5.2MHigh-Single to Low-Double DigitLow- to Mid-Double Digit (2)Quarterly and full-year guidance set forth above reflect the impact of refranchising 33 former company locations in 2023; the 53rd week in 2023, which will not recur in 2024; increased costs associated with the Company’s investment in development efforts to support sustained franchise growth and a $1.1 million settlement gain in the first quarter 2024 with a third-party software provider.

Definitions The following definitions apply to these terms as used throughout this press release: Revenues – represents net company-operated sandwich shop sales and our franchise royalties and fees. Net company-operated shop sales consist of food and beverage sales, net of promotional allowances and employee meals. Franchise royalties and fees consist of royalty income, franchise fee, and other fees collected from franchisees including advertising and rent.Company-operated comparable store sales or same-store traffic – an operating measure that represents the change in year-over-year sales or transactions for the comparable company-operated store base open for 15 months or longer. In fiscal years that include a 53rd week, the last week of the fourth quarter and fiscal year is excluded from the year-over-year comparisons so that the time periods are consistent.Average Weekly Sales (AWS) – an operating measure that represents the average weekly sales of all company-operated shops which reported sales during the associated time period.Average Unit Volume (AUV) – an operating measure that represents the average annual sales of all company-operated shops which reported sales during the associated time period.System-wide sales – an operating measure that represents the sum of sales generated by company-operated shops and sales generated by franchised shops, net of all promotional allowances, discounts, and employee meals. Net sales from franchised shops are not included in total revenues. Rather, revenues are limited to the royalties, fees and other income collected from franchisees.EBITDA – a non-GAAP measure that represents income before depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense and the provision for income taxes.Adjusted EBITDA – a non-GAAP measure that represents income before depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense and the provision for income taxes, adjusted to eliminate the impact of other items, including certain non-cash and other items that we do not consider reflective of underlying business performance.Shop-level profit (loss) – a non-GAAP measure that represents income (loss) from operations excluding franchise royalties and fees, franchise support, marketing and rent expenses, general and administrative expenses, depreciation expense, pre-opening costs, restructuring costs, loss on Franchise Growth Acceleration Initiative activities and impairment, loss on the disposal of property and equipment and shop closures.Shop-level profit (loss) margin – a non-GAAP measure that represents shop-level profit expressed as a percentage of net company-operated sandwich shop sales.Adjusted net income (loss) – a non-GAAP measure that represents net income (loss), adjusted to eliminate the impact of restructuring costs, impairment, loss on the disposal of property and equipment, shop closures, and other items we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance, including the income tax effects of those adjustments and the change in our income tax valuation allowance.Adjusted diluted EPS – a non-GAAP measure that represents adjusted net income (loss) divided by the weighted average number of fully dilutive common shares outstanding.Shop commitments – an operating measure that represents the number of company and franchise shops that are committed to be developed. For franchise shops, a shop development area agreement (SDAA) or standalone franchise agreement represents a commitment. For company shops, a commitment is made through a good faith combination of business decision-making and capital allocation needed to develop and operate a new shop location. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We prepare our financial statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). Within this press release, we make reference to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted net income, shop-level profit, and shop-level profit margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company includes these non-GAAP financial measures because management believes they are useful to investors in that they provide for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. Management uses adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS to evaluate the Company’s performance and in order to have comparable financial results to analyze changes in our underlying business from quarter to quarter. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS exclude the impact of certain non-cash charges and other items that affect the comparability of results in past quarters and which we do not believe are reflective of underlying business performance. Management uses shop-level profit and shop-level profit margin as key metrics to evaluate the profitability of incremental sales at our shops, to evaluate our shop performance across periods and to evaluate our shop financial performance against our competitors. Accordingly, the Company believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, is a useful financial analysis tool that can assist investors in assessing the Company’s operating performance and underlying prospects. This analysis should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. This analysis, as well as the other information in this press release, should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and footnotes contained in the documents that the Company files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company in this press release may be different from the methods used by other companies. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the table, “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Financial Measures.” Forward-Looking Statements In addition to historical information, this press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(VIRX) completes Stage 2 enrollment in NAVAL-1 trial of Nana-val for EBV+ lymphoma, expects topline results in Q2 2024. Strengthened balance sheet with $5.0 million non-dilutive proceeds, extending cash runway. Clinical trial updates, business developments, and financial results detailed. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The enrollment completion of both Stage 1 and Stage 2 for the NAVAL-1 trial of Nana-val in relapsed or refractory EBV+ peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is a significant step towards addressing a critical unmet medical need. The 'kick and kill' mechanism of action of Nana-val, which combines nanatinostat with valganciclovir, is designed to activate and then eradicate virus-infected cancer cells. The anticipation of topline results and engagement with the FDA for an accelerated approval pathway could potentially lead to a faster introduction of this treatment to the market, benefiting patients with limited options.Furthermore, the amendment of the protocol to include second-line R/R EBV+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) patients expands the potential impact of the trial. The inclusion of pediatric patients aged 12 and above also highlights a commitment to addressing pediatric oncology needs, which are often underserved in clinical research. Financial Analyst Viracta Therapeutics' strategic financial moves, including the receipt of $5.0 million in non-dilutive proceeds and the execution of amended agreements with Day One Biopharmaceuticals and XOMA, demonstrate a proactive approach to capital management. The partial prepayment of the term loan and the deferral of principal amortization are likely to improve the company's financial flexibility. By reducing the debt balance by over 25% and extending the cash runway into mid-Q1 2025, Viracta is positioning itself to continue its clinical programs without the immediate need for dilutive financing. This financial prudence is essential for maintaining shareholder value and ensuring the sustainability of the company's operations. Market Research Analyst The orphan drug designation (ODD) granted by the FDA for Nana-val in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) could potentially provide Viracta with several benefits, including tax credits, grant funding and market exclusivity upon approval. This designation, coupled with the positive data presented at ESMO Asia Congress 2023, may enhance the marketability of Nana-val in a niche but significant market segment. The determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose and the initiation of a dose-optimization cohort by the end of 2024 are crucial steps that will provide clarity on the drug's safety and efficacy profile, which is essential for market adoption and penetration. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM Completed Stage 2 enrollment in the NAVAL-1 trial of Nana-val in patients with relapsed or refractory EBV+ peripheral T-cell lymphoma supporting its speed to market strategy; topline results from Stage 1 of the study expected in the second quarter of 2024 Completed enrollment into first split daily dosing cohort of the Phase 1b/2 study of Nana-val in patients with advanced EBV+ solid tumors Strengthened balance sheet following receipt of non-dilutive proceeds of $5.0 million through monetization of a pre-commercialization, event-based milestone from Day One Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., extending cash runway into mid-Q1 2025 SAN DIEGO, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Viracta Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: VIRX), a clinical-stage precision oncology company focused on the treatment and prevention of virus-associated cancers that impact patients worldwide, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2023 and provided a business update. “Nana-val is a first-in-class, all-oral combination treatment regimen that has entered late-stage development to target and treat EBV-associated cancers. Our near-term goal is to address the high unmet medical need of patients living with relapsed or refractory EBV-positive PTCL by advancing Nana-val in this lead indication through regulatory approval as quickly as possible,” said Mark Rothera, President and Chief Executive Officer of Viracta. “We are pleased to have successfully completed patient enrollment across both Stage 1 and Stage 2 of the PTCL cohort in our pivotal NAVAL-1 trial. Building on this momentum, we anticipate reporting topline data from Stage 1 in the second quarter of 2024 and engaging with the FDA on a potential accelerated approval pathway in mid-2024.” Clinical Trial Updates and Anticipated Milestones Pivotal NAVAL-1 trial of Nana-val (nanatinostat in combination with valganciclovir) in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) lymphoma Clinical Trial Updates: Completed enrollment of Stage 1 in the R/R EBV+ PTCL cohort (in patients treated with nanatinostat with [n=10] or without [n=10] valganciclovir) in the fourth quarter of 2023.Completed enrollment of Stage 2 in the R/R EBV+ PTCL cohort of patients treated with Nana-val (n=21, Stage 1 + Stage 2 patients) in the first quarter of 2024.Amended protocol to additionally enable enrollment of second-line R/R EBV+ DLBCL patients and R/R EBV+ PTLD patients, including pediatric EBV+ PTLD patients ≥ 12 years of age. Anticipated 2024 Milestones: Present topline Stage 1 data from both arms of the R/R EBV+ PTCL cohort (in patients treated with nanatinostat with [n=10] or without [n=10] valganciclovir) in the second quarter of 2024, with an aim to clearly delineate the differentiation of Nana-val’s ‘kick and kill’ mechanism of action.Engage with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in mid-2024, to align on requirements for accelerated approval.Enroll patients into the post-Phase 2 expansion cohort to support potential accelerated approval.Present Stage 1 + Stage 2 data (n=21) in the R/R EBV+ PTCL cohort in patients treated with Nana-val in the third quarter of 2024.Report Stage 1 data from patients with R/R EBV+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and R/R EBV+ post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) by year-end 2024. Phase 1b/2 trial of Nana-val in patients with recurrent/metastatic (R/M) EBV+ nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and other advanced EBV+ solid tumors (Study 301) Clinical Trial Updates: In December 2023, the FDA granted an orphan drug designation (ODD) to Nana-val for the treatment of NPC, the fifth ODD granted to Nana-val by the FDA, the seventh ODD for Nana-val globally, and the first ODD granted to Nana-val in EBV+ solid tumors.Presented data at ESMO Asia Congress 2023 that confirmed partial responses without dose-limiting toxicities through the initial five dose cohorts, supporting continued dose escalation to potentially enhance Nana-val’s antitumor activity.Completed enrollment of the sixth dose cohort of patients with R/M EBV+ NPC, evaluating the novel split daily dosing (SDD) regimen. Anticipated 2024 Milestones: Determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in the second half of 2024.Initiate a dose-optimization cohort to confirm the RP2D as part of the study’s Phase 2 expansion by year-end 2024. Business Updates Executed an amended license agreement with Day One Biopharmaceuticals In March 2024, to receive non-dilutive proceeds of $5.0 million related to monetization of a pre-commercialization, event-based milestone from Day One Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. Executed an amended Royalty Purchase Agreement with XOMA Amended the Royalty Purchase Agreement with XOMA, modifying the economic value-share under the Royalty Purchase Agreement by which the Company has retained the right, under certain circumstances, to participate in a pre-commercialization event-based milestone up to $5.0 million. Executed the second amendment under the SVB-Oxford Loan Facility Amended the SVB-Oxford Loan Facility, providing for a modification of the loan amortization period and a pro-rata reduction in the prospective debt amortization schedule, in exchange for a partial prepayment of the term loan. Pursuant to the terms of the second amendment, the Company has agreed to remit a prepayment of $5.0 million toward the outstanding principal, plus a pro-rata portion of the final payment, by March 15, 2024. Under the terms of the amendment, principal amortization will be deferred between March 2024 and June 2024, totaling approximately $2.9 million. Amortization payments will recommence in July 2024, reflecting the prepayment and reducing prospective amortization payments in 2024 by approximately $3.3 million, in addition to significantly reducing interest owed over the term of the loan. There were no changes to the maturity date of the term loan, which is November 2026. “We are pleased to have strengthened our balance sheet through the imminent receipt of $5 million in non-dilutive capital at this important time,” said Dan Chevallard, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Viracta. “The proceeds will be used to make a partial prepayment of our outstanding debt balance, while also enabling a concurrent amendment to our credit facility to avail ourselves of an additional interest-only period through June 2024, and further reduce future amortization and interest payments reflecting the prepayment. Pro forma for this prepayment, we will have reduced our debt balance by over 25% since year-end to $18.6M and anticipate ending 2024 with less than $15 million in debt outstanding. The totality of this coordinated set of transactions will extend our cash runway into mid-Q1 2025 and provides a meaningful aggregate cash impact to Viracta well in excess of the proceeds.” Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2023 Financial Results Cash position – Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled approximately $53.7 million as of December 31, 2023. Pro forma for the aforementioned business transactions, our cash runway to fund operations is extended into mid-Q1 2025.Research and development expenses – Research and development expenses were approximately $9.4 million and $6.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Research and development expenses increased to $33.4 million compared to $26.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in research and development expenses in 2023 was primarily driven by increases in costs incurred to support the advancement and expansion of our clinical development programs, including incremental costs to support NAVAL-1, our pivotal trial of Nana-val in patients with R/R EBV+ lymphomas, and our Phase 1b/2 study of Nana-val in patients with advanced EBV+ solid tumors, as well as an increase in personnel-related costs.General and administrative expenses – General and administrative (G&A) expenses were approximately $4.2 million and $4.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, compared to $17.3 million and $24.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The decrease in G&A expenses year over year was largely due to a one-time expense associated with the modification of certain equity awards totaling $5.6 million and $0.8 million in severance-related charges associated with the transition of the former Chief Executive Officer in 2022. The decrease over the comparative three-month period was primarily due to a decrease in share-based compensation expense and corporate liability insurance premiums.Net loss – Net loss was approximately $13.8 million, or $0.35 per share (basic and diluted), for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to a net loss of $10.3 million or $0.27 per share (basic and diluted), for the same period in 2022. Net loss was approximately $51.1 million, or $1.32 per share (basic and diluted), for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a net loss of $49.2 million or $1.30 per share (basic and diluted), for the same period in 2022. About the NAVAL-1 Trial NAVAL-1 (NCT05011058) is a global, multicenter, clinical trial of Nana-val in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) lymphoma. This trial employs a Simon two-stage design where, in Stage 1, participants are enrolled into one of three indication cohorts based on EBV+ lymphoma subtype. If two objective responses are achieved within a lymphoma subtype in Stage 1 (n=10), then additional patients will be enrolled in Stage 2 for a total of 21 patients. EBV+ lymphoma subtypes demonstrating promising antitumor activity in Stage 2 may be further expanded following discussion with regulators to potentially support registration. About the Phase 1b/2 Study of Nana-val in Patients with Advanced EBV+ Solid Tumors (Study 301) This Phase 1b/2 trial (NCT05166577) is an open-label, multinational clinical trial evaluating Nana-val alone and in combination with pembrolizumab. The Phase 1b dose escalation part is designed to evaluate safety and to select the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Nana-val in patients with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Along with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Project Optimus initiative, at the start of Phase 2, up to 40 patients with R/M EBV+ NPC will be randomized to receive either the RP2D or a dose level below the RP2D in a dose-optimization cohort. Once the RP2D has been confirmed, up to 60 patients with R/M EBV+ NPC will be randomized to receive Nana-val at the RP2D with or without pembrolizumab to further evaluate antitumor activity, safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers. Additionally, patients with other advanced EBV+ solid tumors will be enrolled to receive Nana-val at the RP2D in a Phase 1b dose expansion cohort. About Nana-val (Nanatinostat and Valganciclovir) Nanatinostat is an orally available histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor being developed by Viracta. Nanatinostat is selective for specific isoforms of Class I HDACs, which are key to inducing viral genes that are epigenetically silenced in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated malignancies. Nanatinostat is currently being investigated in combination with the antiviral agent valganciclovir as an all-oral combination therapy, Nana-val, in various subtypes of EBV-associated malignancies. Ongoing trials include a pivotal, global, multicenter, open-label Phase 2 basket trial in multiple subtypes of relapsed or refractory (R/R) EBV+ lymphoma (NAVAL-1) as well as a multinational Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in patients with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) EBV+ NPC and other advanced EBV+ solid tumors. About Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma T-cell lymphomas comprise a heterogeneous group of rare and aggressive malignancies, including peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL). There are approximately 5,600 newly diagnosed T-cell lymphoma patients and approximately 2,600 newly diagnosed PTCL-NOS and AITL patients in the U.S. annually. Approximately 70% of these patients are either refractory to first-line therapy, or eventually experience relapse of their disease. Clinical trials are currently recommended for all lines of PTCL therapy, and most patients with R/R PTCL have poor outcomes, with median progression-free survival and median overall survival times reported to be 3.7 and 6.5 months, respectively. Approximately 40% to 65% of PTCL is associated with EBV, the incidence of EBV+ PTCL varies by geography, and reported outcomes for patients with EBV+ PTCL are inferior to those whose disease is EBV-negative. There is no approved targeted treatment specific for EBV+ PTCL, and therefore this represents a high unmet medical need. About EBV-Associated Cancers Approximately 90% of the world's adult population is infected with EBV. Infections are commonly asymptomatic or associated with mononucleosis. Following infection, the virus remains latent in a small subset of cells for the duration of the patient's life. Cells containing latent virus are increasingly susceptible to malignant transformation. Patients who are immunocompromised are at an increased risk of developing EBV-positive (EBV+) lymphomas. EBV is estimated to be associated with approximately 2% of the global cancer burden including lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and gastric cancer. About Viracta Therapeutics, Inc. Viracta is a clinical-stage precision oncology company focused on the treatment and prevention of virus-associated cancers that impact patients worldwide. Viracta’s lead product candidate is an all-oral combination therapy of its proprietary investigational drug, nanatinostat, and the antiviral agent valganciclovir (collectively referred to as Nana-val). Nana-val is currently being evaluated in multiple ongoing clinical trials, including a pivotal, global, multicenter, open-label Phase 2 basket trial for the treatment of multiple subtypes of relapsed or refractory (R/R) Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) lymphoma (NAVAL-1), as well as a multinational, open-label Phase 1b/2 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) EBV+ nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and other advanced EBV+ solid tumors. Viracta is also pursuing the application of its “Kick and Kill” approach in other virus-related cancers. For additional information, please visit www.viracta.com.

(NASDAQ: RDNT) plans to offer $200 million of common stock in a public offering, with an option for an additional $30 million. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and potential acquisitions. Positive None. Negative The offering may not be completed, and its size and terms are uncertain. There is a risk associated with market and other conditions affecting the offering. The use of proceeds for potential future acquisitions may not yield desired results. Financial Analyst RadNet, Inc.'s announcement of a $200 million public offering, with an additional $30 million option for underwriters, represents a significant capital-raising event that warrants close scrutiny from a financial perspective. The company's decision to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes and potential acquisitions suggests a strategic move to bolster its financial position and possibly expand its market presence. The offering size is substantial and could lead to dilution of existing shareholders' equity, but it also provides the company with a considerable amount of capital to pursue growth opportunities.Investors should consider the potential impact on RadNet's balance sheet, particularly in terms of cash reserves and debt levels. The influx of capital may improve liquidity and reduce leverage, which can be favorable for the company's credit rating and borrowing costs. However, the market's reception to the offering will be crucial, as it will determine the pricing of shares and the resulting market capitalization. A successful offering at a favorable price could signal investor confidence and support for RadNet's growth strategy. Market Research Analyst The diagnostic imaging services industry is highly competitive and capital-intensive. RadNet's move to secure additional funding through a public offering could be indicative of the company's intent to maintain or enhance its competitive edge, possibly through acquisitions that could expand its service offerings or geographical footprint. The industry trend has been toward consolidation, with larger players acquiring smaller or regional competitors to achieve economies of scale and broaden their service portfolios.For stakeholders, it is important to assess how this offering aligns with industry trends and RadNet's historical performance in mergers and acquisitions. A successful track record in integrating acquisitions and realizing synergies could make this capital raise a positive indicator for future growth. Conversely, if the market perceives the company's acquisition strategy as risky or its execution as poor, the offering could be viewed less favorably. Market reception will also hinge on broader economic conditions, including interest rates and investor sentiment towards the healthcare sector. Legal Expert It is crucial for investors to understand the legal framework surrounding public offerings. RadNet is leveraging a shelf registration statement, which allows for the quick sale of securities to the public, providing the company with flexibility in capital raising. The legal stipulations, such as the 30-day option for underwriters to purchase additional shares, are standard in underwritten offerings and provide a cushion for potential over-allotments.The company's adherence to SEC regulations, including the filing of a preliminary prospectus supplement, is a mandatory step that provides transparency and detailed information about the offering. Potential investors should carefully review these documents to understand the terms of the offering and the risks involved. The legal disclaimer included in the announcement is a standard caution against assuming the completion of the sale, emphasizing the importance of the registration and qualification under the relevant securities laws. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM LOS ANGELES, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RadNet, Inc.

The Company aims to explore an extended dosing schedule for KB-0742 and expects to share topline data from the expansion cohort in the first half of 2025. IND-enabling studies for KB-9558 are set to complete in 2024 with a first-in-human study anticipated in 2025. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst From an investor's perspective, the announcement by Kronos Bio is significant due to its potential implications for the company's financial health and future revenue streams. The focus on the development of KB-0742, a CDK9 inhibitor and KB-9558, a p300 KAT inhibitor, is indicative of the company's strategic prioritization of assets with a perceived high potential for clinical success and market penetration. The restructuring plan, including a 21% reduction in workforce, is a cost-containment measure that aims to extend the company's cash runway into the second half of 2026, which is a critical factor for investors concerned with the company's operational sustainability in the absence of revenue-generating products.Furthermore, the planned presentation of topline data from the expanded cohort in the first half of 2025 is a future milestone that could influence the stock's performance, depending on the outcomes. Positive data could lead to increased investor confidence and possible partnerships or funding opportunities, while negative results could adversely affect the company's valuation. The timing of the IND-enabling studies for KB-9558 and the subsequent first-in-human study commencement is also crucial as it marks the transition from preclinical to clinical development, a phase where the risk profile of the investment changes significantly. Medical Research Analyst The therapeutic landscape for cancer is highly competitive, with a continuous need for treatments that can address the limitations of current therapies. KB-0742, targeting CDK9, represents a novel approach to treating transcriptionally addicted tumors. CDK9 is a cyclin-dependent kinase involved in the regulation of transcription and its inhibition could disrupt the growth of certain cancer cells. The absence of grade 3/4 neutropenia, a common and serious side effect associated with many cancer therapies, at the doses tested so far is noteworthy from a clinical perspective.The decision to explore an extended dosing schedule is an example of dose optimization, which could enhance the therapeutic index of KB-0742 by maximizing efficacy while minimizing toxicity. The 3+3 design mentioned is a traditional dose-escalation study format used to identify the maximum tolerated dose of a drug. The selection of small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, or triple negative breast cancer for the expansion cohort suggests a targeted approach towards cancers with high unmet needs. Oncology Doctor As a medical professional in the field of oncology, the development of KB-0742 and KB-9558 is of particular interest due to their potential to offer new treatment options for difficult-to-treat cancers. The mechanism of action for these compounds, with KB-0742 inhibiting CDK9 and KB-9558 targeting the p300 KAT enzyme, reflects a move towards targeted therapy in oncology, which aims to be more effective and less toxic than traditional chemotherapy.The selection of tumor types for the expansion cohort is strategic, focusing on cancers with limited treatment options and poor prognoses, such as triple negative breast cancer. The ability to show anti-tumor activity without significant neutropenia is promising, as it suggests a favorable safety profile that could be a differentiating factor in the competitive landscape of oncology drugs. The extended dosing schedule could also offer improved quality of life for patients if it leads to fewer side effects or better management of the disease. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM Company to assess KB-0742 at planned new dose schedule in ongoing phase 1/2 study; topline data from expansion cohort at new dose schedule expected in the first half of 2025 IND-enabling studies for KB-9558 expected to complete in 2024 with first-in-human study anticipated to commence in 2025 Restructuring plan extends anticipated cash runway into the second half of 2026 Company to continue to focus discovery efforts on maturing projects and Genentech collaboration activities SAN MATEO, Calif., and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kronos Bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: KRON), a company dedicated to transforming the lives of those affected by cancer, today announced a plan to optimize its resource allocation, restructure, and extend runway to focus resources on key programs in the Company’s pipeline, including the ongoing phase 1/2 study of KB-0742 following the review of additional positive preliminary safety and efficacy data. This plan positions the Company to maximize the potential of KB-0742, an inhibitor of CDK9, by exploring an extended dosing schedule while also continuing to progress KB-9558, a p300 KAT inhibitor, through ongoing IND-enabling studies and into the clinic, and its discovery efforts and collaborations. The Company expects these efforts, which include a 21% reduction in force, will extend cash runway into the second half of 2026. To date, anti-tumor activity has been observed without grade 3/4 neutropenia in patients treated with KB-0742 at doses ranging from 10mg to 80mg using the current three-days-on, four-days-off dosing schedule. The Company has reported target engagement, tumor regressions, and an acceptable safety profile at 60mg dosed three-days-on, four-days-off. KB-0742 cleared 80mg three-days-on, four-days-off and the Company expects to publish this data in addition to the 60mg expansion mid-year. As disclosed earlier this week, the Company plans to escalate to 80mg four-days-on, three-days-off, a dosing schedule that offers patients significantly increased time at or above a therapeutic threshold compared to the already established active dose of 60mg dosed three-days-on, four-days-off. The amended protocol leverages a 3+3 design, placing the Company on a path to efficiently clear the dose levels, and the Company expects to share topline data from the expansion cohort at this dose schedule in the first half of 2025. “We are committed to exploring the promise of our pipeline. Building upon the positive data for KB-0742 that we have previously reported, these measures enable us to assess the potential for additional clinical benefit of the drug at an extended dosing schedule in patients with transcriptionally addicted tumors,” said Norbert Bischofberger, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Kronos Bio. “The measures we have taken today, while difficult, will streamline our operations, extend our runway, and best position us to advance our maturing discovery projects, including our collaboration with Genentech, and to advance KB-9558 through IND-enabling studies and into the clinic. I want to express my gratitude to all our employees, including those departing Kronos Bio today, for their contributions to our mission to bring forward new and innovative therapies for difficult-to-treat cancers.” In December, KB-0742 cleared the 80mg dose in the dose escalation portion of the phase 1/2 trial using a three-days-on, four-days-off dosing schedule. Before escalating to the planned dosing schedule of 80mg four-days-on, three-days-off, the Company is currently evaluating 60mg of KB-0742 four-days-on, three-days-off in three evaluable patients as contemplated by a 3+3 design. If the safety profile of KB-0742 remains acceptable, the Company will then evaluate safety in three additional patients at 80mg four-days-on, three-days-off prior to enrolling patients in an expansion cohort. The Company currently contemplates the expansion cohort will include patients with either small cell or non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, or triple negative breast cancer, and expects to provide an update later in the year on which tumor type(s) will be included in the expansion cohort. The Company intends to present updated data at a medical meeting in mid-2024 based on data that have been collected from patients who have received doses of KB-0742 of 60mg or 80mg using the prior three-days-on, four-days-off dosing schedule. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company expects to provide an update from the new four days per week dosing schedule and announce its plans for the dose expansion portion of the phase 1/2 trial. In the first half of 2025, Kronos Bio plans to present topline safety and efficacy data at a medical meeting from patients on the new four-days-on, three-days-off dosing schedule. On April 8, 2024, Kronos Bio will present preclinical data on KB-9558 in multiple myeloma at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) annual meeting in San Diego, California. Pending the completion of IND-enabling studies in 2024, the Company expects to commence a first-in-human study in multiple myeloma in 2025. About Kronos Bio, Inc.

This growth trajectory is a positive signal for investors and analysts, suggesting an increasing market adoption of the TULSA-PRO® systems. The expansion of the installed base and the anticipation of further growth to 75 units in 2024 could serve as a leading indicator for future revenue streams.However, the company's operating expenses have also increased, notably in R&D and S&D, which may raise concerns about the company's profitability in the short term. The 5% increase in total operating expenses, despite a 28% rise in R&D costs, could be indicative of strategic investments in product development and market expansion efforts, which may pay off in the long term.Furthermore, the company's liquidity position appears strengthened by the public offering and private placement of common shares, resulting in a cash position of approximately $45.4 million as of January 31, 2024. This improved liquidity is crucial for supporting ongoing clinical trials, such as the CAPTAIN trial and further R&D initiatives. Medical Research Analyst The introduction of Profound's next AI-based module, Contouring Assistant, currently under FDA review, is a significant development. If approved, it could potentially reduce procedure times and boost urologist confidence in adopting the TULSA procedure. This could have a substantial impact on the company's market share in the prostate ablation sector, especially considering the reported usage of TULSA-PRO® across various prostate disease treatments.The ongoing Level 1 CAPTAIN trial's progress is another critical factor. It compares the TULSA procedure to radical prostatectomy, which, if favorable, could lead to a paradigm shift in the treatment of localized prostate cancer. The trial's success could substantially increase the credibility and adoption of TULSA-PRO®, thereby impacting future revenues and market positioning. Market Research Analyst The announcement of a non-exclusive collaboration with Siemens Healthineers is poised to expand physician and patient access to the TULSA procedure. This strategic move could enhance the company's distribution network and potentially increase market penetration. Additionally, the anticipated permanent CPT® Category 1 codes for TULSA, effective from 2025, may act as an inflection point, simplifying the reimbursement process and accelerating adoption rates.The company's performance in securing installations or contracts with 10 of the top 20 cancer hospitals in the United States is a testament to the product's clinical acceptance and could serve as a strong marketing point. However, the substantial increase in S&D expenses, including marketing and salesforce expansion, needs to be monitored to ensure that it correlates with revenue growth and does not unduly strain financial resources. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM TORONTO, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Profound Medical Corp. (NASDAQ:PROF; TSX:PRN) (“Profound” or the “Company”), a commercial-stage medical device company that develops and markets customizable, incision-free therapies for the ablation of diseased tissue, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Unless specified otherwise, all amounts in this press release are expressed in U.S. dollars and are presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. Business Highlights Q4-2023 recurring revenue growth of 60% over Q4-2022.TULSA-PRO® systems installed base now totals 50; Profound continues to expect to grow that to 75 TULSA-PRO® systems in 2024.To date, TULSA-PRO® has been installed at, or contracted with, 10 of the top 20 cancer hospitals in the United States as ranked by U.S. News and World Report.Profound continued to see a wide variety of prostate disease patients treated by its TULSA-PRO® customers in Q4-2023: Approximately 67% were treated for prostate cancer, 23% were hybrid patients suffering from both prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (“BPH”), 7% were salvage, and 3% were men with BPH only;For cancer grade, approximately 13% were GG1, 55% were GG2, 22% were GG3, and 10% were GG4 & GG5;In terms of ablation, approximately 53% were whole gland; 23% were sub-total but more than half the gland; 24% were focal therapy; andFor prostate size, approximately 3% were < 20cc; 39% were 20 – 40cc; 32% were 40-60cc; 21% were 60-100cc; and 5% were over 100cc. The ongoing Level 1 CAPTAIN trial comparing the TULSA procedure to radical prostatectomy in men with localized prostate cancer remains on track to complete patient enrollment by the end of this year. Last week, Profound announced it had entered into non-exclusive collaboration with Siemens Healthineers designed to further expand physician and patient access to the TULSA procedure.Today, the Company announces the promotion of Mathieu Burtnyk, PhD, from SVP Product Leader to Chief Operating Officer. “Our preparations continue for the permanent CPT® Category 1 codes for TULSA going into effect at the beginning of 2025, an anticipated inflection point for our business,” said Arun Menawat, Profound’s CEO and Chairman. “In addition, our next AI based module, called Contouring Assistant, that enables creation of suggested treatment design based upon the specific prostate anatomy of each patient, is now under U.S. Food and Drug Administration review. Based upon user feedback, we believe this upgrade will not only further increase urologists’ confidence in treating more of their patients with TULSA, but it is also expected to reduce total TULSA procedure times.” Summary Fourth Quarter 2023 Results For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded revenue of approximately $2.0 million, with the full amount coming from recurring revenue, which consists of the sale of TULSA-PRO® consumables, lease of medical devices, procedures and services associated with extended warranties. Fourth quarter 2023 revenue increased 60% from approximately $1.3 million in the same three-month period a year ago. Total operating expenses, which consist of research and development (“R&D”), general and administrative (“G&A”), and selling and distribution (“S&D”) expenses, were approximately $9.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 5% compared with approximately $9.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, which included the Company’s recognition of a non-cash impairment of approximately $2.5 million in the period. Expenditures for R&D for the three months ended December 31, 2023 were approximately $4.0 million, an increase of 28% compared with approximately $3.1 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily driven by improved enrollment for the CAPTAIN trial and recruitment efforts, additional consultants hired to assist with the clinical and regulatory affairs of the business, additional travel associated with system installation and testing, increased salaries and personnel during the period and increased software costs associated with thermal boost and artificial intelligence development. These were offset partially by a decrease to material costs. G&A expenses for the 2023 fourth quarter increased by 41% to approximately $3.0 million, compared with approximately $2.1 million in the same period in 2022. Salaries and benefits, consulting fees, rent expense and expected credit loss allowance increased due to higher cost of living salary increases and bonuses awarded to management, increased legal and accounting fees associated with the establishment of the Company’s at-the-market equity program, and lower refund for utility and tax overpayment. Partially offsetting this was a decrease to share-based compensation due to fewer options awarded to employees. Fourth quarter 2023 S&D expenses increased by 74% to approximately $2.9 million, compared with $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. This was driven by increased salaries and benefits, consulting fees, share-based compensation and marketing, due to increased salesforce and commission payments, reimbursement and foreign consultants engaged to assist with sales efforts, additional awards granted for employees and increased in-person conferences, customer meetings, release of patient videos and marketing materials. These were partially offset by a decrease in other expenses due to the reduced mobile MRI time as part of the Company’s U.S. sales initiative and lower general expenditures. Net finance costs for the three months ended December 31, 2023 were approximately $356,000, compared with approximately $499,000 in the three months ended December 31, 2022. Fourth quarter 2023 net loss was approximately $8.9 million, or $0.42 per common share, compared to approximately $9.5 million, or $0.46 per common share, in the three months ended December 31, 2022. Summary Full Year 2023 Results For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded revenue of approximately $7.2 million, with $6.8 million from recurring revenue and $393,000 from the one-time sale of capital equipment in international markets. This compares to revenue of approximately $6.7 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, with $4.7 million from recurring revenue and $2.0 million from the one-time sale of capital equipment. Profound’s full year 2023 total operating expenses were approximately $33.0 million, a 6% decrease compared to approximately $35.1 million in 2022. Expenditures for R&D for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023 were approximately $14.4 million, a decrease of 2% compared with approximately $14.7 million in 2022. This was primarily driven by decreases in salaries and benefits, share-based compensation, and office supplies. Partially offsetting these was an increase in clinical trial costs, materials, consulting fees, rent and other expenditures. G&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased 3% to approximately $9.2 million from $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This was due to a decrease in salaries and benefits, share-based compensation, software cost and other expense, offset partially by an increase in consulting fees, insurance costs and expected credit loss allowance. Full year 2023 S&D expenses were approximately $9.5 million, an increase of 12% from $8.5 million in 2022. Increases in salaries and benefits, consulting fees, marketing, travel and other expenses were partially offset by a decrease in share-based compensation due to fewer options awarded to employees. Net finance expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately $81,000, which compared to net finance income of approximately $3.7 million in 2022, which was primarily due to a foreign exchange in the year. The Company recorded a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 of approximately $28.6 million, or $1.35 per common share, compared to approximately $28.7 million, or $1.38 per common share, for the year ended December 31, 2023. Liquidity and Outstanding Share Capital As at December 31, 2023, Profound had cash of approximately $26.2 million. Subsequent to year end, the Company completed a public offering and a private placement of common shares, resulting it in having approximate cash of $45.4 million as at January 31, 2024. As at March 7, 2024, Profound had 24,428,899 common shares issued and outstanding.

Maturity dates extended to 2029, revenue requirements reset, EBITDA requirements removed, and interest rate margin reduced to 6.50%. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The amendment of Xtant Medical Holdings' credit agreement to expand its revolving credit facility from $8.0 million to $17.0 million and the addition of a $10.0 million tranche for potential acquisitions, signal a strategic move to bolster the company's financial flexibility. The extended maturity dates and the adjustment in financial covenants, such as the removal of minimum Adjusted EBITDA requirements, will likely ease the company's short-term liquidity pressures and provide a more favorable debt servicing scenario. The reduction in the interest rate on the term loan, albeit modest, will also contribute to lower financial costs over time.From an investor's perspective, these amendments could be interpreted as a positive indicator of the company's relationship with its lender and its creditworthiness. However, investors should closely monitor the company's subsequent use of this increased financial leverage, particularly in terms of acquisitions, as these moves can have varying impacts on shareholder value depending on the strategic fit and execution of the acquired assets. Market Research Analyst The medical technology sector often requires significant capital investment for research, development and expansion. Xtant Medical's focus on surgical solutions for spinal disorders places it in a niche yet growing market segment. The company's decision to secure additional funding for inventory and working capital needs could indicate an anticipated increase in product demand or expansion into new markets.Market trends show an increasing prevalence of spinal disorders due to aging populations and lifestyle factors, which could mean a larger addressable market for Xtant's products. The ability to acquire complementary businesses or technologies could further enhance its market position. However, the success of such strategies will depend on the company's ability to integrate acquisitions effectively and realize synergies. Medical Device Industry Expert Within the medical device industry, the terms of credit and the ability to secure funding are critical for maintaining the necessary levels of inventory and for pursuing strategic acquisitions. Xtant Medical's amended credit terms suggest a proactive approach to managing its capital structure in a way that supports its growth initiatives. The focus on spinal surgical solutions, a specialized area within medical devices, requires continuous innovation and potentially strategic partnerships or acquisitions to stay competitive.Investors and stakeholders should consider the implications of these financial maneuvers on the company's ability to maintain its competitive edge, invest in product innovation and meet the evolving needs of the healthcare market. The removal of the minimum Adjusted EBITDA requirements may also suggest a period of investment and potential variability in profitability as the company pursues growth. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM BELGRADE, Mont., March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Xtant Medical Holdings, Inc.

The company submitted a 510(k) premarket notification for CanGarooRM to the FDA, with positive interactions and no requests for additional data. Elutia closed the divestiture of the orthobiologics business, generating $14.6 million in cash proceeds. The company established a Strategic Advisory Committee for the commercial launch of CanGarooRM. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Elutia Inc.'s financial results highlight a mixed performance with robust revenue growth in proprietary product lines, particularly SimpliDerm, yet a reduction in overall net sales in the fourth quarter. The strategic divestiture of the orthobiologics business, yielding $14.6 million, indicates a refocusing of the company's core competencies and a potential strengthening of their cash position. Notably, the gross margin's decline, both GAAP and adjusted, reflects the impact of the LeMaitre Vascular distribution agreement, which appears to have traded higher margins for volume through distributor relationships.Investors should consider the implications of the 510(k) premarket notification for CanGarooRM. This product could significantly affect Elutia's market share in the drug-eluting envelope market, a substantial sector valued at over $600 million. However, the net loss figures, despite improvement in operational performance, suggest that Elutia is still navigating the path to profitability. The adjusted EBITDA improvement is a positive indicator, but the company's ability to sustain and improve this trajectory post-commercial launch of CanGarooRM will be critical for long-term financial health. Medical Device Market Analyst Elutia's submission of the 510(k) premarket notification for CanGarooRM and the lack of additional data requests from the FDA are promising signs for the product's approval and subsequent commercial launch. The market positioning of CanGarooRM is strategic, being the second entrant in the drug-eluting envelope market. Its unique combination of a biological envelope with potent antibiotics could offer a competitive advantage, potentially disrupting the market dynamics. The focused launch plan, leveraging a proprietary sales force and distribution network, indicates a targeted go-to-market strategy that could expedite market penetration and adoption among healthcare professionals.The long-term success of CanGarooRM will hinge on its clinical efficacy, cost-effectiveness and the ability to differentiate from competitors. The anticipation surrounding FDA clearance is a pivotal moment for Elutia, with potential implications for market share, revenue growth and investor confidence. Stakeholders should monitor the adoption rate post-launch and the company's ability to scale operations while managing costs to maximize the product's commercial potential. Healthcare Industry Analyst Elutia's operational strategy, including the divestiture of its orthobiologics business and the establishment of a Strategic Advisory Committee, suggests a deliberate shift towards prioritizing high-growth areas like SimpliDerm and CanGaroo. The company's focus on these proprietary products, especially with the upcoming launch of CanGarooRM, aligns with industry trends towards specialization and innovation in medical devices. The healthcare industry's response to Elutia's new offerings will be critical, as adoption by surgeons and favorable reimbursement policies could significantly impact Elutia's market position and financial outcomes.From a broader industry perspective, Elutia's developments should be viewed in the context of increasing demand for advanced medical technologies that enhance patient care and outcomes. The strategic advisory committee's role in guiding the commercial launch could be a key factor in navigating the complex healthcare landscape, ensuring that CanGarooRM's market entry is executed with clinical and commercial precision. Stakeholders should assess the potential long-term benefits of Elutia's strategic decisions against the backdrop of an evolving healthcare environment that values innovation and patient-centric solutions. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM SILVER SPRING, Md., March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Elutia Inc.

Business Highlights: Achieved strong annual revenue growth for both proprietary product lines, with sales increasing for SimpliDerm by 38% and CanGaroo by 3.4%.Submitted a 510(k) premarket notification to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA” or “Agency”) for CanGarooRM, Elutia’s next-generation drug-eluting biomatrix product.FDA review and interaction for CanGarooRM has resulted in no requests for additional data to date. The Company remains on track for a clearance decision in the first half of 2024.Successfully closed the divestiture of the orthobiologics business, generating gross cash proceeds of $14.6 million.Established a Strategic Advisory Committee of industry experts to prepare for commercial launch of CanGarooRM. ""After years of pioneering development, we are on the verge of introducing the drug-eluting biomatrix that promises to remove compromise from patient care,"" stated Dr. Randy Mills, Elutia’s Chief Executive Officer. ""In 2023, we completed the groundwork for our flagship product, CanGarooRM, resulting in a high-quality submission to FDA. Since then, our interactions with the Agency have been positive, and we look forward to a clearance decision in the first half of this year."" Dr. Mills continued, ""I’d like to thank our dedicated commercial and operational teams, who, throughout this process, have stayed laser-focused, delivering robust sales figures across our SimpliDerm and CanGaroo product lines. They are now focused on a coordinated and disciplined product rollout of CanGarooRM, ensuring its full potential is realized."" CanGarooRM Update In December 2023, Elutia submitted a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA for CanGarooRM following a successful pre-submission meeting with the FDA. The Company is in ongoing discussions with FDA regarding the submission. To date, clarification requests from the Agency have been limited to items within the new submission, and no additional data has been requested. Elutia expects the FDA's clearance decision in the first half of 2024 and is preparing for commercial launch. CanGarooRM is uniquely positioned for success in the drug-eluting envelope market, estimated at over $600 million annually in the United States. As the second market entrant and the only product offering a combination of a biological envelope and potent antibiotics, CanGarooRM is poised to compete effectively. Surgeons particularly appreciate the handling characteristics of a natural biological product. Elutia has developed a focused launch plan, leveraging the Company’s proprietary sales force and distribution network. The Company’s commercial team, equipped with extensive product knowledge and experience, is ready to engage healthcare professionals to drive adoption. 2023 Financial Results For the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 2022 (where applicable): Overall net sales were $24.7 million, compared to $23.8 million. The increase was driven by a $2.8 million increase in Women’s Health sales and a $0.3 million increase in Device Protection. Growth in Women’s Health and Device Protection was partially offset by a reduction in sales in the Cardiovascular line of business due to the commencement of the Company’s distribution agreement with LeMaitre Vascular, which provides for sales at a contracted price to the distributor, whereas sales prior to such agreement were made at end-user pricing.Gross margin on a GAAP basis, which includes amortization of acquired intangible assets, was 45%, compared to 49%. The reduction was primarily due to the commencement of the LeMaitre Vascular distribution agreement described above.Adjusted gross margin (a non-GAAP measure that excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets) was 58%, compared to 63%. A reconciliation of adjusted gross margin to gross margin is provided in the financial tables below.Total operating expenses were $41.6 million, compared to $46.8 million. The reduction resulted from efforts to optimize the Company’s operations, primarily in sales and marketing and research and development.Net loss was $37.7 million, compared to a net loss of $32.9 million.Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) was a loss of $14.6 million, compared to a loss of $22.9 million, reflecting the significant improvement in the Company’s operational performance. Adjusted EBITDA excludes from net loss certain non-operating, non-cash and non-recurring items. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss is provided in the financial tables below.Cash was $19.3 million as of December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results For the three-month period ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the same period of 2022: Overall net sales were $5.9 million, compared to $6.6 million. The decrease of 11% was primarily due to a $1.3 million decrease in sales of Cardiovascular products resulting from the commencement of the LeMaitre Vascular distribution relationship, partially offset by a $0.8 million increase in SimpliDerm sales.Gross margin on a GAAP basis was 36%, compared to 47%. The year-over-year reduction was primarily due to the commencement of the LeMaitre Vascular distribution relationship for the Company’s Cardiovascular products.Adjusted gross margin (a non-GAAP measure) was 51%, compared to 59%.Total operating expenses were $10.6 million, compared to $12.6 million.Net loss was $9.3 million, compared to a net loss of $5.4 million.Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) was a loss of $4.5 million, compared to a loss of $4.6 million.

Non-GAAP Disclosure In addition to the Company's financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company provides non-GAAP measures that it determines to be useful in evaluating its operating performance and liquidity. The Company presents in this press release the following non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“adjusted EBITDA”), adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross profit. The Company defines EBITDA as GAAP net loss excluding interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and the Company defines adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding income from discontinued operations, stock-based compensation, FiberCel litigation costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, net of gain on debt forgiveness, loss on revaluation of warranty liability and gain on revaluation of revenue interest obligation. The Company defines adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin as GAAP gross profit and GAAP gross margin, respectively, excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets. The amortization of these intangible assets will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Management believes that presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of the Company's core operating results and comparison of operating results across reporting periods. The Company uses this non-GAAP financial information to establish budgets, manage the Company's business, and set incentive and compensation arrangements. Non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental information purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP, see below “Non-GAAP Reconciliations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA” and “Non-GAAP Reconciliations of Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin.” Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Reports Fiscal Year 2023 Revenue Growth of 33% Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Grindr Inc. reported robust 2023 Q4 and full-year 2023 earnings, with $260 million in revenue, $55 million in operating income, a 21% net loss margin, and a 42% adjusted EBITDA margin. The company saw a 38% increase in revenue from paying users, with 121 billion chats sent in 2023. Grindr anticipates a 23% or greater revenue growth and a 40%+ adjusted EBITDA margin in 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported revenue of $260 million and operating income of $55 million for Grindr Inc. in the fiscal year 2023 are significant indicators of the company's financial health and operational efficiency. The net loss margin of 21% suggests that despite generating substantial revenue, the company is still incurring more expenses than it can offset with its income. This might raise concerns about the company's cost management strategies or indicate heavy investments in growth initiatives. On the other hand, the adjusted EBITDA margin of 42% is a strong sign of the company's earning potential before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization are considered. This high margin could signal to investors that Grindr has robust core operations and potential for profitability once non-operational costs are streamlined. Market Research Analyst The user engagement metrics, with 121 billion chats sent in 2023 and users spending approximately an hour per day on the app, are indicative of a highly engaged user base, which is a critical asset for any social platform. The 38% increase in revenue from paying users demonstrates effective monetization strategies and suggests that Grindr's value proposition is resonating well with its target audience. The introduction of 'Weeklies,' a weekly subscription product, appears to be a successful innovation in driving revenue growth. Looking ahead, the guidance of 23% or greater revenue growth and a 40%+ adjusted EBITDA margin for 2024 indicates that the company anticipates continued strong performance and profitability, which could positively influence investor sentiment and the company's stock valuation. Economist Grindr's financial results reflect broader economic trends in the digital and social media sectors, where user engagement and subscription models are increasingly important revenue drivers. The company's growth trajectory and its ability to increase revenue from paying users by 38% in a competitive market is commendable. The projected revenue growth of 23% or greater for 2024 is an optimistic forecast that outpaces average industry growth rates, suggesting that Grindr is successfully capturing market share and expanding its user base in the LGBTQ community. However, the net loss margin raises questions about scalability and the elasticity of demand for premium services in a potentially niche market. Long-term sustainability will depend on the company's ability to balance growth with cost control and to navigate the economic headwinds that may affect discretionary consumer spending. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM Grindr Inc.

Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs, current expectations or projections concerning, among other things, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the markets in which we operate. In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of terminology such as “anticipates,” “approximately,” “believes,” “continues,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “outlook,” “plans,” “potential,” “predicts,” “seeks,” “should,” “will” or the negative version of these words or other comparable words or phrases. The forward-looking statements, including guidance related to revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin, reflect our current views about our business and future events and are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. There are no guarantees that any transactions or events described will happen as described (or that they will happen at all). The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth in or contemplated by the forward-looking statements: our ability to retain existing users and add new users; the impact of the regulatory environment and complexities with compliance related to such environment, including maintaining compliance with privacy, data protection, and user safety laws and regulations; our ability to address privacy concerns and protect systems and infrastructure from cyber-attacks and prevent unauthorized data access; our success in retaining or recruiting our directors, officers, key employees, or other key personnel, and our success in managing any changes in such roles; our ability to respond to general economic conditions; competition in the dating and social networking products and services industry; our ability to adapt to changes in technology and user preferences in a timely and cost-effective manner; our dependence on the integrity of third-party systems and infrastructure; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties; whether the concentration of our stock ownership and voting power limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters; and the effects of macroeconomic and geopolitical events on our business, such as health epidemics, pandemics, natural disasters and wars or other regional conflicts. In addition, statements that “Grindr believes” or “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subjects as of the date of any such statement. These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date they are made, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and such statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. While forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future performance. Except to the extent required by applicable law, we are under no obligation (and expressly disclaim any such obligation) to update or revise our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. For a further discussion of these and other factors that could cause our future results, performance or transactions to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement, please see the section titled “Risk Factors” in annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are based only on information currently available to us (or to third parties making the forward-looking statements). About Non-GAAP Measures We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income excluding income tax provision (benefit); interest expense, net; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; severance expenses; transaction-related costs; litigation-related costs for matters unrelated to the Company's ongoing business, including those matters incurred as part of the business combination pursuant to which on May 9, 2022, Grindr Group LLC and its subsidiaries (“Legacy Grindr”) entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended on October 5, 2022) with Tiga Acquisition Corp. (“Tiga”), in which Legacy Grindr would become a wholly owned subsidiary of Tiga (“Business Combination”); Legacy Grindr management fees; loss on extinguishment of debt; (loss) gain in fair value of warrant liability and other expense that is unrelated to Grindr's core ongoing business operations. Our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business and this measure is one of the primary metrics by which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. We exclude the above items as some are non-cash in nature, and others may not be representative of normal operating results. Adjusted EBITDA adjusts for the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of the operational performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by revenue for the same period. While we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of net loss and net loss margin to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are presented below. We are not able to estimate net income (loss) or net income (loss) margin on a forward-looking basis or reconcile the guidance provided for Adjusted EBITDA margin to net income (loss) margin on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable efforts due to the variability and complexity with respect to the charges excluded from Adjusted EBITDA margin.

(SVRA) remains on track to report top-line data from the pivotal Phase 3 IMPALA-2 trial by the end of the second quarter of 2024. The 48-week placebo-controlled trial is evaluating molgramostim nebulizer solution for the treatment of autoimmune Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (aPAP), a rare lung disease. The company anticipates filing a Biologics License Application (BLA) in the first half of 2025 pending the outcome of the IMPALA-2 trial. With approximately $162 million in cash and short-term investments, Savara believes it is sufficiently capitalized into 2026. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst From a medical research perspective, the progression of the Phase 3 IMPALA-2 trial is a critical milestone for Savara Inc. The trial's focus on molgramostim, an inhaled biologic for the treatment of autoimmune Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (aPAP), addresses a significant unmet medical need given the rarity and severity of the disease. The anticipation of filing a Biologics License Application (BLA) indicates confidence in the potential efficacy and safety of the treatment. The patient population identified through the health claims database underscores the market potential for molgramostim, should it receive approval.Furthermore, the development of aPAP ClearPath™, a GM-CSF autoantibody blood test, represents an advancement in diagnostic capabilities for aPAP. This could lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment, improving patient outcomes and potentially increasing the treatment-eligible population. The disease awareness campaign is likely to increase recognition of aPAP symptoms among pulmonologists, potentially leading to more diagnoses and a larger target market for Savara's product. Financial Analyst Financially, Savara Inc.'s statement of having approximately $162 million in cash and short-term investments is a strong indicator of its fiscal health and its ability to fund operations into 2026. This financial runway is crucial as it allows the company to continue its research and development activities without the immediate need for additional capital. The upcoming top line data from the IMPALA-2 trial will be a significant catalyst for the company's stock as positive results could lead to an increase in investor confidence and potential partnerships or funding opportunities.However, investors should note the inherent risks associated with biopharmaceutical companies in the clinical stage. The success of Savara's stock will heavily depend on the outcomes of the IMPALA-2 trial and the subsequent regulatory path. Positive trial data and a successful BLA filing could result in stock appreciation, while any setbacks could negatively impact the company's valuation. Market Research Analyst The rare disease market, particularly for conditions like aPAP, is often characterized by high drug prices due to the specialized nature of treatments and the lack of competition. If molgramostim is approved, Savara Inc. could potentially capitalize on orphan drug status, which may provide market exclusivity and other incentives. The identification of approximately 3,600 diagnosed and 1,400 potential undiagnosed aPAP patients in the U.S. alone provides a clearer picture of the addressable market for investors.Moreover, the strategic initiatives, including the launch of aPAP ClearPath™ and the disease awareness campaign, can be seen as efforts to build a foundation for market penetration. These initiatives not only aid in diagnosis but also help in creating a potential customer base for Savara's product. The successful commercialization of molgramostim will hinge on effective marketing strategies and the ability to navigate the complexities of the healthcare reimbursement landscape. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM Remains On-Track to Report Top Line Data from the Pivotal Phase 3 IMPALA-2 Trial by End of 2Q 2024 48-week placebo-controlled trial is evaluating molgramostim nebulizer solution (molgramostim), a novel inhaled biologic, for the treatment of autoimmune Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (aPAP), a rare lung disease Anticipate Filing Biologics License Application (BLA) in 1H 2025, Pending Outcome of IMPALA-2 Trial With ~$162M in Cash and Short-term Investments, Company Believes it is Sufficiently Capitalized into 2026 LANGHORNE, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Savara Inc. (Nasdaq: SVRA) (the Company), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on rare respiratory diseases, reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ending December 31, 2023 and provided a business update. “We look forward to reporting IMPALA-2 top line results at the end of the second quarter and, assuming positive data, anticipate filing the BLA in the first half of 2025,” said Matt Pauls, Chair and CEO, Savara. “2023 was a year of strong execution that included the on-time, over-enrollment of the Phase 3 IMPALA-2 trial and an analysis of a health claims database that identified ~3,600 currently diagnosed aPAP patients and another ~1,400 potential, currently undiagnosed, aPAP patients in the U.S. Additionally, we launched aPAP ClearPathTM, a simple, accurate, no-cost, lab-developed GM-CSF autoantibody blood test, along with a disease state awareness campaign, that is educating U.S. pulmonologists about the disease and need for earlier testing. Finally, we completed an $80 million equity financing last July, and with $162 million in cash and investments and a track record of strong fiscal discipline, we believe we are capitalized into 2026.” Fourth Quarter Financial Results (Unaudited) Savara’s net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $16.1 million, or $(0.09) per share, compared with a net loss of $10.3 million, or $(0.07) per share, for the fourth quarter of 2022. Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022 were $12.7 million and $7.6 million, respectively. General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022 were $4.9 million and $3.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $162.3 million. Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results The Company’s net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $54.7 million, or $(0.33) per share, compared with a net loss of $38.2 million, or $(0.25) per share for the year ended December 31, 2022. Research and development expenses increased $16.4 million, or 58.8%, to $44.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the performance of tasks related to our molgramostim program which includes approximately $6.8 million of costs related to our chemistry, manufacturing, and controls activities, $4.4 million of costs related to our IMPALA-2 trial, including CRO-related activities, $1.6 million of costs related to quality assurance, and $3.6 million due to an increase in personnel and related costs. General and administrative expenses increased $4.7 million, or 43.4%, to $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Approximately $3.6 million of this was primarily attributable to the addition of key personnel to facilitate the management of our business and $1.1 million was attributable to certain commercial activities.

The dividend is for holders of the Company’s common stock.","Americold Realty Trust, Inc. Declares First Quarter 2024 Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends earnings Rhea-AI Summary Americold Realty Trust (COLD) declares a dividend of $0.22 per share for the first quarter of 2024, payable on April 15, 2024. The dividend is for holders of the Company’s common stock. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a dividend of $0.22 per share by Americold Realty Trust is a significant indicator of the company's current financial health and its ability to generate cash flow. Dividends are a portion of earnings that a company returns to shareholders and they can provide insights into the company's profitability and its board's confidence in sustained earnings. The fact that Americold is able to pay out dividends may suggest that it has a stable and reliable revenue stream, which is particularly important for real estate investment trusts (REITs) that are expected to pay out a majority of their income as dividends.Investors typically view regular dividends as a sign of a company's stability and maturity and they can be particularly attractive to income-focused investors. The impact on the stock market can be multifaceted; a stable or increasing dividend can lead to a positive investor sentiment, potentially boosting the stock price. Conversely, if the market expected a higher dividend and the company underdelivered, the stock price could be negatively affected. It's also worth noting that the ex-dividend date, which is the cutoff date to be eligible for the dividend payment, can influence the stock's trading volume and price volatility in the short term. Market Research Analyst From a market research perspective, the announcement of Americold Realty Trust's dividend payout needs to be contextualized within the broader industry trends. The temperature-controlled logistics sector has been experiencing increased demand due to the rise in online grocery sales and the need for efficient cold chain solutions. This uptick in demand could be contributing to Americold's ability to maintain or possibly increase its dividend payouts.Examining the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the stock price, is essential to understand how Americold's dividend compares to its peers and the broader market. A higher than average yield can be attractive to investors, but it can also signal that the stock price has fallen, possibly due to underlying issues within the company. Therefore, it's crucial to analyze the dividend in conjunction with the company's overall performance, including revenue growth, occupancy rates in their warehouses and operational efficiency. Real Estate Investment Analyst For an investor focusing on real estate, Americold Realty Trust's dividend announcement is a key piece of data. REITs like Americold are required by law to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders, making their dividend patterns particularly important to evaluate. The consistency and size of the dividend payments can be indicative of the company's portfolio strength, management effectiveness and strategic positioning within the temperature-controlled warehouse sector.Investors would also be interested in the occupancy rates and lease durations of Americold's properties, as these factors directly impact revenue stability. Additionally, the development and acquisition activities of the company could influence future dividends. If Americold is actively expanding its portfolio with accretive acquisitions or developments, it could lead to increased rental income and, subsequently, higher dividends in the long term. However, these activities also require capital and the balance between growth investments and dividend payouts is a delicate one that management must navigate carefully. 03/07/2024 - 04:05 PM ATLANTA, GA, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Americold Realty Trust (NYSE: COLD), a global leader in temperature-controlled logistics, real estate, and value-added services focused on the ownership, operation, acquisition and development of temperature-controlled warehouses, today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $0.22 per share for the first quarter of 2024, payable to holders of the Company’s common stock. The dividend will be payable in cash on April 15, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 28, 2024. About Americold Realty Trust, Inc.

Positive guidance provided for the upcoming quarter and fiscal year, indicating strong revenue and margin expectations. Negative None. Financial Analyst DocuSign's reported increase in total revenue and subscription revenue by 8% and 10% respectively year-over-year, alongside a significant improvement in free cash flow, reflects a solid financial performance in a competitive SaaS market. The reported GAAP net income per share from a loss in the previous fiscal year to a gain indicates effective cost management and possibly improved operational efficiency. However, the slight dip in non-GAAP gross margin year-over-year may warrant attention as it could suggest increased costs relative to revenue, which might impact profitability if the trend continues.The repayment of the 2024 convertible senior notes is a positive move, reducing future interest expenses and potential dilution of shares. This action should be viewed favorably by investors as it indicates a strong liquidity position and prudent financial management. The provided outlook for the upcoming quarter and fiscal year suggests confidence in the company's growth trajectory, although the guidance for non-GAAP operating margin shows a potential decrease, which could be a point of concern for margin sustainability in the long-term. Market Research Analyst DocuSign's momentum in product innovation, as emphasized by the CEO, is critical in maintaining its market leader status in e-signature solutions. The introduction of features like the Identity Wallet for QES and the modernized DocuSign CLM search experience are likely to enhance user experience and could increase customer retention and acquisition. The StateRAMP Authorization is particularly noteworthy as it opens up government sectors at various levels, which are often characterized by high entry barriers but offer substantial, stable long-term contracts.The company's focus on improving the agreement management process using AI and other advanced technologies is in line with industry trends towards digital transformation and automation. This strategic direction not only aligns with the increasing demand for efficient remote work solutions post-pandemic but also positions DocuSign to capitalize on the broader digital document management market, potentially expanding its revenue base beyond its core e-signature offerings. Legal Expert The advancements in DocuSign's product offerings, such as the Identity Wallet for QES, are significant from a legal perspective. They address the growing need for secure and legally compliant digital transactions, which is becoming increasingly important as businesses continue to operate in a global and digital environment.

Stock-based compensation-related charges, including employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions, are impacted by many factors, including the timing of employee stock transactions, the future fair market value of our common stock, and our future hiring and retention needs, all of which are difficult to predict and subject to constant change. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in the financial statement tables for our historical non-GAAP financial results included in this release.

We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this press release or to conform such statements to actual results or revised expectations, except as required by law. Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Metrics To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, as described below, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors' overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our financial performance, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by our management for financial and operational decision-making. We present these non-GAAP measures to assist investors in seeing our financial performance using a management view, and because we believe that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry. However, these non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results. Non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share: We define these non-GAAP financial measures as the respective GAAP measures, excluding expenses related to stock-based compensation, employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, fair value adjustments to strategic investments, executive transition costs, lease-related impairment and lease-related charges, restructuring and other related charges, as these costs are not reflective of ongoing operations and, as applicable, other special items. The amount of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions is dependent on our stock price and other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of the business. When evaluating the performance of our business and making operating plans, we do not consider these items (for example, when considering the impact of equity award grants, we place a greater emphasis on overall stockholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with such grants). We believe it is useful to exclude these expenses in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies and over multiple periods. In addition to these exclusions, we subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to calculate non-GAAP net income. We utilize a fixed long-term projected tax rate in our computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across the reporting periods. For fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, we have determined the projected non-GAAP tax rate to be 20%. Free cash flow: We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available (if any), after purchases of property and equipment, for operational expenses, investment in our business, and to make acquisitions. Free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures our ability to generate or use cash in excess of our capital investments in property and equipment. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet and invest in future growth. Billings: We define billings as total revenues plus the change in our contract liabilities and refund liability less contract assets and unbilled accounts receivable in a given period. Billings reflects sales to new customers plus subscription renewals and additional sales to existing customers. Only amounts invoiced to a customer in a given period are included in billings. We believe billings can be used to measure our periodic performance, when taking into consideration the timing aspects of customer renewals, which represents a large component of our business. Given that most of our customers pay in annual installments one year in advance, but we typically recognize a majority of the related revenue ratably over time, we use billings to measure and monitor our ability to provide our business with the working capital generated by upfront payments from our customers. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see ""Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below.

Successful execution of a public offering generating $63.2 million in gross proceeds. Anticipation of significant clinical milestones in 2024 across different cancer types. Strong financial position with $218.1 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2023. Negative Increase in R&D expenses for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior-year periods. GAAP net loss of $45.5 million for Q4 2023 and $160.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Non-GAAP net loss of $38.7 million for Q4 2023 and $134.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from ALX Oncology Holdings Inc. indicate a significant increase in R&D expenses, which rose from $98.4 million in the prior year to $141.8 million. This uptick reflects the company's aggressive investment in expanding clinical trials and manufacturing of clinical trial materials for its lead product candidate, evorpacept. Notably, the company's cash position of $218.1 million, bolstered by a successful public offering that generated approximately $63.2 million, suggests a robust cash runway into early 2026. This financial cushion may reassure investors about the company's ability to sustain operations and continue its research without the immediate need for additional capital.However, the widening GAAP net loss from $123.5 million to $160.8 million year-over-year raises concerns about the company's profitability trajectory. As ALX Oncology is still in the clinical stage of development, such losses are not uncommon, but they do emphasize the importance of the company's pipeline success. The positive interim results from the ASPEN-06 Phase 2 trial could be a pivotal factor in the company's future, potentially leading to increased investor confidence if the full data continues to demonstrate significant efficacy and safety. Medical Research Analyst The interim analysis of the ASPEN-06 Phase 2 clinical trial in advanced HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer reveals a notable overall response rate of 52 percent for the evorpacept combination treatment arm, which is a substantial improvement over the 22 percent for the control group. This finding is particularly compelling when compared to the benchmark ORR of 28 percent and mDOR of 4.4 months from the RAINBOW study, underscoring evorpacept's potential as a significant advancement in the treatment of this cancer type.The safety profile consistency with prior trials adds to the compound's credibility, an essential consideration for both clinicians and investors. The anticipation of multiple data readouts over the next 12-18 months across various cancer types positions the company at the forefront of the CD47 immune checkpoint pathway, a promising target in immuno-oncology. The success of evorpacept could have profound implications for patients with limited treatment options and could significantly alter the competitive landscape in oncology therapeutics. Market Research Analyst The strategic execution of an oversubscribed public offering following positive clinical trial results is indicative of ALX Oncology's market acumen. By capitalizing on the positive news, the company has effectively extended its financial runway, which may reduce the risk profile for current and potential investors. The timing of this offering, in conjunction with the detailed timeline for forthcoming clinical milestones, suggests a well-orchestrated effort to maintain investor interest and market momentum.Market response to the interim analysis and subsequent financing activities will likely be contingent on the continued success of evorpacept in ongoing and future trials. The initiation of a Phase 3 registrational trial, a critical step towards potential commercialization, could serve as a significant catalyst for the company's valuation and stock performance. The market will closely monitor the upcoming data presentations at the AACR Annual Meeting and subsequent trial results to gauge the commercial viability of evorpacept and its potential impact on ALX Oncology's market position. 03/07/2024 - 04:03 PM SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ALX Oncology Holdings Inc., (“ALX Oncology” or “the Company”) (Nasdaq: ALXO), an immuno-oncology company developing therapies that block the CD47 immune checkpoint pathway, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a corporate update. “This past year proved to be a profound growth period for ALX Oncology highlighted by evorpacept’s positive results in the prespecified randomized interim analysis of the ASPEN-06 Phase 2 clinical trial in advanced HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer,” said Jason Lettmann, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of ALX Oncology. “Notably, this outcome is particularly important as it represents the first promising activity in a randomized trial in solid tumors in the CD47 space and further underscores evorpacept’s differentiation. Over the next 12-18 months, we expect to report multiple value inflection datapoints, with the goal of advancing evorpacept’s potential beyond anti-cancer antibodies through ongoing combination studies with ADCs and checkpoint inhibitors. With nine ongoing trials, our goal is to expand evorpacept’s value to other tumor types including breast, NHL, multiple myeloma and urothelial cancers as well as accelerate our efforts to identify new indications around this highly differentiated asset.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights Appointed long-standing board member, Jason Lettmann to CEO, while co-founder and previous CEO, Jaume Pons, Ph.D., transitioned to Chief Scientific Officer in September.Reported positive results from a prespecified interim analysis of the Phase 2 randomized multi-center international clinical trial of ASPEN-06 for the treatment of advanced HER2-positive gastric/gastroesophageal junction (“GEJ”) cancer in October. Key findings from the 54 randomized subjects, which included those previously treated with ENHERTU® (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) and/or immune checkpoint inhibitors, reported a confirmed overall response rate (“ORR”) of 52 percent in the evorpacept combination treatment arm compared to 22 percent for the control group of trastuzumab + CYRAMZA® (ramucirumab) + paclitaxel (“TRP”).Median duration of response (“mDOR”) was not reached for the evorpacept TRP combination treatment arm compared to 7.4 months for the control group of TRP.The safety profile of evorpacept was consistent with the Company’s previous clinical trials and remained well-tolerated in this reported treatment combination.The interim results compared favorably to the efficacy results reported for CYRAMZA + paclitaxel in the RAINBOW study (ORR of 28 percent and mDOR of 4.4 months), which currently serves as the regulatory benchmark and global standard-of-care for second-line gastric/GEJ cancer. Executed an oversubscribed underwritten public offering that generated gross proceeds of approximately $63.2 million during October, which helps to extend the Company’s expected cash runway into early 2026. The follow-on offering closely followed the report of the positive interim analysis of the Phase 2 ASPEN-06 clinical trial in advanced HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancer. ALX Oncology sold 8,663,793 shares of common stock, which included 1,293,103 shares of common stock pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares and, in lieu of common stock to certain investors, pre-funded warrants to purchase 1,250,000 shares of common stock in the offering. The shares of common stock were sold at a public offering price of $6.38 per share (the closing price on October 4, 2023), and the pre-funded warrants were sold at a public offering price of $6.379 per pre-funded warrant. Anticipated 2024 Clinical Milestones for Evorpacept’s Maturing Pipeline Development Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma – Data from a Phase 1b IST with rituximab + lenalidomide will be presented in an oral presentation in a Clinical Trials Minisymposium session at the AACR Annual Meeting 2024 on Tuesday, April 9, 2024, from 2:30 pm – 4:30 pm PT.Urothelial Carcinoma – Data from a Phase 1b ASPEN-07 clinical trial with PADCEV® (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) (Q2 2024)Gastric/GEJ Cancer – Top line results from all 122 subjects in a Phase 2 randomized clinical trial of ASPEN-06 (June-July 2024)Breast Cancer – Top line results from a Phase 1b I-SPY TRIAL with ENHERTU (Q4 2024)Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma – Top line results from a Phase 2 randomized clinical trial of ASPEN-03 with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) (Q4 2024/Q1 2025)Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma – Top line results from a Phase 2 randomized clinical trial of ASPEN-04 with KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy (Q4 2024/Q1 2025)Gastric/GEJ Cancer – Initiation of Phase 3 registrational randomized clinical trial for evorpacept (Q4 2024) 2023 Full Year and Fourth Quarter Financial Results: Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments: Cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2023, were $218.1 million. The Company believes its cash, cash equivalents, and investments along with the ability to draw down an additional $40 million of its term loan are sufficient to fund planned operations into early 2026.Research and Development (“R&D”) Expenses: R&D expenses consist primarily of pre-clinical, clinical and manufacturing expenses related to the development of the Company’s current lead product candidate, evorpacept, and R&D employee-related expenses. These expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023, were $41.8 million, compared to $25.2 million for the prior-year period. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $13.6 million in clinical costs from an increase in the number of active trials and patient enrollment as well as manufacturing of clinical trial materials to support a higher number of active clinical trials and future expected patient enrollment related to the advancement of evorpacept. R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $141.8 million, compared to $98.4 million for the prior-year period.General and Administrative (“G&A”) Expenses: G&A expenses consist primarily of administrative employee-related expenses, legal and other professional fees, patent filing and maintenance fees, and insurance.

G&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $28.5 million, compared to $29.0 million for the prior-year period.Net loss: GAAP net loss was $45.5 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023, or ($0.93) per basic and diluted share, as compared to a GAAP net loss of $30.7 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022, or ($0.75) per basic and diluted share. GAAP net loss was $160.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, or ($3.74) per basic and diluted share, as compared to a GAAP net loss of $123.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, or ($3.03) per basic and diluted share. Non-GAAP net loss was $38.7 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023, as compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $24.4 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022.

To date, evorpacept has been dosed in over 500 subjects and has demonstrated promising activity and a favorable tolerability profile across a range of hematologic and solid malignancies in combination with various leading anti-cancer antibodies. ALX Oncology is currently focusing on combining evorpacept with anti-cancer antibodies, ADCs, and PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors. Evorpacept’s Unique Profile: Anchored by a Rational Design and Dual Development Pillars Rationally engineered with an inactive Fc effector function, evorpacept’s clinical data to date has demonstrated a substantially improved safety profile over other anti-CD47 molecules in the clinic with an active Fc (i.e., binding the Fc gamma receptor on macrophages). This best-in-class safety profile allows for higher dosage with minimal overlapping toxicity in the combination treatment setting. CD47 expressed on cancer cells binds to its receptor SIRP alpha, which is predominantly expressed on two cell types: macrophages and dendritic cells. The Company’s pipeline of therapeutic candidates with standard-of-care agents include: Anti-cancer antibodies (the “don’t eat me” signal): evorpacept enables Fc-mediated antibody-dependent phagocytosis by macrophages in combination with anti-cancer antibodies (e.g., Herceptin®) with an active Fc domain, which is otherwise impaired by CD47 expression on cancer cells binding to SIRP alpha on macrophages. This same mechanism of action applies to ADCs.PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (the “don’t activate T-cells” signal): evorpacept enables T-cell activation by dendritic cells that are constitutively inhibited by CD47 expression on cancer cells binding to SIRP alpha on dendritic cells. Activated dendritic cells present neoantigens to T-cells that once activated will kill cancer cells when the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory interaction is blocked by T-cell checkpoint inhibitors.

Negative None. 03/07/2024 - 04:01 PM Calgary, Alberta--(Newsfile Corp. - March 7, 2024) - Hemostemix Inc. (TSXV: HEM) (OTCQB: HMTXF) (FSE: 2VF0) (""Hemostemix"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce the non-exclusive engagement of Oak Hill Asset Management Inc. (""OHAM""), an Exempt Market Dealer to provide capital markets advice related to the Company's capital markets strategy. Services include advice on the structure of equity or debt capital financing and the identification of potential future investors. The Company intends to raise approximately C$6 million in low-dilution capital (the ""Offering""). Proceeds will be used to re-establish production of ACP-01 for sale as an exempt compassionate treatment and to complete its phase III CLTI clinical trial. Pursuant to an engagement letter between the Company and OHAM, the Company has agreed to pay OHAM a cash fee of $12,000 plus $20,000 in common shares as a work fee. Additional fees would be paid on any financing raised by OHAM. Proceeds from the Offering will allow the Company to lease ready-to-occupy cGMP production capacity in Puerto Rico in 2024 and generate revenue by the end of 2025 through 30-40 exempt compassionate treatments per month, while scaling production and progressing its clinical trial. ​Sales of ACP for CLTI treatments will be through clinical trial sites (to patients who do not meet inclusion criteria), through limb salvage clinics and podiatrists. To-date, seven clinical trial sites have agreed to refer patients to Hemostemix for exempt compassionate treatments; and, have agreed to process up to 226 of Hemostemix's referrals to them per month. Puerto Rico's Act 60 legislation enables the company to obtain 50% cash back on eligible expenses including clinical trials. Additionally, ACT 60 provides the company with a 15-year 1% profit tax structure, and a 20% tax credit for offshore expenses.​The structure and price of the Offering has yet to be determined and the Company will issue a follow-up news release once details are available. The Company is confident that it can be completed on a low-dilutive basis that appropriately values the significant, near-term revenue and cash flow streams.""The 498 treatments of ACP, including the seven clinical studies published in peer reviewed journals to-date, demonstrate ACP is safe and effective in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease and three forms of heart disease,"" stated Thomas Smeenk, CEO. ""It is remarkable that the clinical trial sites will be able to refer and see up to 226 no-option referrals. Compared to no-option and amputation, an ACP injection under exemption to save the limb makes sense,"" Smeenk said.ABOUT HEMOSTEMIXHemostemix is an autologous stem cell therapy company, founded in 2003.

Kostaive® set to launch in Japan, ARCT-032 and ARCT-810 on track for Phase 1b and Phase 2 interim data respectively. New STARR® vaccine discovery programs initiated for Lyme Disease and Gonorrhea. Cash runway extended to Q1 2027. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The anticipated launch of Kostaive® in Japan could represent a significant milestone for Arcturus Therapeutics, potentially opening up a new market and revenue stream. Japan is known for its rigorous regulatory environment and a successful launch there could enhance the company's reputation and credibility. The extension of the cash runway to Q1 2027 is also noteworthy, as it suggests that the company has secured enough capital to sustain its operations and research for an extended period. This financial stability might be seen positively by investors, as it reduces the immediate risk of dilutive fundraising. Medical Research Analyst The progression of ARCT-032, ARCT-810 and ARCT-2138 through clinical trials is critical for Arcturus' pipeline. The interim data expected in Q2 for ARCT-032 and ARCT-810 will be pivotal in determining the future of these candidates. Positive data could lead to an increase in stock value due to heightened investor confidence. The initiation of the Phase 1 study for the Quadrivalent LUNAR-FLU vaccine also indicates the company's commitment to expanding its infectious disease portfolio. The new STARR® vaccine discovery programs for Lyme Disease and Gonorrhea show that Arcturus is diversifying its research, which could mitigate risks associated with its current pipeline and offer additional growth avenues. Market Research Analyst The global messenger RNA (mRNA) medicines market has gained significant attention, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Arcturus' focus on mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases places it within a competitive and fast-evolving industry. Its strategic initiatives, such as the expansion into vaccines for Lyme Disease and Gonorrhea, are likely to be closely watched by competitors and investors alike. The company's ability to extend its cash runway and progress its clinical programs may be interpreted as signs of operational efficiency and effective strategic planning. However, it's important to remain cautious and consider the high level of competition and the scientific and regulatory challenges inherent in vaccine development. 03/07/2024 - 04:01 PM Kostaive® anticipated to launch in Japan this year ARCT-032 remains on track for Phase 1b interim data in Q2 ARCT-810 remains on track for Phase 2 interim data by the end of Q2 ARCT-2138 (Quadrivalent LUNAR-FLU) Phase 1 study for seasonal influenza vaccine initiated New STARR® vaccine discovery programs initiated for Lyme Disease and Gonorrhea Cash runway extended to Q1 2027 Investor conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET today SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc. (the “Company”, “Arcturus”, Nasdaq: ARCT), a global messenger RNA medicines company focused on the development of infectious disease vaccines and opportunities within liver and respiratory rare diseases, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023, and provided corporate updates. “I am excited about the continued pipeline progress and efforts toward commercialization achieved by Arcturus in 2023,” said Joseph Payne, President & CEO of Arcturus Therapeutics. “Alongside our global vaccine partner CSL Seqirus and their COVID vaccine partner in Japan, Meiji, Kostaive® was granted historic approval as the world’s first self-amplifying mRNA (sa-mRNA) product. Recently released clinical trial data, demonstrated Kostaive® induced a stronger, broader, and more durable immune response compared to an approved conventional mRNA vaccine.” Mr. Payne continued: “We are especially pleased to announce the U.S. FDA and the European Commission recently granted Orphan Drug Designation for ARCT-032, an inhaled mRNA therapeutic candidate for individuals with cystic fibrosis. These regulatory designations will help advance ARCT-032 to become a potential treatment for the segment of the CF population who are not candidates for any of the currently approved drugs for this disease.” Andy Sassine, Chief Financial Officer of Arcturus said, “I am pleased to announce the cash runway was extended to the first quarter 2027 due to disciplined cost management and progression of the CSL collaboration. This is the second sequential quarter our runway was extended without including any contributions from Kostaive® revenues or commercial milestones.” Recent Corporate Highlights In February 2024, the Company announced new COVID-19 sa-mRNA results in collaboration with CSL, demonstrating a longer duration of immunity compared to conventional COVID-19 mRNA vaccine booster. Short communication follows previously published data in The Lancet Infectious Diseases in December 2023. The randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study, conducted at 11 sites in Japan assessed the immunogenicity of Kostaive® and Comirnaty® at one, three- and six-months post-booster. The new analysis extends the time of observation of immune response from 3 months to 6 months post booster dose, demonstrating an advantage in antibody persistence of Kostaive® over Comirnaty against both the original Wuhan strain and the Omicron BA.4/5 variant. The superior immune response of Kostaive® in terms of magnitude and duration of antibody persistence was achieved with one sixth the dose of Comirnaty (5 μg vs 30 μg). In November, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) granted approval for Kostaive®, a self-amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for primary vaccination and booster for adults 18 years and older. This marks the first marketing approval milestone for CSL and Arcturus since signing the Collaboration and License agreement in November 2022. The approval is based on positive clinical data from several Kostaive® studies, including a 16,000 subject efficacy study performed in Vietnam as well as a Phase 3 COVID-19 booster trial, which achieved higher immunogenicity results and a favorable safety profile compared to a standard mRNA COVID-19 vaccine comparator. The study results have been published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. Kostaive® is anticipated to launch in Japan this year. In January 2024, the Company, under its collaboration with CSL, initiated a Phase 1 dose-finding study for ARCT-2138 (Quadrivalent LUNAR-FLU) seasonal influenza vaccine in healthy young and older adults. The Company continues to advance the development of ARCT-810, an mRNA therapeutic candidate for ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. ARCT-810 Phase 1b single ascending dose study in the U.S. has completed enrollment and dosing of all cohorts (N = 16 patients). ARCT-810 Phase 2 study in UK and Europe is enrolling up to 24 adolescents and adults with OTC deficiency. The ongoing study is evaluating two dose levels and includes up to six (6) bi-weekly administrations for each participant. The Company expects to share Phase 2 interim data by the end of Q2. In November 2023, Arcturus received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. FDA for ARCT-032, for the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis. In February 2024, Arcturus was granted Orphan Medicinal Product Designation from the European Commission for ARCT-032. ARCT-032 remains on track for Phase 1b interim data in Q2 2024. Based on the clinical and regulatory validation of LUNAR® and STARR® technologies provided by the approval of Kostaive® in Japan, the Company has initiated new vaccine discovery programs for Lyme Disease and Gonorrhea. Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2023 Revenues in conjunction with collaborations and grants: Arcturus’ primary sources of revenues were from license fees, consulting and related technology transfer fees, reservation fees and collaborative payments received from research and development arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we reported revenue of $169.9 million compared with $206.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Revenue recognized from CSL in 2023 was $157.4 million which slightly increased by $3.0 million compared to 2022. We made significant progress with the BARDA grant agreement that led to an increase in revenue of $8.8 million. The majority of the annual decrease in revenue was driven by the discontinuation of our collaboration agreements with Vinbiocare and Janssen. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, revenue recognized was $34.0 million compared with $160.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The $200.0 million up front payment for the execution of the CSL collaboration drove the majority of the revenue recognition during the three months ended December 31, 2022. Operating expenses: Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $245.0 million compared with $193.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, operating expenses were $49.1 million compared with $38.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses consist primarily of external manufacturing costs, in-vivo research studies and clinical trials performed by contract research organizations, clinical and regulatory consultants, personnel related expenses, facility related expenses and laboratory supplies. Research and development expenses were $192.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared with $147.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in research and development expenses were primarily driven by the CSL and BARDA programs as well as our internal OTC and Cystic Fibrosis programs. Additionally, we have increased investments in early stage and discovery technologies. The Company initiated preclinical research related to its Lyme Disease and Gonorrhea vaccine discovery programs. Research and development expenses were $36.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared with $27.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. This increase was due to higher professional and personnel-related expenses as well as lower contra research and development expense from grants. General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries and related benefits for our executive, administrative, legal and accounting functions and professional service fees for legal and accounting services as well as other general and administrative expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2023, general and administrative expenses were $52.9 million compared with $46.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The annual increase was primarily due to personnel expenses as a result of increased headcount and salaries, travel and consulting expenses. Additionally, we incurred higher rent expenses associated with the new headquarters facility.

Negative Net loss of ($8.2) million in fiscal year 2023 compared to a net loss of ($1.0) million in fiscal year 2022. Decrease in gross margin in fiscal year 2023 primarily due to higher outbound transportation costs and a shift in product mix. Reduction of 150 global roles due to a slow start in 2024 and a challenging macro environment. Financial Analyst Reviewing CarParts.com's fiscal year 2023 financial results, several key metrics stand out. The company achieved a modest sales growth of 2%, which indicates a stable demand for their products despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. However, the slight decrease in gross profit and a wider net loss compared to the previous year suggest margin pressures, primarily due to increased outbound transportation costs and a shift in product mix. This could be indicative of rising operational challenges or changes in consumer purchasing behavior, potentially impacting profitability.Adjusted EBITDA, a measure of a company's operating performance, saw a decrease from $26.1 million to $19.7 million year-over-year. This decline is concerning as it reflects a drop in earnings quality and may signal underlying issues in cost management or operational efficiency. Investors might view this as a red flag, particularly if the trend continues.The share repurchase activity demonstrates management's confidence in the intrinsic value of the company and the strong balance sheet with ample cash reserves and no long-term debt provides financial flexibility. However, the forecast for flat to minimal sales growth in 2024, alongside the expected decrease in gross margin, suggests that CarParts.com may face continued headwinds in the near term. Market Research Analyst The automotive aftermarket is a $389 billion industry with significant growth potential, especially in the e-commerce segment. CarParts.com's reported unit growth and claim of taking market share from competitors is a positive sign, indicating effective strategies to capture consumer demand. However, the reduction of 150 global roles points to a strategic pivot towards cost optimization. This could be a response to the 'difficult macro environment' mentioned by the CEO, possibly alluding to economic downturns, supply chain issues, or increased competition.Investors should consider the long-term implications of the company's cost-cutting measures. While they may lead to short-term financial stability, they could also impact the company's ability to innovate and scale, which are crucial for maintaining a competitive edge in the e-commerce space. The automotive parts industry is highly competitive and a balance between cost management and investment in growth is essential for sustainable success. Economist The automotive aftermarket sector is generally resilient to economic downturns as consumers opt to maintain and repair existing vehicles instead of purchasing new ones. However, the company's slow start to 2024 and the reference to a challenging macro environment may suggest broader economic factors at play, such as inflationary pressures or a potential economic slowdown, which could dampen consumer spending and affect sales.Despite these challenges, CarParts.com's position with no revolver debt is a strong indicator of financial health, which can be particularly advantageous in a tightening credit market. The company's ability to maintain a strong cash position and an undrawn credit facility provides a buffer against unforeseen financial strains. This conservative financial posture can be reassuring to investors, especially during periods of economic uncertainty. 03/07/2024 - 04:01 PM Record Fiscal Year Sales of $676 million TORRANCE, Calif., March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- CarParts.com, Inc.

We believe we are taking share from other online players and as consumer confidence rebounds, we are well positioned to support the $389 billion automotive aftermarket and deliver long-term growth."" said David Meniane, CEO. ""In fiscal year 2023, our team surpassed several company records and reached significant achievements. However, we experienced a slow start to 2024 and we continue to experience a difficult macro environment. In light of these challenges, we have made the tough decision to significantly reduce our cost structure including the elimination of 150 global roles. These decisions are not made lightly but we want to stay agile, protect shareholder value, and realign to the reality of the environment. We continue to believe the strategic priorities and areas of the business we are focused on will lead to long-term shareholder value. We have proven in the past that we can grow and execute change management through difficult environments and now is no different. In addition, we are supported by the strength of our balance sheet with ample cash and inventory as well as an undrawn facility with no long-term debt.""

Gross profit decreased slightly to $229.4 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to $230.9 million in fiscal year 2022. Gross margin decreased 100 basis points to 33.9% in fiscal year 2023 compared to 34.9% in fiscal year 2022. The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by higher outbound transportation costs and a shift in product mix. Total operating expenses in fiscal year 2023 were $239.3 million compared to $230.2 million in fiscal year 2022. The increase was primarily driven by investments in our business, combined with higher advertising expense, partially offset by a decrease in fulfillment expense primarily due to an improvement in distribution center fulfillment costs. Net loss in fiscal year 2023 was ($8.2) million compared to a net loss of ($1.0) million in fiscal year 2022. Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal year 2023 was $19.7 million compared to $26.1 million in the fiscal year 2022. On December 30, 2023, the Company had a cash balance of $51.0 million and no revolver debt, compared to no revolver debt and a $18.8 million cash balance at prior fiscal year-end December 31, 2022. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $156.4 million, up 1% from the year-ago quarter. Gross profit in the fourth quarter remained flat at $51.6 million, with gross margin decreasing 40 basis points to 33.0%. The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by higher outbound transportation costs and a shift in product mix. Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $58.4 million compared to $57.1 million in the year-ago. Net loss in the fourth quarter was ($6.1) million compared to a net loss of ($6.2) million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $1.0 million compared to $2.1 million in the year-ago quarter. 2024 Outlook For the full year, the Company expects comparable net sales in a range from negative two percent to positive two percent.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, and other provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. We provide ""Adjusted EBITDA"" in this earnings release and on today's scheduled conference call, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA consist of net loss before (a) interest (income) expense, net; (b) income tax (benefit) provision; (c) depreciation and amortization expense; (d) amortization of intangible assets; and (e) share-based compensation expense. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss is provided below. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide important supplemental information to management and investors. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company's business and results of operations. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as measures of the Company's operating performance because it assists in comparing the Company's operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of stock compensation expense as well as other items that we do not believe are representative of our ongoing operating performance. Internally, these non-GAAP measures are also used by management for planning purposes, including the preparation of internal budgets; for allocating resources to enhance financial performance; and for evaluating the effectiveness of operational strategies. The Company also believes that analysts and investors use these non-GAAP measures as supplemental measures to evaluate the ongoing operations of companies in our industry. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Management strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. In addition, the Company expects to continue to incur expenses similar to the non-GAAP adjustments described above, and exclusion of these items from the Company's non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are all unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Safe Harbor Statement This press release contains statements which are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company's business and its industry, as well as certain assumptions made by the Company. These statements are forward looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provided by Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Words such as ""anticipates,"" ""could,"" ""expects,"" ""intends,"" ""plans,"" ""potential,"" ""believes,"" ""predicts,"" ""projects,"" ""seeks,"" ""estimates,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""would,"" ""will likely continue"" and variations of these words or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future operating results and financial condition, our potential growth, our ability to innovate, our ability to gain market share, and our ability to expand and improve our product offerings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Important factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, competitive pressures, our dependence on search engines to attract customers, demand for the Company's products, the online market and channel mix for aftermarket auto parts, the economy in general, increases in commodity and component pricing that would increase the Company's product costs, the operating restrictions in its credit agreement, the weather and any other factors discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""), including the Risk Factors contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10–K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10–Q, which are available at www.carparts.com/investor and the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

The contract spans over a 10-year period and involves a joint venture with BWX Technologies, Inc. and Amentum. Fluor will use the equity method of accounting for earnings recognition. Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Management Expert The selection of Hanford Tank Waste Operations & Closure, LLC (H2C) for the Hanford Integrated Tank Disposition Contract represents a significant commitment by the Department of Energy (DOE) towards addressing the environmental legacy of plutonium production at the Hanford Site. The contract's ceiling of $45 billion over a 10-year period underscores the scale and complexity of the cleanup efforts required. It is essential to consider the environmental technologies and methodologies that will be employed to manage and treat the tank waste effectively. The implications for environmental remediation firms are considerable, as this contract may set precedence for future federal cleanup projects and methodologies.Furthermore, the involvement of companies like Fluor Corporation in such large-scale projects can have a substantial impact on their financial health and stock valuation. The use of the equity method of accounting to recognize earnings suggests that Fluor has a significant, but not controlling, interest in the joint venture. This accounting method could lead to fluctuations in reported income, depending on the performance of the joint venture, which in turn may affect investor perceptions and the company's market value. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the Hanford contract could be a catalyst for growth for the involved companies. The recognition of earnings through the equity method indicates that Fluor's financial statements will reflect its proportional share of the joint venture's profits or losses. This can lead to increased earnings visibility and potentially improve investor confidence if the project progresses well. However, it also exposes Fluor to risks associated with the joint venture's performance, which could impact future earnings reports.Investors will likely monitor the progress of the project closely, as the scale of the contract could contribute significantly to the revenue streams of the companies involved. The long-term nature of the contract provides a degree of financial stability, but also requires careful management of project costs and risks over an extended period. The contract's impact on the stock market will depend on the execution of the project and the financial performance of the companies involved. Risk Management Specialist Managing the risks associated with a project of this magnitude is critical. The Hanford Site cleanup involves handling hazardous materials and operating in a highly regulated environment. Ensuring safety and compliance with environmental regulations is paramount. Any lapses could lead to costly delays, legal liabilities, or reputational damage. Companies involved must have robust risk management frameworks in place to mitigate these potential issues.Additionally, the joint venture structure can introduce complexities in decision-making and accountability. With multiple companies involved, aligning objectives and managing shared risks is essential. The long-term success of the project will hinge on the joint venture's ability to manage these risks effectively, which will be closely watched by stakeholders and could influence the market's perception of the companies' risk profiles. 03/07/2024 - 04:01 PM IRVING, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR) announced today that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) selected Hanford Tank Waste Operations & Closure, LLC (H2C) – a joint venture led by a subsidiary of BWX Technologies, Inc., together with Fluor and Amentum – to execute the Hanford Integrated Tank Disposition Contract.

Alpha Tau Medical Announces Full Year 2023 Financial Results and Provides Corporate Update,2024-03-07T21:01:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Alpha Tau Medical Ltd. reported positive interim safety and feasibility data from a pancreatic cancer study in Montreal, entered a pivotal U.S. trial, submitted a PMDA application in Japan, and expanded its U.S. facility. The company has a strong financial position with $84.9 million in cash, providing a runway for at least two years.","Alpha Tau Medical Announces Full Year 2023 Financial Results and Provides Corporate Update Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Alpha Tau Medical Ltd. reported positive interim safety and feasibility data from a pancreatic cancer study in Montreal, entered a pivotal U.S. trial, submitted a PMDA application in Japan, and expanded its U.S. facility. The company has a strong financial position with $84.9 million in cash, providing a runway for at least two years. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Alpha Tau Medical Ltd. indicate a net loss reduction from $33.8 million in 2022 to $29.2 million in 2023, which may be seen by investors as a positive trajectory in terms of narrowing losses. This is coupled with a cash balance of $84.9 million, which the company anticipates will provide a runway for at least two years. Considering the increased R&D expenses, which rose from $20.9 million to $26.4 million, stakeholders should note the company’s commitment to advancing its clinical trials. The rise in R&D is reflective of the company's strategic investments in the ReSTART trial and its expansion of clinical trials, which could potentially lead to future revenue streams upon successful product commercialization.However, the increase in marketing expenses, although relatively small, signals the company's efforts to prepare for commercialization, which is crucial for future revenue generation. The decrease in G&A expenses from $10.3 million to $7.3 million demonstrates improved cost management. Additionally, the net financial income of $(6.5) million, a change from a net expense in the previous year, largely driven by revaluation of warrants and interest from bank deposits, contributes positively to the company's financial position.Investors should consider the implications of these financials in light of the company's clinical progress and strategic expansion, including the addition of manufacturing facilities, which could enhance production capacity in anticipation of product approval and market demand. Medical Research Analyst The interim safety and feasibility data from the pancreatic cancer study in Montreal and the progress in the ReSTART U.S. multi-center pivotal trial are critical developments for Alpha Tau Medical Ltd. The initial signs of dose response in the pancreatic cancer trial suggest that the Alpha DaRT therapy could be effective in treating this type of cancer, which typically has a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Stable disease responses and a partial response in patients are encouraging outcomes that could lead to significant interest from the medical community and potential for future FDA approval.The submission of a PMDA application in Japan for recurrent head and neck cancer represents a strategic move to enter the Asian market, potentially diversifying the company's revenue sources and mitigating geographic risk. The addition of Dr. Stephen Hahn to the Scientific Advisory Board may further bolster the company's credibility and expertise in the field of radiation oncology, potentially influencing the perception of the company's scientific rigor among investors and medical professionals.The long-term lease for a second manufacturing facility in the U.S. indicates forward-thinking in terms of production scalability. This is essential not only for meeting anticipated demand but also for mitigating risk associated with single-site production vulnerabilities. The milestones outlined for 2024, including the treatment of the first patients in liver metastases and recurrent lung cancer trials, showcase the company's aggressive pipeline development, which is an important factor for long-term growth and investor confidence. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Alpha Tau Medical Ltd.'s strategic initiatives, such as the expansion of its manufacturing footprint with a second facility in the U.S., suggest an anticipation of successful commercialization and market demand for its Alpha DaRT therapy. The company's focus on difficult-to-treat internal organ tumors with high unmet need represents a targeted approach to capture niche markets that may be underserved by current therapies.The company's projected two-year financial runway, supported by a substantial cash balance, provides it with a buffer to navigate the capital-intensive phase of clinical trials and regulatory approvals without immediate pressure to seek additional funding. This financial stability is crucial as it enters a pivotal phase of clinical development and potential market entry.Additionally, the company's international expansion efforts, as evidenced by the PMDA submission in Japan, reflect a strategic approach to market diversification. This move could potentially reduce reliance on any single market and provide a hedge against regional regulatory risks. The anticipation of a PMDA response by year-end 2024 will be a key milestone that may influence market sentiment and the company's valuation. 03/07/2024 - 04:01 PM - Positive interim safety and feasibility data from pancreatic cancer study in Montreal, with initial signs of potential dose response findings - - ReSTART U.S. multi-center pivotal trial currently underway - - Submitted PMDA application for recurrent Head and Neck cancer in Japan - - Entered into long-term lease for a second facility in the U.S. in Hudson, NH - - Cash, deposits and restricted deposits balance of $84.9 million, with anticipated runway for at least two years - JERUSALEM, March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alpha Tau Medical Ltd. (“Alpha Tau”, or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: DRTS, DRTSW), the developer of the innovative alpha-radiation cancer therapy Alpha DaRT™, reported full year 2023 financial results and provided a corporate update. “2023 was an incredibly productive year, as we launched our ReSTART pivotal U.S. multi-center trial in recurrent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, which is expected to complete recruitment in the second half of 2024, and as we initiated a number of feasibility trials in difficult-to-treat internal organ tumors with high unmet need,” stated Alpha Tau CEO Uzi Sofer. ""We saw meaningful inflection points delivered by the end of 2023, including strong interim safety and feasibility data from our pancreatic cancer trial in Montreal, with initial signs of dose response, and our PMDA submission in Japan for pre-market approval. In parallel, we continue to advance our commercial planning activities and to solidify our supply chain, which was recently bolstered by both a valuable land grant in Jerusalem that is expected to increase our future manufacturing capacity, as well as by the leasing of a second manufacturing site in the United States. In 2024, we are focused on completing patient recruitment in our U.S. pivotal ReSTART study and our pancreatic cancer pilot study in Canada, and on beginning to treat patients in studies targeting a number of other internal organs. We are also exploring the addition of new clinical trials in the U.S., based upon recent positive regulatory feedback. We expect to begin work on the construction of our second U.S. facility, in Hudson, NH, and on the construction plans for our second facility in Jerusalem. Alpha Tau expects to remain adequately capitalized to support all of these programs over the coming years.” Recent Corporate Highlights: In October, the Company announced that it had entered into a long-term lease agreement for a standalone building of over 14,000 rentable square feet in Hudson, NH, with the intention of erecting the Company’s second U.S. manufacturing site, alongside its first site in nearby Lawrence, MA.In October, the Company announced that Dr. Stephen Hahn, a former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and a distinguished expert in the field of radiation oncology and translational clinical research, joined its Scientific Advisory Board. In November, the Company announced that Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”) accepted Alpha Tau’s submission requesting shonin pre-market approval of Alpha DaRT in patients with recurrent head and neck cancer, following multiple pre-submission consultation meetings with the PMDA per common practice in Japan.In November, the Company announced interim results from treatment of the first five patients in the Company’s safety and feasibility trial in Montreal, Canada, examining the use of Alpha DaRT to treat advanced pancreatic cancer. The Alpha DaRT procedure was deemed technically successful in all five cases, with Alpha DaRT sources successfully inserted into the target tumors. There were no reported serious adverse events deemed related to the product, and the only reported adverse events deemed possibly related to the product were of severity grade 1 (mild). In addition, despite the conservative and gradual step-up of tumor coverage from minimal initial levels, three of the five patients demonstrated stable disease responses at four weeks after treatment, and one was upgraded to partial response at 69 days after treatment.

Financial results for the full year ended December 31, 2023 R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $26.4 million, compared to $20.9 million in 2022, due to increased employee headcount, compensation and benefits, including share-based compensation, increased operating costs, and increased pre-clinical study and clinical trial expenses, particularly in our U.S. ReSTART trial, with a smaller offset through government grants from the Israel Innovation Authority. Marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $1.9 million, compared to $1.0 million for 2022 due to increased employee compensation and benefits, including share-based compensation, and the hiring of our chief commercial officer. G&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $7.3 million, compared to $10.3 million for 2022, due to to decreased professional fees (including D&O insurance), and costs associated with our financing transaction in the first quarter of 2022. Financial expenses (income), net, for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $(6.5) million, compared to $1.6 million for 2022, due to revaluation of warrants and an increase in interest from bank deposits, offset by changes in foreign exchange rates. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company had a net loss of $29.2 million, or $0.42 per share, compared to a net loss of $33.8 million, or $0.53 per share, in 2022.

The Company expects that this cash balance will be sufficient to fund operations for at least two years. About Alpha DaRT™ Alpha DaRT (Diffusing Alpha-emitters Radiation Therapy) is designed to enable highly potent and conformal alpha-irradiation of solid tumors by intratumoral delivery of radium-224 impregnated sources. When the radium decays, its short-lived daughters are released from the sources and disperse while emitting high-energy alpha particles with the goal of destroying the tumor. Since the alpha-emitting atoms diffuse only a short distance, Alpha DaRT aims to mainly affect the tumor, and to spare the healthy tissue around it. About Alpha Tau Medical, Ltd. Founded in 2016, Alpha Tau is an Israeli medical device company that focuses on research, development, and potential commercialization of the Alpha DaRT for the treatment of solid tumors. The technology was initially developed by Prof. Itzhak Kelson and Prof. Yona Keisari from Tel Aviv University.

(GEVO) announced financial results for Q4 and full year 2023, highlighting positive cash position and strong RNG project performance. The company expects significant growth in cash EBITDA from RNG sales and Verity software. Gevo's CEO outlined strategic plans for Net-Zero 1 project and collaboration with LG Chem for ETO technology. Financially, Gevo reported increased revenue and interest income but incurred losses in operations and cash EBITDA for Q4. The company aims to lead in ultra-low carbon ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel production. Positive None. Negative Loss from operations and cash EBITDA for Q4 2023. Increased costs in production, depreciation, and general administrative expenses for FY 2023. Impairment loss recorded in FY 2022 impacting financial results. Decrease in other income for FY 2023 compared to FY 2022. Market Research Analyst Gevo, Inc.'s recent financial results and corporate highlights indicate a strategic focus on Net-Zero 1 development and Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) projects. The company's cash position at the end of Q4 is substantial, with $375.6 million in reserves, signifying a strong liquidity status that could reassure investors about the company's financial health and its ability to fund ongoing projects without additional capital raises. The projected use of cash for achieving financial close on Net-Zero 1 falls within industry norms for such large-scale projects.Gevo's RNG project's positive non-GAAP cash EBITDA suggests operational efficiency and a potential increase in cash flow, especially with the anticipated CARB CI score. Moreover, the correlation between LCFS prices and RNG EBITDA underscores the importance of regulatory frameworks and market conditions in evaluating the company's future revenue streams. However, the disclaimer regarding the uncertainty of LCFS price increases and Treasury rules reflects the inherent risks associated with regulatory dependencies.The introduction of the Verity Tracking platform represents a diversification strategy into SaaS, targeting carbon intensity tracking in the ethanol industry. This move could potentially open new revenue streams and provide competitive advantages in a market increasingly focused on sustainability. Financial Analyst Gevo's financial performance for the fourth quarter shows a mixed picture, with a non-GAAP cash EBITDA loss of $12.5 million alongside a net loss per share of $0.08. These figures could raise concerns among investors regarding the company's profitability in the short term. However, the positive EBITDA from the RNG project could signal the potential for improved financial performance in the future, particularly if the company continues to scale up production and optimize operations.Revenue growth, primarily driven by RNG and environmental attributes, shows the company's strategic shift towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly products, which is in line with broader market trends. The increase in interest and investment income is a positive indicator, reflecting effective cash management and benefitting from higher interest rates.It is also worth noting the decrease in general and administrative expenses, which suggests disciplined cost management. However, investors should be mindful of the increase in project development costs and how these investments will translate into future revenue. Energy Sector Analyst Gevo's focus on Net-Zero 1 and RNG projects is indicative of the company's strategic alignment with the energy transition and the growing demand for low-carbon fuels. The company's collaboration with McDermott and the U.S. Department of Energy for a loan guarantee could be a significant enabler for the construction of what is anticipated to be the world's cleanest ultra-low carbon ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel plant.The RNG project's performance, particularly its high utilization rate and the expected increase in cash EBITDA upon receipt of the CARB CI score, demonstrates Gevo's operational capabilities in this sector. The potential for increased cash flow from the RNG business, coupled with the SAF tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, could position Gevo favorably within the renewable energy market.However, the company's reliance on regulatory incentives and market conditions, such as LCFS prices and the biogas PTC, adds a layer of uncertainty to its financial projections. Stakeholders should consider these factors when evaluating the company's long-term viability and potential for growth within the renewable energy sector. 03/07/2024 - 04:01 PM Gevo to Host Conference Call Today at 4:30 p.m. ETENGLEWOOD, Colo., March 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ: GEVO) (“Gevo”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 and recent corporate highlights. Recent Corporate Highlights Net-Zero 1 and 2024 Expected Uses of Cash: We ended the fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $375.6 million. The total that Gevo expects to have spent to achieve financial close is $236.0 million - $238.0 million (excluding certain internal cost allocations), of which only $125.0 million - $175.0 million is remaining. The expected spend on Net-Zero 1 constitutes the majority of growth and project related uses of cash expected in 2024. Renewable Natural Gas (“RNG”): In the fourth quarter, our RNG project generated positive, stand-alone non-GAAP cash EBITDA1 of approximately $1.3 million and annualized production of 91% of the 400,000 MMBtu per year of RNG capacity. As previously announced in January 2024, RNG stand-alone non-GAAP cash EBITDA is expected to increase to $12.0 – $16.0 million on an annualized basis upon receipt of our permanent California Air Resource Board (“CARB”) carbon intensity (“CI”) score, which is expected in 2024. RNG stand-alone non-GAAP cash EBITDA could further increase up to $30.0 – $38.0 million if California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) prices recover to $200 per metric ton, and up to $50.0 – $60.0 million in aggregate upon receipt of the biogas Production Tax Credit (“PTC”) during 2025 – 2027. There can be no guarantee that LCFS prices will increase or United States Treasury rules, if issued, will result in the amounts expected. Verity: In the third quarter of 2023, our Verity Tracking platform went live with farmers in South Dakota and Minnesota. Our tracked ethanol plant customers totaled approximately 2% of the United States ethanol industry by volume, the world’s largest ethanol market. Based on a market and business analysis by a well-known global consulting firm, the initial target market for Verity in the United States is estimated to be approximately $1.5 - $3.0 billion for reducing and tracking the reduction of carbon intensity through the value chain, from field to fuel. Verity is a capital-light, fee-based software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) business that enables the accurate tracking of carbon intensity end-to-end across value chains, helping customers unlock and maximize value derived from carbon abatement. Business Update: On January 24, 2024, Gevo provided an update to its corporate investor presentation and a business update regarding Net Zero 1 project development, RNG, Verity and Ethanol-to-Olefins (“ETO”) technology development. Additional details can be found in the announcement dated January 24, 2024 and in the corporate investor presentation available on our website. 2023 Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights Ended the fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $375.6 million. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we sold 90,666 MMBtu of RNG from our RNG project, or 362,664 MMBtu on an annualized basis, which is approximately 91% of our current capacity of 400,000 MMBtu per year. Revenue of $4.4 million for the fourth quarter includes RNG sales of $0.2 million and $4.2 million of net proceeds from sales of environmental attributes. Combined revenue and interest income increased to $9.4 million for the fourth quarter. Loss from operations of $21.3 million for the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP cash EBITDA loss1 of $12.5 million for the fourth quarter. Gevo NW Iowa RNG generated positive, stand-alone non-GAAP cash EBITDA1 of $1.3 million for the fourth quarter. Net loss per share of $0.08 for the fourth quarter. ______________________________1 Cash EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization and non-cash stock-based compensation to GAAP loss from operations. A reconciliation of cash EBITDA to GAAP loss from operations is provided in the financial statement tables following this release. Management Comment Commenting on the fourth quarter of 2023 and recent corporate events, Dr. Patrick R. Gruber, Gevo’s Chief Executive Officer, said “We released some detailed guidance in January of our expected uses of cash in 2024, and our fully-funded development plan for Net-Zero 1. We hope our shareholders will take a look at that and take note of our latest corporate investor presentation as well, which lays it out visually. Simply put: we ended the year with what we believe is enough cash to service the remaining spend by Gevo to deliver Net-Zero 1 in a project finance format. We don’t expect a need to spend more than that on the project. We believe Net-Zero 1 will be the cleanest ultra-low carbon ethanol and net zero sustainable aviation fuel plant in the world, and we are very excited to be working with McDermott and the U.S. Department of Energy on the requirements for a loan guarantee to help fund that construction. We are pleased that our RNG business achieved strong utilization last quarter, including the capacity expansion we completed last year. We see significant embedded upside from that business to Gevo from a cash flow perspective, simply by continuing to operate it at the expanded capacity and delivering meaningful carbon abatement to our customers. We look forward to announcing Verity’s first revenue this year. And we look forward to working with our partner, LG Chem, on commercializing our Ethanol-to-Olefins (“ETO”) technology, which started pilot-scale production, to deliver ultra-low carbon plastics and materials to the world.” Dr. Gruber concluded, “We are pleased that the Department of Treasury has made significant progress toward implementation of the SAF tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, starting with the guidance released in December 2023 confirming that an updated Argonne GREET method and model would be used for this purpose. We look forward to reviewing the final GREET model and guidance from the SAF Interagency Working Group and Department of Treasury. The guidance already given indicates that both carbon capture sequestration and improvements in agriculture are planned to be included in the section 45-Z rules once finalized. We believe science-based methodologies must be used to account for emissions reductions from feedstock production, encompassing climate-smart agriculture practices, as well as for emissions reductions from carbon capture and storage, to acknowledge, incentivize and increase carbon reduction efforts across the value chain. A growing market for SAF made from low-carbon feedstocks is expected to open up new markets for American farmers to sell their products.” Full Year 2023 Financial Results Operating revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2023, revenue increased $16.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to sales of RNG and environmental attributes from our RNG project. Sales under our RNG project commenced in the third quarter of 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold 313,572 MMBtu of RNG, resulting in biogas commodity sales of $0.7 million and environmental attribute sales of $14.8 million. Additionally, we recognized $1.3 million of licensing and development revenue from the agreement with LG Chem as well as $0.4 million from the sale of isooctane during the year ended December 31, 2023. Cost of production. Cost of production increased $3.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the production and sales from our RNG project, which significantly increased in 2023, after the ramp-up phase, as well as lower costs at the idling Luverne Facility in 2023. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased $11.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a full three quarters of additional depreciation expense in 2023 for RNG assets placed into service in the third quarter of 2022 and accelerated depreciation on Agri-Energy segment assets due to shorter lives stemming from the impairment assessment during the third quarter of 2022. Research and development expense. Research and development expense decreased $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a reduction of consulting expenses, partially offset by an increase in personnel related costs due to additional headcount added during the year ended December 31, 2023. General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense increased $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to increases in personnel costs related to the hiring of highly qualified and skilled professionals, professional consulting fees, and stock-based compensation. Project development costs. Project development costs are related to our future Net-Zero projects and Verity which consist primarily of employee expenses, preliminary engineering costs, and technical consulting costs. Project development costs increased $4.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to increases in personnel costs and consulting fees. Facility idling costs. Facility idling costs are related to care and maintenance of our Luverne Facility. Facility idling costs decreased by $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to one-time charges recorded during 2022 related to removing flammable and other hazardous items from the site, writing off certain patents, and reduction in the workforce. Impairment loss. No impairment loss was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a $24.7 million impairment loss on long-lived assets, which reduced the carrying value of certain property, plant, and equipment, and a leased right of use asset, at the Agri-Energy segment to its fair value. The impairments recorded relate to the determination to suspend production at the Luverne Facility and shift the plant into an idled, care and maintenance status during the third quarter of 2022. The impact of the one-time impairment charge of $24.7 million was $0.11 of basic and diluted impairment loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2022. Loss on disposal of assets. The Company did not record a loss on disposal of assets for the year ended December 31, 2023. As a result of suspending the production of ethanol at the Luverne Facility, we wrote-off $0.5 million of costs during the year ended December 31, 2022, related to ancillary equipment and spare parts that are no longer expected to be utilized at the Luverne Facility. The equipment and spare parts had been planned to be used in ethanol production. Loss from operations. The Company’s loss from operations decreased by $20.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to increased revenue from RNG operations and LG Chem licensing in 2023, as well as the 2022 impairment loss, partially offset by the increase in costs for our Net-Zero projects, Verity, and USDA Climate-Smart Grant projects. Interest expense. Interest expense increased by $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the interest on the RNG project bonds, which was capitalized into construction in process during the construction phase of our RNG project in the prior periods. Interest and investment income. Interest and investment income increased $15.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in interest earned on our cash equivalent investments as a result of higher interest rates. Other income. Other income decreased $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the receipt of $0.4 million from the USDA's Biofuel Producer Program in 2023 compared to $2.9 million in 2022. In addition, our termination of the expediting procurement agreement with a local utility resulted in a one-time charge of $1.6 million in 2023.

About Gevo Gevo’s mission is to transform renewable energy and carbon into energy-dense liquid hydrocarbons. These liquid hydrocarbons can be used for drop-in transportation fuels such as gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel fuel, that when burned have potential to yield net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when measured across the full lifecycle of the products. Gevo uses low-carbon renewable resource-based carbohydrates as raw materials and is in an advanced state of developing renewable electricity and renewable natural gas for use in production processes, resulting in low-carbon fuels with substantially reduced carbon intensity (the level of greenhouse gas emissions compared to standard petroleum fossil-based fuels across their lifecycle). Gevo’s products perform as well or better than traditional fossil-based fuels in infrastructure and engines, but with substantially reduced greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to addressing the problems of fuels, Gevo’s technology also enables certain plastics, such as polyester, to be made with more sustainable ingredients. Gevo’s ability to penetrate the growing low-carbon fuels market depends on the price of oil and the value of abating carbon emissions that would otherwise increase greenhouse gas emissions. Gevo believes that it possesses the technology and know-how to convert various carbohydrate feedstocks through a fermentation process into alcohols and then transform the alcohols into renewable fuels and materials, through a combination of its own technology, know-how, engineering, and licensing of technology and engineering from Axens North America, Inc., which yields the potential to generate project and corporate returns that justify the build-out of a multi-billion-dollar business. Gevo believes that Argonne National Laboratory GREET model is the best available standard of scientific based measurement for life cycle inventory or LCI.

Non-GAAP Financial Information This press release contains a financial measure that does not comply with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), including non-GAAP cash EBITDA. Non-GAAP cash EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization and non-cash stock-based compensation from GAAP loss from operations. Management believes this measure is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. This non-GAAP financial measure also facilitates management’s internal comparisons to Gevo’s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. In addition, Gevo believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it allows for greater transparency into the indicators used by management as a basis for its financial and operational decision making. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Gevo’s operating performance.
