(PMI) celebrates the 10-Year Anniversary of IQOS with the launch of IQOS ILUMA i, the latest addition to its smoke-free products. The company aims for over two-thirds of its revenue to come from smoke-free products by 2030. IQOS has surpassed Marlboro in net revenues, leading to a decline in cigarette sales in many countries. IQOS ILUMA i features advanced technology and offers a clean, seamless, and flexible experience for adult smokers. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The introduction of the IQOS ILUMA i by Philip Morris International represents a significant milestone in the company's strategic shift towards smoke-free products. This move underscores the broader industry trend where traditional tobacco companies are diversifying their portfolios to include reduced-risk products amid increasing regulatory pressures and changing consumer preferences. The claim that IQOS ILUMA i emits 95% lower levels of harmful chemicals compared to cigarettes could strengthen PMI's market position, potentially leading to increased market share in the heat-not-burn (HnB) category.From a market perspective, PMI's target of having over two-thirds of its total net revenue come from smoke-free products by 2030 is ambitious. Achieving this goal could result in a significant transformation of its revenue streams, reducing dependency on traditional cigarettes. The rapid adoption of IQOS in markets like Japan, where it has reportedly become the number one international nicotine brand, indicates a strong consumer shift towards HnB products. This shift could have a ripple effect on competitors, possibly sparking further innovation and investment in the smoke-free sector. Financial Analyst Financially, the milestone of IQOS net revenues surpassing those of Marlboro is a testament to the product's commercial success and indicates a substantial change in consumer behavior. For investors, the performance of IQOS will be a critical factor to watch, as it could serve as a leading indicator of PMI's future financial health. The company's investment in research and development, as highlighted by the CEO, suggests a commitment to maintaining a competitive edge, which could be favorable for long-term growth.It is also noteworthy that PMI has achieved a situation where smoke-free product revenues exceed 50% of total net revenue in 25 markets. This diversification could potentially mitigate business risks associated with traditional tobacco sales and align PMI with evolving regulatory landscapes. However, investors should consider the substantial capital required for such R&D and market expansion, which may affect short-term profitability but could be justified if the long-term shift towards smoke-free products continues. Medical Research Analyst The health implications of the shift towards smoke-free alternatives like the IQOS ILUMA i are significant. The claim of a 95% reduction in harmful chemical emissions, if substantiated, could suggest a reduced health risk for users compared to traditional smoking. This could potentially influence public health policies and regulatory frameworks globally. The role of government and regulatory bodies, as mentioned by the CEO, is indeed crucial in determining the success of such products. Regulatory endorsements or restrictions can have a profound impact on the adoption rates and market penetration of HnB products.For the medical community, the long-term health effects of these products remain a subject of ongoing research. While the immediate reduction in harmful emissions is a positive step, comprehensive studies are needed to understand the full spectrum of health outcomes associated with prolonged use of HnB products. Such data will be vital for stakeholders, including healthcare providers, regulators and consumers, to make informed decisions. 03/13/2024 - 03:30 AM Celebrates the 10-Year Anniversary of IQOS & Looks Forward to the Next Ten LAUSANNE, Switzerland--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI) (NYSE: PM) today announced the launch of IQOS ILUMA i, the latest and most innovative addition to its growing portfolio of smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke or use nicotine products. Today, this range of better alternatives to cigarettes includes multiple generations of IQOS, the No. 1 tobacco heating system.1 The launch also marks the 10-Year anniversary of IQOS, originally launching in Nagoya, Japan in 2014. “We leverage science, world leading brands and commercial capabilities to provide better alternatives to our consumers. This anniversary provides an opportunity to renew our smoke-free vision and our ambition for over two-thirds of our total net revenue to come from smoke-free products by 2030,” said PMI CEO Jacek Olczak. “IQOS ILUMA disrupted the category by introducing induction-heating technology that heats tobacco from within, to provide a consistent taste experience, no tobacco residue, and no need to clean the device. Today, we take IQOS to new heights, with the launch of IQOS ILUMA i—the latest innovation in our smoke-free portfolio, offering a range of advanced features for a clean, seamless, and more flexible experience.” Over the past 10 years, PMI’s portfolio of scientifically backed smoke-free alternatives, led by IQOS, has created a positive impact on millions of adult smokers and those around them by accelerating an end to cigarettes. Within 10 years, IQOS net revenues have surpassed those for Marlboro, making it the number one international nicotine brand and accelerated the decline of cigarettes in many countries. In Japan, for example, nearly one-third of adult smokers are using IQOS2 and cigarette sales have declined much more rapidly since heated tobacco was launched. Today, there are 25 markets where PMI’s smoke-free product revenues exceed 50% of total net revenue, including Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Poland, and Romania. “IQOS ILUMA i is our most innovative offering to date and the new flagship in our portfolio of scientifically substantiated, heat-not-burn smoke-free systems,” said Bertrand Bonvin, President Heat-Not-Burn Platforms at PMI. “Like previous IQOS devices, it emits, on average, 95% lower levels of harmful chemicals compared with cigarettes.3,4 We are proud that consumer feedback continuously fuels our innovation, and IQOS ILUMA i is a testament to that.” Olczak added: “We have been investing heavily in research and development to provide adults who smoke with better alternatives to cigarettes based on cutting-edge science. But for change to be effectively enacted, government and society at large must play their part. It is important that others—like government authorities and regulators—embrace the opportunity offered by innovation and science to benefit the world.” IQOS ILUMA i features The IQOS ILUMA i series offers three devices in Japan: IQOS ILUMA i PRIME, IQOS ILUMA i and IQOS ILUMA i ONE. All three devices bring a range of adaptable new features. It already delivers an experience that is clean, seamless, and pleasurable thanks to PMI’s bladeless SMARTCORE INDUCTION SYSTEMTM in a variety of designs to meet the diverse preferences of consumers. The new touch screen on the device’s holder allows users to see experience-relevant information quickly and easily. To personalize the experience, IQOS ILUMA i introduces a new Pause Mode. By swiping up or down on the touch screen, users can pause and resume their smoke-free moment where they left off5, without worrying about wasting a stick. Additionally, FlexPuff allows users to enjoy the experience at their pace6. The new IQOS ILUMA i additionally includes smart features like FlexBattery that help prolong the lifespan of the holder’s battery7, contributing to electronic waste reduction, as part of our efforts to reduce the environmental impact of our products. Furthermore, the door for IQOS ILUMA i is made from aluminum produced with renewable energy and the inner textile layer of IQOS ILUMA i’s PRIME leather-like wrap is made of 100% recycled plastic.

Philip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free Future Philip Morris International (PMI) is a leading international tobacco company, actively delivering a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested $12.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioural research, as well as post-market studies. In 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match – a leader in oral nicotine delivery – creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables and Swedish Match’s General snus as Modified Risk Tobacco Products. As of December 31, 2023, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 84 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 20.8 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. Smoke-free products accounted for approximately 37% of PMI’s total full-year 2023 net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI announced in February 2021 its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and, through its Vectura Fertin Pharma business, aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences.

The five holes from the winter program were all drilled at the Echo pegmatite complex whereas the 2023 holes are from the Fi Main, Fi Southwest, and Fi Boye pegmatites. A table of composite calculations, general comments related to this discussion, and a table of collar headers are provided towards the end of this section. Francis MacDonald, CEO of LIFT comments, “The Echo pegmatite is living up to initial expectations. We are seeing a complex stacked set of spodumene pegmatites that are shallow-dipping which is very favorable for open pit mining. Drill hole YLP-0216 intersected three branches of pegmatite that total 36 meters within one drill hole.” Figure 1 – Location of LIFT’s Yellowknife Lithium Project. Drilling has been thus far focused on the Near Field Group of pegmatites which are located to the east of the city of Yellowknife along a government-maintained paved highway, as well as the Echo target in the Further Afield Group. Echo Pegmatite System The Echo pegmatite complex comprises a fanning splay of moderate to gently dipping dykes at its northwest end (“Echo splay”) that consolidates into a steeply dipping, northwest-trending, feeder dyke (“Echo feeder""). The dyke complex has a total strike length of over 1.0 km with individual dykes up to 25 m wide. The holes in this news release were all drilled into the Echo splay and are described from nearest to furthest from the Echo feeder dyke. YLP-0216 was collared 400 m northwest of the Echo feeder to test the Echo splay approximately 250 m from its northwestern mapped extent, <25 to 100 m below the surface, and 50 m downdip of previously released YLP-0128 (1.24% Li2O over 10 m and 1.20% Li2O over 5 m). Drilling intersected an 87 m interval with 50 m of pegmatite spread over three dykes between 13-23 m in width. Assays returned significant composites for all three of these dykes, with the upper one returning 1.57% Li2O over 10 m, the middle dyke assaying 1.29% Li2O over 10 m, and the lower-most one returning 1.26% Li2O over 16 m (Table 1 & 2, Figures 2 & 3). Figure 2 – Plan view showing the surface expression of the Echo pegmatite with diamond drill holes reported in this press release. Figure 3 – Cross-section illustrating YLP-0216 with results as shown in the Echo pegmatite dyke with a 16 m interval of 1.26% Li2O. YLP-0207 tested the Echo splay on a section 50 m northwest of YLP-0216, approximately 450 m northwest of the Echo feeder, 200 m from its northwestern mapped extent, 25-50 m below the surface, and 100 m up-dip from YLP-0213 (see below). Drilling intersected a 65 m wide interval with 25 m of pegmatite spread over three dykes that are between 6-12 m wide. Assays returned composites of 0.95% Li2O over 10 m from the upper-most dyke, which includes 5 m of 1.47% Li2O, as well as 0.79% Li2O over 1 m from the second dyke. YLP-0213 tested the same section as YLP-207 but with intersections targeted 50 m further downdip to 75-100 m below the surface. Drilling intersected two dyke corridors separated by 55 m of country rock. The upper corridor is 66 m wide with 30 m of pegmatite spread over a 16 m wide dyke and five subsidiary dykes between 1-6 m in width. The lower corridor comprises a single dyke that is 23 m wide. Assays returned 1.20% Li2O over 14 m from the thick dyke in the upper corridor along with 0.59% Li2O over 1 m from one of the subsidiary dykes. The lower corridor returned a composite of 0.73% Li2O over 15 m that includes 2 m of 1.43% Li2O (Table 1 & 2, Figures 2 & 4). Figure 4 – Cross-section illustrating YLP-0213 with results as shown in the Echo pegmatite dyke with a 14 m interval of 1.20% Li2O. YLP-0211 was collared 100 m northwest of YLP-0213 to test the Echo splay approximately 550 m from the feeder dyke, 100 m from its northwest extent, 50-100 m below the surface, and 50 m downdip of YLP-0203 (1.24% Li2O over 13 m). Drilling intersected two intervals of increased pegmatite; an upper one that is 35 m wide with 20 m of pegmatite spread over three dykes between 4-10 m in width as well as a lower one that is 17 m wide and contains 13 m of pegmatite. Assays for the upper interval returned 0.91% Li2O over 10 m and 0.54% Li2O over 6 m, the former including 4 m of 1.85% Li2O. The lower interval returned composites of 0.50% Li2O over 9 m and 0.50% Li2O over 4 m (Table 1 & 2, Figures 2 & 5). Figure 5: – Cross-section illustrating YLP-0208 with results as shown in the Echo pegmatite dyke with a 10 m interval of 0.95% Li2O. YLP-0208 tested the tip of the Echo splay just 50 m from its northwest mapped extent, 600 m from the feeder dyke, 50-100 m below the surface, and 50 m downdip of YLP-0202 (0.90% Li2O over 3 m and 0.50% Li2O over 7 m). Drilling intersected a 58 m wide interval with 32 m of pegmatite spread over four dykes between 3-12 m in width. Assay composites for the upper-most dyke returned 0.95% Li2O over 10 m that includes 6 m at 1.38% Li2O whereas the lower-most dyke returned 1.00% Li2O over 3 m (Table 1 & 2, Figures 2 & 6). Figure 6: – Cross-section illustrating YLP-0211 with results as shown in the Echo pegmatite dyke with a 10 m interval of 0.91% Li2O. Fi Main Pegmatite The Fi Main pegmatite is located 250 m to the northeast of the Fi-SW pegmatite complex and crops out over at least 1.5 km of strike length. The structure dips between 70°-85° to the west-northwest and consists of two or more dykes that appear to coalesce in the central part of the complex. YLP-0190 tested the Fi Main complex approximately 200 m north of the historically mapped northern end extent of the complex and 400 m north of the 2nd most northerly hole (YLP-0024) that returned 1.12% Li2O over 24 m. Drilling intersected a 126 m wide corridor with 31 m of pegmatite split among two 11 m wide dykes as well as five 1-3 m wide dykes. No significant assay results were returned (Table 1 & 2, Figure 7). Fi Boye Pegmatite The Fi Boye pegmatite comprises a corridor of mostly north-south striking, steeply east-dipping, dykes that run parallel to, and lie 500-700 m west of, the Fi Main complex. The Fi Boye corridor has at least 1.7 km of striking length, contains between 1-5 dykes, and ranges from approximately 10-200 m in width. Only two holes were drilled on this dyke in 2023, one of which is reported below. YLP-0186 was drilled to test the Fi Boye dyke approximately 500 m from its northern mapped extent and 100 m beneath the surface. Drilling intersected a 25 m wide corridor with 21 m of pegmatite that returned negligible assay results (Table 1 & 2, Figure 7). Figure 7 – Plan view showing the surface expression of the Fi Main and Fi Boye pegmatites with diamond drill holes reported in this press release. Fi Southwest Pegmatite The Fi SW dyke strikes over at least 1.1 km on surface with an average outcropping width of approximately 20 m. The dyke dips between 60°- 80° to the east-southeast and trends towards the north-northeast. Drilling of Fi SW show that it ranges from a single 20-40 m wide dyke to 2-3 dykes of similar cumulative width within a 50-70 m wide corridor. YLP-0187 tested the Fi SW pegmatite approximately 150 m from its northern mapped extent and 250 m vertically below the surface, as well as 50 m, 125 m, and 200 m downdip of, respectively, previously released intersections that ranged between 1.2-1.5% Li2O over 12-23 m (YLP-0031, 0047, 0125).

Drill core was transported from the drill platform to the core processing facility where it was logged, photographed, and split by diamond saw prior to being sampled. Samples were then bagged, and blanks and certified reference materials were inserted at regular intervals. Field duplicates consisting of quarter-cut core samples were also included in the sample runs. Groups of samples were placed in large bags, sealed with numbered tags in order to maintain a chain-of-custody, and transported from LIFT’s core logging facility to ALS Labs (“ALS”) laboratory in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. Sample preparation and analytical work for this drill program were carried out by ALS. Samples were prepared for analysis according to ALS method CRU31: individual samples were crushed to 70% passing through 2 mm (10 mesh) screen; a 1,000-gram sub-sample was riffle split (SPL-21) and then pulverized (PUL-32) such that 85% passed through 75 micron (200 mesh) screen. A 0.2-gram sub-sample of the pulverized material was then dissolved in a sodium peroxide solution and analysed for lithium according to ALS method ME-ICP82b. Another 0.2-gram sub-sample of the pulverized material was analysed for 53 elements according to ALS method ME-MS89L. All results passed the QA/QC screening at the lab, all inserted standards and blanks returned results that were within acceptable limits.

The Board may adjust the program periodically based on market conditions. Additionally, the Company declared an annual cash dividend of US$0.0072 per ordinary share, payable on April 19, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The extension of Full Truck Alliance Co. Ltd.'s share repurchase program signals a strong vote of confidence from the Board in the company's financial health and future prospects. The decision to repurchase up to US$300 million of its ADSs is a strategic move that can potentially reduce the company's equity float and increase earnings per share, which might be seen as an attractive move for investors. By funding these repurchases with existing cash balances, FTA is demonstrating significant liquidity, which is a positive indicator of its operational efficiency and financial stability.Moreover, the declaration of an annual cash dividend of US$0.0072 per ordinary share, totaling approximately US$150 million, is a tangible return to shareholders and underlines the company's commitment to shareholder value. This dividend payout, while modest, can contribute to the stock's attractiveness as an income-generating investment. However, investors should also consider the opportunity cost of the cash used for repurchases and dividends, which could otherwise be invested in growth opportunities or used to strengthen the balance sheet further. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, FTA's announcement is likely to influence investor sentiment positively. Share repurchase programs are often interpreted by the market as a sign that a company's leadership believes the stock is undervalued. This can lead to a short-term increase in the stock price as investors react to the news. Long-term implications of such a program depend on the overall market conditions and the company's future performance.It is also important to monitor industry trends, as the digital freight platform sector is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological changes. FTA's ability to generate sufficient cash flow to support both a share repurchase program and a dividend payout suggests operational resilience, but it is crucial to assess whether this capital allocation aligns with the company's long-term strategic goals and the demands of an evolving market landscape. Legal Expert The mention of compliance with Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is crucial as it ensures that FTA's share repurchases are conducted within the legal framework designed to prevent market manipulation. These rules dictate the manner, timing, price and volume of stock repurchases, which are safeguards to maintain market integrity. Investors should be reassured by FTA's adherence to these regulations, as it reflects the company's commitment to transparency and legal compliance.Additionally, the safe harbor statement included in the press release is a standard legal disclaimer aimed at mitigating the company's liability for any forward-looking statements. While these statements provide insight into the company's expectations, they are not guarantees of future performance and investors should remain cautious and conduct their due diligence beyond the optimistic projections. 03/13/2024 - 04:00 AM GUIYANG, China, March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Full Truck Alliance Co. Ltd. (""FTA"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: YMM), a leading digital freight platform, today announced an extension of its share repurchase program. As previously reported by the Company, its board of directors (the ""Board"") authorized a share repurchase program with an original expiration date of March 12, 2024. The Board resolved to extend the term of the share repurchase program such that the Company may repurchase up to approximately US$300 million of its American depositary shares (the ""ADSs""), each representing 20 Class A ordinary shares and/or ordinary shares, through March 12, 2025. Repurchases under the Company's share repurchase program may be made from time to time through open market transactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions, in block trades, and/or through other legally permissible means, depending on the market conditions and in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations. The Board will review the share repurchase program periodically, and may authorize adjustments to its terms and size or suspend or discontinue the program. The timing and conditions of the share repurchases will be subject to various factors, including the requirements under Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company expects to fund the repurchases with its existing cash balance. Upon review of the Company's results of operations, business development plan, capital requirements, and cash position, the Board is confident in the Company's business performance and outlook. Accordingly, on March 13, 2024, the Board declared an annual cash dividend for the year ended December 31, 2023, of US$0.0072 per ordinary share, or US$0.1444 per ADS, payable on or around April 19, 2024, to holders of record of the Company's ordinary shares at the close of business on April 5, 2024.

The Company intends to cancel the purchased shares, holding 164,334,146 ordinary shares in issue.","InterContinental Hotels Group PLC Announces Transaction in Own Shares - March 13 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary InterContinental Hotels Group PLC announces the purchase of 10,000 of its own ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange. The Company intends to cancel the purchased shares, holding 164,334,146 ordinary shares in issue. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The company's recent share repurchase is a significant financial maneuver that can have various implications on its market valuation and shareholder value. By reducing the number of shares available in the market, the company is potentially increasing the earnings per share (EPS), which could lead to a higher stock price. This action usually signals the management's confidence in the long-term prospects of the company, indicating that they believe the stock is undervalued.However, it is also critical to assess the opportunity cost of such a buyback. The funds used for share repurchases could have been allocated to other growth opportunities or debt reduction. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the company's financial health, including its cash reserves and debt levels, to understand whether the buyback is a strategic move or a short-term tactic to prop up the share price. Financial Analyst The execution of the share buyback at a volume-weighted average price provides insight into the company's approach to returning value to shareholders. The cancellation of the purchased shares will reduce the total number of shares outstanding, which could positively affect the company's financial ratios. It's imperative to evaluate the impact of this buyback on the company's balance sheet and its ability to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility.Furthermore, the timing and price range of the buyback could be indicative of the company's market timing strategies. An analysis of the historical stock price performance and comparison with the buyback price range may offer insights into the effectiveness of the buyback program and its alignment with shareholder interests. Corporate Governance Expert The share buyback has been conducted under the authority granted by shareholders, which reflects a level of corporate governance and adherence to shareholder rights. It is important to evaluate the transparency and communication of the company with its shareholders regarding the buyback program. Additionally, the impact of the share cancellation on the distribution of voting power among remaining shareholders should be considered, as it may lead to changes in the control dynamics of the company.Moreover, the role of the investment firm handling the transactions, in this case, Goldman Sachs International and the disclosed breakdown of purchases, contribute to the governance quality by ensuring fairness and preventing market manipulation. 03/13/2024 - 03:00 AM Purchase of own sharesLONDON, UK / ACCESSWIRE / March 13, 2024 / The Company announces that on 12 March 2024 it purchased the following number of its ordinary shares of 20 340/399 pence each through Goldman Sachs International ("" GSI "") on the London Stock Exchange in accordance with the authority granted by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2023 (the "" Purchase "").

The company aims to impact the burden of certain HPV-related cancers and diseases by expanding protection and supply capacity. Positive Merck (MRK) is investing in the development of a new investigational multi-valent HPV vaccine to provide broader protection against multiple HPV types. The company plans to conduct clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single-dose regimen of GARDASIL 9 compared to the approved three-dose regimen. Merck (MRK) is addressing the increasing global demand for HPV vaccines by expanding manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated demand for 2025 and beyond. The company is investing in research to identify new candidates with the potential to extend protection against a broader array of HPV types, particularly in African and Asian populations. Merck (MRK) is responding to scientific calls for more clinical data on alternative dosing regimens for GARDASIL 9 by planning two prospective clinical trials to assess the potential efficacy and durability of a single dose. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst Merck's announcement regarding the development of a new investigational multi-valent HPV vaccine and the exploration of a single-dose regimen for GARDASIL®9 is a significant stride in the field of immunization and public health. The expanded protection against multiple HPV types, especially those with higher prevalence in African and Asian populations, could potentially lead to a reduction in HPV-related diseases globally. This is particularly relevant as HPV is known to cause various cancers and genital warts. The move to a single-dose regimen, if proven effective, could simplify vaccination protocols and improve compliance rates, potentially increasing vaccine coverage.From a medical research perspective, the initiation of Phase 1 studies for the new vaccine candidate and the prospective clinical trials for the single-dose regimen will be closely monitored. The outcome of these studies will provide valuable data on the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of these interventions. A successful single-dose regimen could also significantly reduce healthcare costs and logistical barriers associated with multiple-dose schedules. However, it is crucial that these studies are rigorous and that the vaccines provide long-term protection to maintain herd immunity. Health Economist The investments made by Merck in the clinical development of a new HPV vaccine and the assessment of a single-dose regimen could have far-reaching economic implications. The reduction of a three-dose to a single-dose regimen, if effective, could lower vaccination program costs for governments and healthcare payers, thus enabling wider access to the vaccine, especially in low-resource settings. Additionally, broader protection against HPV could decrease the incidence of HPV-related cancers, leading to long-term savings in cancer treatment and care.Merck's considerable expansion of its manufacturing capacity to meet the global demand for HPV vaccines is another critical economic factor. By ensuring an adequate supply of vaccines, Merck positions itself to meet current and future market demands, which could positively affect its market share and financial performance. However, the success of these initiatives will depend on regulatory approvals and market acceptance of the new vaccine formulations and dosing regimens. Market Research Analyst The strategic move by Merck to innovate within its HPV vaccine portfolio by developing a new vaccine and testing a single-dose regimen of GARDASIL®9 aligns with the increasing global awareness and demand for effective vaccination programs. The market for HPV vaccines is competitive and Merck's commitment to research and development could enhance its competitive edge and reputation as a leader in the vaccine market.It is essential to consider the potential market reactions to these developments. Positive clinical trial results could lead to increased investor confidence and potentially drive up Merck's stock value. On the other hand, any setbacks in clinical trials or regulatory processes could have an adverse effect on market perception and stock performance. Stakeholders will be interested in the progress of the clinical trials, regulatory outcomes and the ability of Merck to scale up production to meet the projected demands for 2025 and beyond. 03/13/2024 - 03:00 AM Company reaffirms commitment to reduce the global burden of HPV-related diseases, including certain cancers RAHWAY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today, at the EUROGIN 2024 HPV Congress, announced plans to initiate clinical development of a new investigational multi-valent HPV vaccine designed to provide broader protection against multiple HPV types. Separately, the company also plans to conduct clinical trials in both females and males to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single-dose regimen of GARDASIL®9 (Human Papillomavirus 9-valent, recombinant), compared to the approved three-dose regimen. “Evidence continues to emerge showing the importance of GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9 to public health,” said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “These significant investments build upon our leadership and importantly provide the opportunity to further impact the global burden of certain HPV-related cancers and disease.” In the U.S., GARDASIL 9 is indicated for use in females 9 through 45 years of age for the prevention of cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers caused by HPV Types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal precancerous or dysplastic lesions caused by HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; and genital warts caused by HPV Types 6 and 11. GARDASIL 9 is also indicated for use in males 9 through 45 years of age for the prevention of anal, oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers caused by HPV Types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; anal precancerous or dysplastic lesions caused by HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; and genital warts caused by HPV Types 6 and 11. The oropharyngeal and head and neck cancer indication is approved under accelerated approval based on effectiveness in preventing HPV-related anogenital disease. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. The confirmatory trial is ongoing. GARDASIL 9 is contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity, including severe allergic reactions to yeast, or after a previous dose of GARDASIL 9 or GARDASIL® [Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16, and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant]. Multivalent HPV vaccine research Merck vaccine researchers continue to build on the development of GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9 to identify new candidates with the potential to extend protection against a broader array of HPV types. The latest addition to the pipeline employs the company’s proprietary virus-like particle (VLP) technology to incorporate additional VLPs for expanded HPV type coverage. This includes several types known to have more impact in African and Asian populations and individuals of African and Asian descent. First-in-human studies (Phase 1) are scheduled to start in the fourth quarter of 2024. Assessing the potential efficacy and durability of a single dose regimen of GARDASIL 9 In response to calls from scientific leaders for more clinical data concerning alternative dosing regimens for GARDASIL 9, Merck, pending regulatory input, plans to conduct two prospective clinical trials, one in females (16-26 years old) and one in males (ages 16-26 years old). These randomized, double-blind, multi-year clinical trials will examine the short and long-term efficacy and immunogenicity of a single-dose of GARDASIL 9 versus the currently approved three-dose regimen. The goal of these large, randomized trials is to generate data that clearly determines whether or not a single dose of GARDASIL 9 provides comparable long-term protection to the approved three-dose regimen, while also satisfying the high standards required by regulatory authorities. The clinical trials are anticipated to start enrolling participants in the fourth quarter of 2024. HPV vaccine supply To address the increasing global demand for GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9 and support broader and equitable access, Merck has made significant investments in manufacturing to help increase supply. Starting in 2019, the company committed to expand manufacturing capacity by increasing production at existing plants as well as constructing new facilities. Between 2017 and 2020 this resulted in a near doubling of supply which has subsequently been doubled again between 2020 and 2024. Merck expects to supply sufficient quantities of HPV vaccines to meet anticipated demand for 2025 and will continue to expand our supply capacity in the future.

Chemical Engineer The installation of a commercial-scale Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) column by Standard Lithium represents a significant stride in the lithium extraction industry. From a chemical engineering perspective, the transition from demonstration to commercial-scale operations is non-trivial. It involves a scale-up of technology that must maintain efficiency, safety and cost-effectiveness. The reported 95.9% lithium recovery rate is notably high, suggesting an efficient extraction process. However, maintaining this efficiency at a commercial scale will be a critical factor in determining the project's viability. The rejection of over 99.3% of key contaminants indicates a high purity of the lithium chloride solution produced, which is crucial for battery-grade lithium production.Furthermore, the negligible degradation of the sorbent media and the optimization of brine pre-treatment are essential for the longevity and sustainability of the operation. These factors directly influence operational costs and the environmental footprint of the extraction process. The chemical engineering challenges in scaling up such a process include ensuring consistent material properties and process dynamics, which can significantly alter the outcome when moving from a smaller scale operation to full commercial deployment. Market Research Analyst From a market research perspective, Standard Lithium's advancement in DLE technology is timely, given the increasing demand for lithium for electric vehicle (EV) batteries and energy storage solutions. Achieving a commercial-scale operation could position the company as a key player in the North American lithium market, which is currently underdeveloped compared to other regions like South America and Australia. The ability to process large volumes of brine and achieve high lithium recovery rates could give Standard Lithium a competitive advantage in cost and sustainability, factors increasingly important to investors and consumers alike.Moreover, the company's focus on derisking the technology through extensive testing and optimization could enhance investor confidence and potentially impact the stock's performance positively. The partnership with Koch Technology Solutions and the continuous operation of the Demo Plant for over four years provide a solid foundation for the reliability and scalability of the technology. The market will closely watch the commissioning and subsequent performance data to assess the commercial viability and potential market impact of this technology. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial implications of Standard Lithium's latest development, the successful scale-up of DLE technology could have substantial effects on the company's financials. With the lithium market projected to grow significantly due to the EV revolution, the company's ability to produce lithium at high recovery rates and low contaminant levels could translate into lower production costs and higher margins. The long-term financial benefits also hinge on the technology's operational reliability and the potential to reduce environmental and regulatory risks associated with lithium extraction.Investors should note that the capital expenditure required to establish commercial-scale operations can be substantial and the company's ability to manage these costs will be critical. The data from the commercial-scale unit will be vital for project finance processes, providing a clearer picture of the expected return on investment. Additionally, the ongoing FEED and DFS studies will offer more detailed insights into the project's capital and operational cost structures, which are essential for a comprehensive financial analysis. 03/13/2024 - 01:05 AM Further Derisks DLE Process With Testing Planned Using Full-Scale Commercial Equipment Over the Next 6 MonthsEL DORADO, Ark., March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Standard Lithium Ltd. (“Standard Lithium” or the “Company”) (TSXV:SLI) (NYSE American:SLI) (FRA:S5L), a leading near-commercial lithium development company, is pleased to announce that it has successfully installed a commercial-scale Direct Lithium Extraction (“DLE”) column at its Demonstration Plant near El Dorado, Arkansas. The column is a LiPRO™ Lithium Selective Sorption (“LSS”) unit, supplied by Koch Technology Solutions, LLC (“KTS”). The column has been installed and integrated with the Company’s existing Demonstration Plant to test and derisk the design for commercial applications of the LiPRO™ LSS technology. It is the same size and design as those that the Company intends to use (in multiple trains) in its commercial applications for the Phase 1A and South West Arkansas projects (as described in the Company’s recent Definitive Feasibility Study for the Phase 1A project and Preliminary Feasibility Study for the South West Arkansas project). The commercial-scale LiPRO™ LSS column is currently being filled with Koch Engineered Solutions proprietary lithium-selective sorption with commissioning expected later this month. Extensive performance testing of the commercial-scale DLE technology will be performed over the following months under the supervision of Standard Lithium and KTS technical specialists. Standard Lithium’s Director, President & COO, Dr. Andy Robinson commented, “this is an important derisking milestone for Standard Lithium and our partners. Our team has been successfully running the LiPRO™ LSS technology since October 2022, and we have already successfully completed scale-ups of the DLE equipment at the Demonstration Plant; this is our final stage of derisking the technology. The data gathered from this commercial-scale unit will provide crucial validation and derisking information for our ongoing project finance processes, as well as FEED and DFS studies for the South West Arkansas Project (see news release dated 24 January 2024). We’re very grateful for our partners Koch Technology Solutions and LANXESS who have helped to make this final derisking step possible.” Standard Lithium's Demonstration Plant is the only large-scale, continuously operating DLE plant in North America. Initially commissioned in May 2020, the Plant has processed over 16.4 million gallons (62 million litres) of Smackover brine. “The long-term operation of our Demo Plant has been crucial in replicating and understanding the real-world dynamic conditions of continuous commercial-scale operations,” said Dr. Robinson. “With our partner Koch Technology Solutions, we have been able to tailor and optimise the multi-step flowsheet that will allow the Plant to be scaled for commercial production. The knowledge we have on-hand from over four years of operations, combined with an optimised flowsheet and now a commercial-scale DLE column, puts us in a strong position as we continue to advance our projects.” Recent technical highlights of the Demo Plant and the existing LiPRO™ LSS (DLE) column are provided below. Key Findings: Lithium Recovery Efficiency: As a recent weekly snapshot demonstrates (early March 2024), the LiPRO™ LSS (DLE) process achieved an average weekly lithium recovery of 95.9% from the continuous incoming brine flow.Element Rejection Rate: During the same period, the DLE process rejected, on average, over 99.3% of the key contaminants sodium, calcium, magnesium and potassium from the brine (i.e. less than 0.7% of those contaminants made it through the DLE into the first lithium chloride solution); and over 94.2% of boron was rejected.Operational Cycles: The LiPRO™ LSS (DLE) process has completed over 8,585 operational cycles.The LiPRO™ LSS column has been operating with negligible degradation or loss of the sorbent media, and brine pre-treatment has been optimized to allow for foulant-free operation of the DLE step.Brine Processed: As of the end of December 2023 (per Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission reporting), the Demo Plant had processed 16,418,408 gallons (62,143,674 litres) of Smackover brine, produced directly from the formation and reinjected continuously back into the same formation. Dr. Robinson added: “One of the fundamental findings of the Demonstration Plant is the necessity of long-duration, on-site continuous processing of real brine. Our Demo Plant handles real Smackover brine directly from the resource, whereas in traditional small-scale, short-term off-site batch processes, brine is isolated, transported and often undergoes physical and chemical changes before testing. With the commercial-scale LSS column, we can continuously test real brine from the Smackover at a commercial level.” Figure 1 – Commercial-scale DLE column installed at Standard Lithium’s Demonstration Plant near El Dorado, Arkansas.

For the fourth quarter, net sales were USD 2.5 billion, an increase of 10% in constant currencies compared to the same quarter of the prior year. For the full year, net sales were USD 9.6 billion, an increase of 7% in constant currencies compared to the prior year and core EBITDA margin of 18.1%. “2023 was a year of many achievements for Sandoz, thanks to the passion and tireless efforts of our employees worldwide”, said Richard Saynor, Chief Executive Officer of Sandoz. “We launched Hyrimoz® (biosimilar adalimumab) in the US, expanded our biosimilar pipeline through a commercialization agreement with Samsung on biosimilar ustekinumab (reference medicine Stelara®) and enhanced our generic portfolio with the acquisition of Mycamine® (an anti-fungal agent), while becoming an independent public company.” Mr. Saynor continued: “These achievements came alongside strong financial results, with sales growth in all three regions and double-digit growth in biosimilars for the fourth quarter and full year. Our full-year 2023 core EBITDA margin was 18.1%, in line with our guidance despite foreign exchange headwinds, offering a solid basis for our mid-term ambitions. We have also secured long-term financing with two bond issuances and ended the year with a strong cash balance of USD 1.1 billion, providing optionality for future investments. We have entered 2024 with strong momentum and a deep pipeline of products to create sustainable long-term value for our shareholders and society.” FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR 2023 NET SALES RESULTSNet sales for the fourth quarter were USD 2.5 billion, up 10% in constant currencies, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Volume contributed 12 percentage points of growth, partially offset by price erosion of 2 percentage points. All regions showed growth this quarter with solid contribution from generics and strong performance in biosimilars, across new and existing products. Net sales for the full year were USD 9.6 billion, up 7% in constant currencies compared to 2022. Volume contributed 10 percentage points of growth, partially offset by price erosion of 3 percentage points, a significant reduction compared to 6 percentage points in 2022. Growth was driven by strong demand, product launches and continued performance of Omnitrope® and Hyrimoz®.

Growth was driven by volume demand, the acquisition of Mycamine®, an antifungal agent, the transfer of mature brands from our former parent and price erosion below prior year. Net sales for the full year were USD 7.4 billion, up 5% in constant currencies, driven by strong volume demand and recent launches. The first half of the year was particularly strong due to an exceptional cough and cold season and the contribution from apixaban, an anticoagulant medication, in Europe. Biosimilars overviewNet sales for the fourth quarter were USD 623 million, up 26% in constant currencies, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. This strong double digit biosimilar growth reflects the launch of Hyrimoz® high concentration formulation as well as ongoing strong demand for our first ever biosimilar Omnitrope®, where we are the market leader, capturing 34% market share2. Net sales for the full year were USD 2.2 billion, up 15% in constant currencies versus prior year, driven by strong contributions from Omnitrope® and Hyrimoz®.

Net sales for the full year were USD 5.0 billion, up 9% in constant currencies versus prior year, driven by sales related to an extraordinary cough and cold season and demand for new generic launches such as apixaban in the first half of the year, and strong performance of our biosimilars. North America overviewNet sales for the fourth quarter were USD 615 million, up 20% in constant currencies, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Growth was driven by the transfer of mature brands from our former parent and strong demand for Omnitrope®. In addition, we started supplying Hyrimoz® to Cordavis, a wholly owned subsidiary launched by CVS Health, during the quarter to sell under their private label and to expand the reach of Hyrimoz® to patients in the US. Net sales for the full year were USD 2.1 billion, up 3% in constant currencies versus prior year. North America moved from stabilization to growth, driven primarily by strong demand for Omnitrope®, the launch of Hyrimoz® in the US and price erosion lower than in the prior year. International overviewNet sales for the fourth quarter were USD 656 million, up 14% in constant currencies, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. This was primarily a result of strong volume growth, new product launches, such as Mycamine®, and strong demand for our biosimilars. Net sales for the full year were USD 2.5 billion, up 9% in constant currencies versus prior year, driven by strong demand in key markets and growth across the biosimilar portfolio. FULL-YEAR KEY OPERATING RESULTS Twelve months ended December 31 Change % USD millions unless indicated otherwise 2023 2022 USD cc Net sales to third parties 9 647 9 069 6 7 Gross profit 4 564 4 378 4 8 Operating income 375 1 239 (70) (53) EBITDA 914 1 741 (48) (37) Core results Core gross profit 4 913 4 726 4 7 % of net sales to third parties 50.9 52.1 Core operating income 1 488 1 705 (13) (2) % of net sales to third parties 15.4 18.8 Core EBITDA 1 743 1 931 (10) 0 % of net sales to third parties 18.1 21.3 Core net financial result (251) (115) (118) (71) Core income taxes (284) (370) 23 9 Core effective tax rate (%) 23 23 Core net income 953 1 220 (22) (8) Core diluted earnings per share (USD) 2.20 2.83 (22) (8) Core gross profit amounted to USD 4.9 billion compared to USD 4.7 billion in the prior year, resulting in a core gross profit margin of 50.9% compared to 52.1% in 2022. The favorable contribution from volume and product mix were offset by the impact of higher input costs, and a 1.2 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. Core EBITDA was USD 1.7 billion versus 1.9 billion in the prior year, resulting in a core EBITDA margin of 18.1% compared to 21.3% in 2022. Contribution from higher sales were more than offset by higher input costs as expected, investments in sales and marketing to support our new product launches, standalone costs of 1.3 percentage points, and a 1.7 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange. EBITDA was USD 914 million versus 1.7 billion in the prior year. Core adjustments for EBITDA in 2023 were USD 829 million compared to USD 190 million in 2022, driven by legal costs of USD 576 million, separation costs of USD 155 million and rationalization of manufacturing sites and other of USD 98 million. Legal costs included the settlement agreement with the class of direct purchaser plaintiffs in the US multidistrict antitrust litigation that was announced on February 29, 2024. As a new public company, this settlement underscores our commitment to integrity and sound governance and is an encouraging step toward putting allegations of legacy conduct behind us. Core net financial result was an expense of USD 251 million compared to an expense of USD 115 million in 2022. The increase was primarily a result of interest expenses related to financing from our former parent prior to the spin-off, financing facilities put in place at the separation and the bond issues in the fourth quarter. The core effective tax rate was 23%, in line with prior year. Core net income was USD 1.0 billion compared to USD 1.2 billion in 2022 mainly driven by lower core EBITDA and higher interest expense, partly offset by lower income tax. Core diluted earnings per share was USD 2.20 with a weighted average number of shares of 431.2 million. NET CASH FLOW, WORKING CAPITAL AND NET DEBTTotal cash and cash equivalents increased to USD 1.1 billion on December 31, 2023, compared to USD 0.1 billion on December 31, 2022. The increase resulted from the opening cash at separation, combined with the net proceeds from the fourth quarter bond issues after refinancing of the bridge loan. The company generated net cash flows from operating activities of USD 0.4 billion, compared with USD 1.2 billion in the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in net working capital, separation costs, a legal settlement and manufacturing optimization. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to an increase in inventory of USD 0.6 billion to USD 2.7 billion, with USD 0.2 billion supporting the strong topline growth of the business, USD 0.2 billion from higher input costs and USD 0.2 billion due to the transfer of inventories from our former parent at the separation and additional quantities to ensure operational continuity post spin. Net CAPEX was USD 586 million, compared with USD 386 million in the prior year. This increase is mainly due to the acquisitions of intangible assets such as Mycamine® and investments in development and manufacturing sites in Germany and Slovenia. Free cash flow amounted to a negative USD 234 million, compared with USD 832 million in the prior year, due primarily to lower cash flow from operating activities and higher net CAPEX. Immediately prior to the separation and spin-off from its former parent, Sandoz entered into a credit facility agreement. This borrowing arrangement consisted of an unsecured bridge facility for USD 2.6 billion, multiple term loans for USD 0.8 billion and a revolving credit facility for USD 1.25 billion. The company received investment grade credit ratings from Moody’s and S&P of Baa2 and BBB, respectively, placing the company in a strong position. Post spin, the company successfully issued both CHF senior notes of CHF 750 million and EUR senior notes of EUR 2.0 billion with maturities ranging from 2026 to 2033. Proceeds were used to refinance the bridge facility and for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2023, Sandoz maturity profile is well balanced with an average maturity of non-current financial debt of approximately 5 years. As a result, the weighted average interest rate on total non-current financial debt was 3.9% in 2023. Net debt remained largely constant at USD 3.1 billion on December 31, 2023, compared to USD 3.0 billion on December 31, 2022, corresponding to a net debt to core EBITDA ratio of 1.8x. DIVIDENDThe Board of Directors is recommending a dividend of CHF 0.45 per share representing 24% of core net income in line with our guidance. Shareholders will vote on this proposal at the Annual General Meeting on April 30, 2024. GUIDANCE 2024For full-year 2024, the company expects net sales to grow mid-single digit in constant currencies versus prior year, and core EBITDA margin around 20%. MID-TERM GUIDANCE 2028The company is reaffirming its mid-term guidance to 2028. The company expects net sales to grow annually by mid-single digit in constant currencies and core EBITDA margin in the range of 24% to 26%. Dividend is expected to be 30% to 40% of full-year core net income. ANNUAL REPORTThe company published its 2023 integrated Annual Report today, which can be found at Integrated Annual Report.

Despite the use of these measures by management in setting goals and measuring Sandoz performance, these are non-IFRS measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS Accounting Standards. As a result, such measures have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, the non-IFRS measures (unlike IFRS measures) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. These non-IFRS measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how Sandoz management assesses underlying performance. These non-IFRS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for IFRS measures, and should be viewed in conjunction with IFRS financials. As an internal measure of Group performance, these non-IFRS measures have limitations, and Sandoz performance management process is not solely restricted to these metrics. The definitions of the non-IFRS financial metrics as used by Sandoz are as follows: Core resultsSandoz core results – including core EBITDA, core operating income, core net income and core earnings per share – exclude fully: The amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets other than software;Net gains and losses on fund investments and equity securities valued at fair value through profit and loss;Certain acquisition and divestment- related items;Tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions. The following items that exceed a threshold of USD 25 million are also excluded: Integration- and divestment- related income and expenses;Divestment gains and losses;Restructuring charges/releases and related items;Legal related items;Impairments of property, plant and equipment, software and financial assets;And income and expense items that management deems exceptional and that are or are expected to accumulate within the year to be over a USD 25 million threshold. Income tax impacts of such items are also excluded from core measures. Sandoz believes that investor understanding of its performance is enhanced by disclosing core measures of performance because, since core measures exclude items that can vary significantly from year to year, they enable a better comparison of business performance across years. For this same reason, Sandoz uses these core measures in addition to IFRS and other measures as important factors in assessing its performance. The following are examples of how these core measures are utilized: In addition to monthly reports containing financial information prepared under IFRS, senior management receives a monthly analysis incorporating these core measures;Annual budgets are prepared for both IFRS and core measures. As an internal measure of Sandoz performance, the core results measures have limitations, and the Sandoz performance management process is not solely restricted to these metrics. A limitation of the core results measures is that they provide a view of the Sandoz operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition, divestment, or amortization/impairments of purchased intangible assets, impairments to property, plant and equipment and restructurings and related items. Constant currenciesChanges in the relative values of non-US currencies to the US dollar can affect Sandoz financial results and financial position. To provide additional information that may be useful to investors, including changes in sales volume, Sandoz presents information about its net sales and various values relating to operating and net income that are adjusted for such foreign currency effects. Constant currency calculations have the goal of eliminating two exchange rate effects so that an estimate can be made of underlying changes in the consolidated income statement excluding the impact of fluctuations in exchanges rates: The impact of translating the income statements of consolidated entities from their non-USD functional currencies to USD;The impact of exchange rate movements on the major transactions of consolidated entities performed in currencies other than their functional currency. Sandoz calculates constant currency measures by translating the current year’s foreign currency values for sales and other income statement items into USD (excluding the IAS 29 “Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies” adjustments to the local currency income statements of subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary economies), using the average exchange rates from the prior year and comparing them to the prior year values in USD. Sandoz uses these constant currency measures in evaluating its performance, since they may assist the Group in evaluating its ongoing performance from year to year. However, in performing its evaluation, Sandoz also considers equivalent measures of performance that are not affected by changes in the relative value of currencies. Growth rate calculationFor ease of understanding, Sandoz uses a sign convention for its growth rates such that a reduction in operating expenses or losses compared to the prior year is considered favorable and hence shown as a positive change (growth). Net financial resultSandoz defines net financial result as interest expense and other financial income and expense. EBITDASandoz defines earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) as operating income, excluding depreciation of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets, amortization of intangible assets, impairments of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, and intangible assets. Core EBITDA marginSandoz defines core EBITDA margin as the percentage of core EBITDA over net sales to third parties. It is an indicator to measure the profitability of the Group. Free cash flowSandoz defines free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities and cash flows from investing activities associated with the purchase or sale of property, plant and equipment, of intangible assets, of financial assets and of other non-current assets. Excluded from free cash flow are cash flows from investing activities associated with acquisitions and divestments of businesses and of interests in associated companies, purchases and sales of marketable securities, commodities, time deposits and net cash flows from financing activities. Free cash flow is a non-IFRS measure and is not intended to be a substitute measure for net cash flows from operating activities as determined under IFRS. Free cash flow is presented as additional information because management believes it is a useful supplemental indicator of the Sandoz ability to operate without reliance on additional borrowing or use of existing cash. Free cash flow is a measure of the net cash generated that is available for investment in strategic opportunities, returning to shareholders and for debt repayment. Free cash flow is a non-IFRS measure, which means it should not be interpreted as a measure determined under IFRS. Net working capitalSandoz defines net working capital as inventory and trade receivables, net of trade payables. Net CAPEXSandoz defines net CAPEX as cash outflows from purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, net of proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Sandoz presents net CAPEX as a positive number.

The project generates 100GWh annually, reducing 20,000 tonnes of CO2e per year and covering electricity needs for offices, manufacturing facilities, and RD&E centers. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The completion of the Mörknässkogen windfarm project by Ecolab, in partnership with Low Carbon, signifies a major advancement in Ecolab's sustainable energy initiatives. The windfarm's 30MW capacity and projected annual generation of 100GWh not only contribute to the local energy infrastructure but also demonstrate a growing trend in corporate renewable energy procurement. The shift towards renewable energy sourcing, particularly through Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (VPPAs), reflects a broader movement within the energy sector where companies are not only seeking to reduce their carbon footprint but also to hedge against future energy price volatility.From a business perspective, this transition to renewable energy can lead to cost savings over time due to the reduction in exposure to fluctuating fossil fuel prices. Furthermore, the emphasis on sustainability can enhance Ecolab's brand reputation and potentially lead to a competitive advantage as customers and investors increasingly favor environmentally responsible companies. However, it is important to monitor the operational efficiency of these renewable assets and the long-term fixed costs associated with VPPAs, which could impact financial performance if market conditions shift unfavorably. Sustainability Consultant Ecolab's achievement of powering 100% of its European operations with renewable energy is a clear indication of the company's commitment to its 2030 Impact Goals. The environmental benefits, such as the avoidance of 20,000 tonnes of CO2e per year, align with global efforts to combat climate change and meet the targets set by international agreements like the Paris Agreement. The company's proactive approach to sustainability not only supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) but also positions Ecolab as a leader in corporate responsibility within its industry.However, the long-term success of such sustainability initiatives often hinges on their integration into the core business strategy. It is essential to evaluate the return on investment from these green projects, considering both tangible and intangible benefits. While the immediate environmental impact is positive, the full implications for shareholder value will unfold over time, factoring in potential regulatory changes, market demand for green products and the evolving landscape of corporate sustainability reporting. Market Research Analyst The renewable energy sector is witnessing a surge in corporate demand, which is reflected in Ecolab's strategic investments in wind energy projects. The company's progress towards its goal of 100% renewable electricity by 2030 places it ahead of the curve compared to the RE100 initiative's 2050 target. Such early adoption of renewable energy solutions may influence industry peers and stimulate further growth in the renewable energy market. The impact on Ecolab's market position could be significant, as sustainability becomes an increasingly important factor in business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) relationships.While Ecolab's advancements are commendable, it is crucial to assess the scalability of these initiatives across different regions and the potential challenges in markets with less developed renewable energy infrastructure. The company's approach may serve as a case study for best practices in corporate renewable energy sourcing, potentially influencing policy and investment in the sector. The ripple effect of Ecolab's actions on the stock market and the business landscape at large could be substantial, particularly as investors are showing greater interest in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria when making investment decisions. 03/13/2024 - 04:00 AM Virtual Power Purchase Agreement with Low Carbon helps take Ecolab’s global renewable electricity sourcing to 80% ST. PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ecolab Inc., a global sustainability leader offering water, hygiene and infection prevention solutions and services that protect people and the resources vital to life, today announced the successful sourcing of enough clean electricity to power 100% of its European operations, thanks to the completion of a windfarm project with the global renewable energy company, Low Carbon. In 2022, Ecolab and Low Carbon entered into an agreement to develop the Mörknässkogen windfarm, located on the west coast of Finland near the city of Vaasa. Now, the windfarm has reached full commercial operation, and its 30MW capacity will generate approximately 100GWh of electricity annually. That’s enough to power 30,000 homes and avoid 20,000 tonnes of CO2e per year. By sourcing the power produced by the windfarm, Ecolab will cover 100% of the electricity used across all its European sites, including 15 major offices, 26 manufacturing facilities and seven RD&E centers. This achievement elevates the company’s global renewable electricity sourcing level to 80%, marking a significant stride in Ecolab’s journey to achieving 100% renewable electricity globally by 2030, a key component of Ecolab’s 2030 Impact Goals. ""We believe that truly sustainable companies deliver on both their financial and environmental goals,” said Christophe Beck, Chairman and CEO, Ecolab. “By achieving this milestone in Europe, we'll be sourcing the renewable energy needed to power our operations and as we electrify our vehicle fleet. These efforts support our continued growth and ability to serve customers, all while moving us closer to our 2030 Impact Goals and a 100% positive future."" “We are delighted to see Low Carbon’s first Finnish wind project enter operations, which is a major milestone as we look to increase the amount of renewable energy capacity globally,” said John Isherwood, Managing Director at Low Carbon. “The 10-year PPA with our Ecolab partners underlines our shared vision for a world that is powered by renewables and will make a vital contribution to Finland’s supply of clean, secure energy.” This latest renewable power milestone builds on Ecolab’s progress in North America, where the company reached 100% renewable electricity in 2020 as a result of its 2018 investment in the Mesquite Star windfarm in Texas and 2015 investment in a local community solar garden project in Minnesota. As the electrical grids in major markets become greener, Ecolab’s virtual Power Purchase Agreements in North America and Europe account for the company’s transition to electric vehicles. Ecolab recently announced accelerated efforts to electrify its sales and service fleet in North America by 2030. Ecolab’s Power Purchase Agreements and its other initiatives put the company on pace to achieve its renewable electricity targets by 2030. That’s well ahead of guidelines outlined by RE100, a global corporate initiative focused on achieving 100% renewable electricity by 2050, of which Ecolab is a member.

The long-term implications may include a redefinition of art ownership and the democratization of investment in high-value art pieces. 03/13/2024 - 02:00 AM Geneva, Switzerland / Florence, Italy , March 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Building upon the successful announcement at Davos earlier this year, WISeKey International Holding Ltd (“WISeKey”) (SIX: WIHN, NASDAQ: WKEY), a forefront leader in cybersecurity, digital identity, and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, is excited to announce the next phase of its groundbreaking initiative to digitalize over $500 million worth of Italian Renaissance Art under the ownership of GMA. This initiative is a collaboration between WISeKey’s subsidiary, WISe.Art, and the GMA, targeting the digitalization of masterpieces by Caravaggio, Beato Angelico, Tiziano, Tintoretto, Rubens, Rembrandt, Verocchio, and Raffaello di Sanzio. By transforming these timeless treasures into digital form, the project aims to extend the reach of Italian artistic heritage globally, making it accessible beyond the confines of museums and private collections. Revolutionizing Art and Investment with the Renaissance CoinA cornerstone of this initiative is the introduction of the Renaissance Coin, a pioneering development in the art investment sphere. These Artistic Security Tokens, differing fundamentally from Bitcoins and NFTs, operate within a regulated framework, offering a secure and legally compliant option for art investors. The tokens represent a unique convergence of physical artworks and their digital counterparts, honoring the essence of these masterpieces while providing an innovative investment opportunity. An exclusive event set for July 14 in Florence will mark the launch of the pre-registration phase, featuring a remarkable presentation of Renaissance digital art by the renowned artist Pedro Sandoval. Technological Innovation and Security at the HeartAt the core of this endeavor is the WISe.ART platform, which employs cutting-edge blockchain technology, including NFTs on the Hedera blockchain, to create a secure, efficient, and transparent marketplace for trading luxury collectibles and artworks. The platform thoughtfully balances the need for Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations with the desire for user anonymity, facilitated by the TrustECoin token set to launch in May, enabling discreet yet compliant NFT trading. With over two decades of experience in security and object authentication, WISeKey ensures the utmost security and authenticity for artworks and their digital versions, minimizing the risk of digital counterfeiting. Strategic partnerships, including those with Hedera and GMA, underscore WISeKey’s unique position in the market, enhancing its capabilities in crypto expertise and innovative data offerings.The Hashgraph Association (THA), the non-profit Swiss organization behind the innovative distributed ledger technology (DLT) of Hedera Hashgraph (“Hedera”), announced a groundbreaking collaboration during the Davos 2024 event. This joint initiative focuses on the legal and regulatory compliant tokenization of art assets and equity-shares of WISe.Art AG. The centerpiece of WISe.Art is the WISe.Art Marketplace built to redefine the way art is bought and sold, bringing transparency, security, authenticity, legal certainty, and fractional ownership to the forefront of the global art world. Leveraging WISeKey's 25 years of proven expertise in cybersecurity and cryptography, the platform introduces a novel approach to art transactions and digital representation, ensuring a seamless and trustworthy experience of value exchange for artists, collectors, and enthusiasts. In collaboration with artists, collectors, museums, and prestigious galleries, WISe.ART and GMA are thrilled to present the ‘Digital Renaissance Project Italy.’ From 2024 to the Jubilee year 2025, this ambitious project will digitize the Italian Renaissance artistic heritage, using ultra-high-definition imagery and digital enhancements. This effort is a milestone in transitioning Italian artistic heritage into the digital age, extending its reach to a global audience. As part of the initiative, an exclusive Renaissance Coin will be launched, providing access to historic art treasures through WISe.ART. This project connects art enthusiasts worldwide via the Internet, allowing them to immerse in and admire this extraordinary artistic heritage, some of which were previously limited to museums and historical sites. This technological breakthrough enables these treasures to be viewed and appreciated globally.

Negative None. 03/13/2024 - 04:00 AM The project is endorsed by Kunihiko Morinaga of ANREALAGE, a globally recognized Japanese apparel designer who regularly appears at Paris Fashion Week. KYOTO, Japan, March 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- In 2023, Kyocera Corporation released its new sustainable inkjet textile printer, ""FOREARTH"" *1, which reduces the water usage for textile printing to virtually zero in order to solve environmental issues, such as water pollution, in the textile and apparel industry. The new 'TRUE BLUE TEXTILE' project based on a 'Wear to Save Water' fashion concept was launched to promote consumer awareness of environmental issues and features textile design exhibits by Anrealage and Vantan Design Institute to be held on Friday, March 22 to Sunday, March 24 to coincide with World Water Day 2024. *1 Printing of patterns on fabrics. 'TRUE BLUE TEXTILE' promotes a new 'Wear to Save Water' fashion concept that encourages consumers to learn and think about the environmental issues in the textile and apparel industry by wearing sustainable fashion. 'TRUE BLUE TEXTILE' fabric was printed by Kyocera's FOREARTH water free concept digital inkjet printer with patterns based on the Niyodo River in Kochi Prefecture, which boasts the best water quality in Japan. A total of five outfits were produced for the project by ANREALAGE - a company founded by Kunihiko Morinaga, who endorsed the aims of this project - and the Vantan Design Institute, which has produced numerous globally renowned designers. Through these initiatives, Kyocera is committed to tackling environmental issues affecting the textile and apparel industry. About the 'TRUE BLUE TEXTILE' ProjectUntil now, the textile and apparel industry has used vast amounts of water in processes such as steam and washing when dyeing fabrics, and water pollution resulting from this wastewater has become a global environmental problem. In addition, the problem of mass disposal due to overstocking is also under scrutiny, requiring an immediate response. To help address these issues, Kyocera has developed the new FOREARTH inkjet textile printer, which reduces water use to the absolute minimum by combining inkjet technology for high-speed, high-quality printing with the ink and equipment development technology of Kyocera Document Solutions. The 'TRUE BLUE TEXTILE' project is an initiative to nudge people to think about the significance of 'Wear to Save Water' by choosing garments with sustainable fabrics. 'TRUE BLUE TEXTILE' Concept MovieExploring the question, 'What if we could protect water by wearing beautiful clothes?' - this video is designed to help people learn about environmental issues in the textile and apparel industry and to think about the future.URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uJjs6vDcoA 'TRUE BLUE TEXTILE' is printed using FOREARTH, featuring the surface of the Niyodo River in Kochi Prefecture, which has been voted the river with the best water in Japan eight times in ten years*2 in a nationwide first-class river water quality survey conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism. Donning these garments allows the wearer to both protect beautiful water by wearing beautiful clothes and express their willingness to protect the environment and save the future of water. More details on the 'TRUE BLUE TEXTILE' Projecthttps://www.kyocera.co.jp/truebluetextile/ *2 Water quality status of first-class rivers in Japan, published by MLIT (2012-2016 and 2018-2020). 'TRUE BLUE TEXTILE' Project Realized with Collaboration by Leading Designers in the Japanese Apparel IndustryFor the launch of 'TRUE BLUE TEXTILE,' dresses were created by ANREALAGE, the brand established by Kunihiko Morinaga and budding designers at leading Japanese design school Vantan Design Institute, which is also Morinaga's alma mater. Kunihiko Morinaga (ANREALAGE) Design ConceptMorinaga's 'Water Drop Collection' is an earth-shaped garment inspired by a drop of water in circulation. The water cycle begins with a single drop. It takes the form of the first drop of seawater or water on the earth's surface that evaporates, becomes clouds in the sky, and eventually turns into rain or snow. This epitomizes the 'FOREARTH' concept, which reduces water consumption by 99% *3 compared to conventional textile printing. *3 According to research by Kyocera (2022) Vantan Design Institute Design Concept'Water Metamorphose' is fashion inspired by the movement of water, created by a fresh new emerging talent. Water changes its form depending on temperature and conditions. It sometimes comes down in gentle waves and sometimes in torrents as rain that benefits us all. There is also the strength and beauty of the ever-changing appearance of water as it freezes taut and eventually melts and flows; this constantly changing nature is perhaps precisely why water fascinates us so much. Vantan's designs explore water's constantly shifting forms in three design types: wave, waterfall, and ice.

This contributes to a significant reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Furthermore, the system provides a soft feel to the fabric, which is important in the textile and apparel industry, and realizes high-definition printing on a wide variety of fabrics, including cotton, silk, polyester, nylon, and blended fabrics.

(GEHC) announced the pricing of a secondary underwritten public offering of 14,000,000 shares of its common stock, upsized from the initial offering size of 13,000,000 shares. General Electric Company (GE) is expected to exchange the GEHC shares for indebtedness held by Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. The offering is managed by Morgan Stanley with an option for additional shares to be purchased. The offering is set to close on March 15, 2024, subject to closing conditions. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The upsizing of the secondary underwritten public offering from 13 million to 14 million shares by GE HealthCare Technologies indicates a potentially higher demand or a strategic move to increase liquidity. Such an offering often leads to dilution of existing shareholders' equity, but in this case, since GE HealthCare is not selling any new shares, the dilution effect is neutralized. Instead, the exchange of shares for debt held by Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. is a critical aspect to consider.This transaction could signify a deleveraging strategy by General Electric, which may positively influence GE's balance sheet by reducing its debt burden. Investors and analysts should closely monitor the impact of this debt-for-equity swap on GE's financial leverage ratios and overall financial health. The market's response to this offering could serve as a barometer for investor confidence in GE HealthCare's future prospects and GE's financial restructuring efforts. Financial Analyst The granting of an option to the underwriter to purchase additional shares by March 28, 2024, introduces a potential future cash inflow for the selling stockholder but also adds a layer of uncertainty regarding the stock's future price. The transaction's structure, involving a debt-for-equity exchange followed by a secondary offering, is a sophisticated financial maneuver that may impact the stock's volatility in the short term.Investors should evaluate the terms of the offering, as detailed in the final prospectus supplement, to understand the implications for share price and liquidity. The timing and pricing strategy of selling the shares on the open market or through negotiated transactions could also signal the company's and underwriter's confidence in the stock's valuation and market conditions. Legal Expert The offering is being conducted under an automatically effective shelf registration statement, which provides GE HealthCare with the flexibility to sell securities over a prolonged period.

The company enters Chapter 11 proceedings to implement the plan, ensuring continued operations and completion of projects. Existing equity holders may receive 5% common equity post-restructuring. Positive Enviva's restructuring plan aims to reduce debt by approximately $1.0 billion, improve profitability, and strengthen liquidity. The company has secured commitments for $500 million in debtor-in-possession financing to support operations during the restructuring process. Enviva plans to continue constructing its Epes plant, with an expected in-service date in the first half of 2025. Existing equity holders may receive 5% of the reorganized company's common equity at exit from Chapter 11 proceedings, with warrants for an additional 5%. Enviva anticipates the continued listing of its common stock on the NYSE throughout the restructuring process. Negative None. Financial Analyst Enviva's announcement of a pre-arranged restructuring plan under Chapter 11 proceedings is a significant step towards addressing its financial challenges. The plan to reduce debt by approximately $1.0 billion will likely alleviate the immediate pressure on the balance sheet, potentially improving the company's debt-to-equity ratio and interest coverage metrics. This, in turn, could enhance creditworthiness and investor confidence. However, the dilution of existing equity holders to 5% of the common equity, with an additional 5% available through warrants, suggests current shareholders will experience substantial dilution. The potential long-term benefit is the improved capital structure which may position Enviva for sustainable growth in the wood-based biomass industry—a sector with increasing relevance due to global energy transition trends.The commitment for $500 million in debtor-in-possession financing is critical, as it provides the liquidity needed to maintain operations and complete strategic projects like the Epes plant. This indicates a level of creditor confidence in Enviva's core business and restructuring plan. Investors should monitor the execution of the restructuring plan and the company's ability to meet the NYSE's continued listing standards, as failure to do so could lead to further stock volatility. Market Research Analyst The wood-based biomass industry, where Enviva operates, is anticipated to grow due to its role in renewable energy production and as an alternative to fossil fuels. Enviva's restructuring could therefore be seen as a strategic move to capitalize on future market opportunities. The pause in the development of the Bond project reflects a strategic prioritization of resources, which may be prudent given the current financial constraints. However, it also indicates a potential slowdown in capacity expansion, which could impact Enviva's market share and competitive positioning in the long term.Stakeholders should consider the broader implications of Enviva's financial restructuring on the industry. A successfully restructured Enviva could emerge as a more competitive player with a lower cost base and improved profitability. Conversely, delays or complications in the restructuring process could provide opportunities for competitors to capture market share. The industry's response to Enviva's restructuring, including potential mergers and acquisitions activity, will be an important trend to follow. Legal Expert The voluntary Chapter 11 proceedings initiated by Enviva will involve a complex legal process, including Court approvals for the debtor-in-possession financing and the restructuring support agreements. The outcome of these proceedings will have significant implications for all stakeholders, including creditors, shareholders and employees. The legal framework provides Enviva with the opportunity to reorganize its debts and emerge from bankruptcy with a healthier financial structure, but the process is subject to uncertainties and risks.From a legal perspective, the 'first-day' motions are standard practice in Chapter 11 cases to facilitate business continuity. If approved, they will enable Enviva to honor its commitments to suppliers and maintain operational stability. The proposed equity distribution to existing shareholders and the issuance of warrants are mechanisms to retain some value for current investors, although this is often seen as a concession in restructuring scenarios. Legal scrutiny will be concentrated on the fairness and legality of these proposals, ensuring they comply with bankruptcy laws and protect the rights of all parties involved. 03/12/2024 - 10:33 PM -- Restructuring Plan Expected to Reduce Debt by Approximately $1.0 Billion, Improve Profitability, and Better Position the Business for Long-Term Success -- -- Company Commences Voluntary Chapter 11 Proceedings to Implement Pre-Arranged Restructuring Plan -- -- Company Secures Commitment for $500 Million in Debtor-in-Possession Financing -- -- Enviva Continues Operations while Advancing its Transformation Plan -- BETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Enviva Inc. (NYSE: EVA) (“Enviva” or the “Company”), a leading producer of sustainably sourced wood-based biomass, today announced that it has entered into two Restructuring Support Agreements (“RSAs”): one RSA with an ad hoc group of holders (the “Ad Hoc Group”) representing approximately 72% of its senior secured credit facility, approximately 95% of its 2026 senior notes, approximately 78% of bonds related to its Epes, Alabama plant currently under construction (“Epes”), and approximately 45% of bonds related to its greenfield project near Bond, Mississippi (“Bond”), and a second RSA with certain holders representing more than 92% of bonds related to the Bond project. The RSAs have broad support across the Company’s capital structure and are designed to support an expedited restructuring to reduce the Company’s debt by approximately $1.0 billion, as well as improve profitability, strengthen liquidity, and better position the business for long-term success as the world’s largest producer of industrial wood pellets. To implement this pre-arranged restructuring, Enviva and certain of its subsidiaries have commenced voluntary Chapter 11 proceedings in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (the “Court”). The Company has also secured commitments for $500 million in debtor-in-possession financing (“DIP Facility”) and other financing accommodations from the Ad Hoc Group, a portion of which will be allocated by the Company to eligible stockholders in accordance with a syndication process that is subject to Court approval. The DIP Facility is expected to provide, subject to Court approval, sufficient liquidity to support continued operations across Enviva’s business throughout the restructuring process, as well as help fund the completion of Epes. Glenn Nunziata, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer commented, “These agreements with our lenders and noteholders represent a significant milestone in the ongoing process to transform our business, as we focus on improving profitability, reducing costs, enhancing asset productivity, and optimizing our capital structure. We look forward to emerging from this process as a stronger company with a solid financial foundation and better positioned to be a leader in the future growth of the wood-based biomass industry. We appreciate the support of our lenders, our vendors, and our customers, and the tremendous efforts of our entire team as we continue to execute our transformation plan.” The Company is filing with the Court several customary “first-day” motions. These motions, which Enviva expects to be approved in short order, are expected to help facilitate a smooth transition into Chapter 11. Enviva expects to continue to pay suppliers in the ordinary course for authorized goods received and services provided after the filing. The restructuring is targeted to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2024, and throughout the process, Enviva plans to continue constructing its Epes plant, with an in-service date expected to be during the first half of 2025. The Company also announced plans to pause development of Bond. The Company intends to revisit restarting Bond, depending on the level of customer contracting, once it emerges from its in-court restructuring process. The terms of the RSA with the Ad Hoc Group provide for existing equity holders to receive (i) 5% of the common equity of the reorganized company at exit from Chapter 11 proceedings and (ii) warrants to purchase an additional 5% of the reorganized equity, both subject to dilution from shares issued in connection with, among other sources, a contemplated equity rights offering, equity participation election rights for creditors under the DIP Facility, and a management incentive plan, in each case, subject to Court approval. Enviva has been in contact with the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) and anticipates the continued listing of its common stock on the NYSE throughout the restructuring process so long as the Company continues to meet the minimum continued listing standards set forth by the NYSE. Additional information about Enviva’s restructuring process and proceedings is available at www.kccllc.net/Enviva.

Enviva sells most of its wood pellets through long-term, take-or-pay off-take contracts with customers located primarily in the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Japan, helping to accelerate the energy transition away from conventional energy sources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions on a lifecycle basis in hard-to-abate sectors like steel, cement, lime, chemicals, and aviation. Enviva exports its wood pellets to global markets through its deep-water marine terminals at the Port of Chesapeake, Virginia, the Port of Wilmington, North Carolina, and the Port of Pascagoula, Mississippi, and from third-party deep-water marine terminals in Savannah, Georgia, Mobile, Alabama, and Panama City, Florida.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Society for Science (the Society) announced that Achyuta Rajaram, 17, of Exeter, NH, won the top award in the Regeneron Science Talent Search (STS) 2024, America’s oldest and most prestigious science and math competition for high school seniors. The competition, now in its 83rd year, has consistently identified young innovators who become tomorrow’s STEM leaders. The 2024 finalists demonstrated extensive scientific knowledge through research and interviews while showcasing their commitment to addressing societal issues, passion for discovery, noteworthy leadership and community involvement. Forty finalists, including Achyuta, were honored this evening during an award ceremony emceed by American Broadcaster Soledad O'Brien. More than $1.8 million was awarded to the finalists, who were selected from among the largest entrant pool since the 1960s through a holistic evaluation process. Achyuta Rajaram won first place and $250,000 for developing an automatic method to discover which parts of a computer model are involved in decision-making. This knowledge sheds light on what these algorithms are “thinking,” which can help make them more effective, fair and safe. Second place and $175,000 went to Thomas Cong, 17, of Ossining, NY for investigating the rapid growth of certain cancers and whether information controlling metabolism is primarily controlled by the expression of genetic information. He found that immune cancers have pronounced differences in metabolism and gene expression, which suggests that a more complex landscape of metabolic variation exists and gives further insight into cancer studies. Third place and $150,000 went to Michelle Wei, 17, of San Jose, CA for finding that second-order cone programming problems can be solved more quickly than previously thought by converting the original problem into a modified form. Problems of this type appear frequently in areas ranging from supply chain optimization to electrical power distribution to financial portfolio management or machine learning, and she hopes her research may lead to process optimizations across various industries. “Congratulations to the winners of this year’s Regeneron Science Talent Search,” said Maya Ajmera, President and CEO, Society for Science and Executive Publisher, Science News. “The remarkable intellect and ingenuity of these students serves as an inspiration for us all. Their groundbreaking innovations are vital in uncovering the crucial solutions we need now to address our most intractable challenges.” The Regeneron Science Talent Search empowers young people who are passionate about innovation and using scientific discovery to contribute to improving our world. By providing a national stage to present new ideas and challenge old ways of thinking, the competition encourages and rewards a culture of idea sharing, critical thinking and continuous improvement. It also serves as a catalyst to discovering sustainable solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges. The judging panel considers how these research endeavors, innovative thinking and leadership qualities demonstrate the students’ potential to become future leaders in critical STEM fields. “Congratulations to the winners of this year’s Regeneron Science Talent Search and to all the brilliant finalists,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., co-Founder, Board co-Chair, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron, and a top winner in the 1976 STS. “My own participation in the Science Talent Search during my high school years sparked a lifelong commitment to science and set me on my path of inventing and developing new medicines for previously untreatable diseases. Our finalists are only beginning their journeys, and their extraordinary achievements at such a young age give me hope that they will go on to deliver major innovative breakthroughs that will greatly benefit humanity.” Other top honors from the competition include: Fourth Place: Nathan Wei, 17, of Gainesville, FL received a $100,000 award for developing a more sustainable way to create strong and durable plastic polymers that are also recyclable. He believes this approach should also work with biologically based raw materials, which would make the process even more sustainable. Fifth Place: Zeyneb Kaya, 17, of Saratoga, CA received a $90,000 award for creating a natural language processing algorithm, similar to ChatGPT, that could help preserve endangered languages. She found a way to enhance the small training datasets of lesser-known languages by creating accurate translation pairs of words to generate grammatically correct sentences. Sixth Place: Christopher Zorn, 17, of Irvington, NY received a $80,000 award for investigating the relationship between RET, a gene involved in cellular signals, and MYC, a set of genes that regulate cell growth and death. He created genetically altered lung cancer cell lines, exposed them to various drugs and measured the MYC protein levels, which appeared at elevated levels and were shown to lead to treatment resistance. His findings suggest paths for further drug research targeting both RET and MYC. Seventh Place: Ella Pilacek, 17, of Oviedo, FL received a $70,000 award for researching ways to teach non-native honeybees how to pollinate an endangered native species of orchid. By mixing the compounds of the flower’s scent with a sugar solution that bees naturally love, Ella was successfully able to train the bees to be attracted to the scent, potentially making increased pollination and species survival more likely. Eighth Place: Selina Zhang, 18, of Annandale, NJ received a $60,000 award for designing and field-testing an eco-conscious, A.I.-powered artificial tree that uses machine learning to selectively lure, identify and kill the destructive and invasive spotted lanternfly. Her eco-friendly prototype tree cost her just under $200 to build and she hopes it may be a useful tool in controlling invasive species. Ninth Place: Arnav Chakravarthy, 18, of Cupertino, CA received a $50,000 award for comparing the genetic origins of a type of immune cell, known as macrophages, in the brain, liver and bone marrow to learn more about how they replenish themselves. Most cells could be traced back to their embryonic beginnings, however, Arnav found evidence that certain brain cells may also be replenished from our bone marrow as we age. His findings may shed light on future targeted therapies for age-related diseases like Alzheimer’s. Tenth Place: Alan Bu, 17, of Exeter, NH, received a $40,000 award for a math project that gave precise limits on how many spanning trees a planar graph can have. A spanning tree is the connecting point of vertices in a graph. His key insight was to connect the spanning tree counting problem to a separate problem in linear algebra, a different field of math, which he could then attack. His results shed light on the structure of planar graphs. Aditi Avinash, 17, of Highlands Ranch, CO, was named the Seaborg Award winner and given the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Regeneron Science Talent Search Class of 2024. The 40 finalists chose Aditi as the student who most exemplifies their class and the extraordinary attributes of nuclear chemist Glenn T. Seaborg, who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1951 and served on the Society’s Board of Trustees for 30 years. All other finalists received $25,000. All 40 finalists will join the ranks of other STS alumni, many of whom have gone on to have world-changing careers in STEM fields, and some of whom have earned the most esteemed honors in science and math, including the Nobel Prize, National Medal of Science and MacArthur Foundation Fellowships. In total, Regeneron awarded $3.1 million in prizes through the Regeneron Science Talent Search 2024, including $2,000 to each of the top 300 scholars and their schools.

With the PROTECTED level clearance, Confluent can now offer its data streaming services across major cloud providers to more government agencies, which could lead to an expansion of its customer base in this region.From a market research perspective, this development is noteworthy as it represents an increased trust and reliance on cloud-based data services by government bodies, a sector known for stringent security requirements. The potential for increased adoption of Confluent's platform may drive revenue growth and could position the company as a preferred partner for government digital transformation initiatives. Moreover, the recognition by Forrester as a leader in Cloud Data Pipelines and Streaming Data Platforms indicates that Confluent's offerings are well-regarded in the industry, which may positively influence investor perception and stock valuation. Cybersecurity Expert Confluent's emphasis on meeting the Australian Signals Directorate's PROTECTED standards is a pivotal step in addressing the complex cybersecurity challenges faced by government agencies. This achievement not only enhances Confluent's reputation for data security and compliance but also assures potential government clients of the platform's ability to handle sensitive information securely. Given the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyber threats, government agencies are under immense pressure to adopt secure and resilient data streaming solutions.For stakeholders, the long-term benefits include potentially reduced risk of data breaches and improved data governance. The Stream Governance suite, in particular, aligns with the global trend towards stringent data regulation compliance, offering a proactive approach to data management that could become a benchmark in the industry. This could lead to a competitive advantage for Confluent, as government agencies often influence trends in cybersecurity and data management practices across other sectors. Financial Analyst Confluent's strategic move to expand its services to Australian Government agencies is likely to have a positive financial impact on the company. The expansion into a market with high entry barriers due to security requirements presents an opportunity for recurring revenue streams and diversification of income sources. The ability to operate across AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud platforms also indicates a versatile and adaptable service offering, which can be attractive to investors looking for companies with robust growth strategies.Short-term implications for stakeholders may include the costs associated with the expansion and the onboarding of new government clients. However, the long-term financial outlook appears favorable, as the government sector typically engages in longer contract periods, providing stable revenue. Additionally, the integration of Confluent's services into government operations may lead to further opportunities within the private sector, as successful government implementations could serve as case studies to attract more clients. 03/12/2024 - 06:00 PM Enabling more Australian Government agencies to use the industry’s leading data streaming platform across cloud providers CANBERRA, Australia--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Confluent, Inc.

The focus of Phase III drilling will be on expanding the mineral resource, improved delineation of high-grade mineralized zones, and reconnaissance drilling on new targets.With extensive historical exploration, over 200,000 metres of drilling and modest past production, significant exploration upside remains. There are several hundred known breccia occurrences mapped at surface, of which less than 40 have been drilled and 17 are included in the MRE.In the Phase II drill program gold assay results confirmed the potential for gold to occur in economic concentrations in certain phases of the mineralization. Gold is not currently included in the MRE. A sampling program is underway to gather sufficient data coverage for potential gold inclusion in future technical studies. The results from the Childs Aldwinkle and Copper Prince breccias have been returned and reported. The Company is continuing the re-assaying of historical material for potential inclusion of gold in future mineral resource updates. Additional areas are expected to include the Pole breccia and the Keel underground zone, with the Company continuing to evaluate other potential areas.The Company has reported results from a metallurgical program focused on grind size optimization that demonstrated the viability of coarse particle flotation, gold recoveries in concentrate and test work on near surface mineralization.The Company is focusing on exploration at the property while continuing to advance technical studies, environmental data gathering and stakeholder outreach.Financial Results Three months ended Year ended In Canadian dollars Dec 31, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 Restated Dec 31, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 Restated Exploration and evaluation expenses $4,383,565 $3,825,785 $15,418,067 $13,255,138 General and administration $418,546 $331,026 $2,345,713 $2,103,465 Share-based compensation $277,676 $611,992 $2,163,404 $4,547,341 Net Loss $5,284,930 $5,211,558 $20,499,964 $21,332,022 Basic and Diluted Loss per Share $0.03 $0.04 $0.12 $0.19 Note: The financial information in this table was selected from the Company's consolidated financial statements for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 (the ""Financial Statements""), which are available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and the Company's website www.faradaycopper.com.

Market Research Analyst The sale of a 28.4% equity interest in Vallourec SA by Apollo-managed Funds to ArcelorMittal represents a significant shift in ownership of a major player in the tubular steel products industry. This transaction, valued at approximately €955 million, not only provides liquidity for the Apollo Funds but also indicates a strategic exit from a successful investment. The sale is reflective of Apollo's confidence in Vallourec's current market position and its potential for future growth, particularly in the energy transition markets.From a market perspective, the deal underscores the attractiveness of Vallourec as an investment, given its record profitability and operational transformation. The transaction may also signal consolidation in the sector, with ArcelorMittal further strengthening its position through this acquisition. Market observers should monitor Vallourec's performance post-transaction to assess the impact of the change in ownership on its strategic direction and market share. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial implications of the sale, the substantial increase in EBITDA from €258 million in 2020 to €1,196 million in 2023 suggests a successful turnaround strategy implemented by Apollo, enhancing Vallourec's value proposition. The transaction price of €14.64 per share will have implications for Vallourec's valuation metrics and could influence investor perception of the stock. This divestiture may also affect the liquidity and volatility of Vallourec's shares on the Euronext exchange.Investors should consider the potential for Vallourec to leverage its improved financial structure to invest in new technologies and market opportunities, especially in the context of the energy transition. The exit of a major equity investor like Apollo could also lead to changes in Vallourec's capital allocation strategies and dividend policies, impacting shareholder returns. Energy Sector Analyst The mention of Vallourec's opportunity to capture future growth in the energy transition markets is particularly noteworthy. Vallourec's focus on high-performance tubular products positions it well to benefit from the global shift towards renewable energy infrastructure, which often requires specialized materials. The acquisition by ArcelorMittal, a company with extensive resources, could provide Vallourec with additional capabilities to innovate and scale operations in this sector.Stakeholders should evaluate how Vallourec's expertise in premium tubular steel products can be leveraged in emerging markets such as carbon capture and storage, hydrogen transport and geothermal energy. The transition of ownership may bring fresh capital and strategic focus to these areas, potentially leading to increased market share and enhanced shareholder value in the long run. 03/12/2024 - 06:21 PM NEW YORK, March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apollo (NYSE: APO) today announced that Apollo-managed Funds (“Apollo Funds” or the “Funds”) have agreed to sell 65.2 million common equity shares in Vallourec SA (Euronext: VK; “Vallourec”, the “Company”), a value-added manufacturer of premium tubular steel products, for €14.64 per share to ArcelorMittal.

Along with this business transformation have come record levels of profitability, a more sustainable competitive position and an opportunity to capture future growth in the energy transition markets,” said Apollo Partner Gareth Turner. “There is still considerable potential to expand upon what we have achieved but it is now appropriate for Apollo to transition our Funds’ shareholding to an industrial partner that can take the Company forward. We remain confident that Vallourec is well-positioned for long-term growth and we wish Philippe and the entire team continued success.” Philippe Guillemot, Vallourec Chairman and CEO, said, “Apollo’s operational and capital markets expertise was instrumental to Vallourec’s turnaround, and we thank the Apollo team for their unfailing support and world-class partnership.

Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly cash dividend by Granite Construction Incorporated represents a tangible return on investment for shareholders. The specified amount of $0.13 per common share is a key figure that can be used to calculate the dividend yield, which is a financial ratio indicating how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price. Investors often view regular dividend payments as a sign of a company's financial health and stability. It is also indicative of the company's confidence in its current cash flow and future earnings.From a financial analysis perspective, examining the company's payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders, would be crucial. This ratio helps in assessing whether the dividend payments are sustainable in the long term. A payout ratio that is too high might indicate that the company is not reinvesting enough back into the business, which could hamper future growth. Conversely, a lower payout ratio might suggest that the company has room to increase its dividend in the future or invest in growth opportunities. Market Research Analyst When a company like Granite Construction declares a dividend, it can have implications for its stock market performance. Dividends can make a stock more attractive to income-focused investors, potentially increasing demand for the shares. The market's reaction to dividend announcements can also be influenced by how the dividend compares to previous payouts and industry standards. If the declared dividend is higher than previous quarters or above the industry average, it might signal to investors a strong financial position and could lead to a positive market response.Furthermore, analyzing the historical stock price movement of Granite Construction around past dividend declarations could provide insights into how the market might react to the current announcement. It is also essential to consider the overall economic context, as macroeconomic factors such as interest rate changes can affect investor preference for dividend-paying stocks. 03/12/2024 - 08:00 PM WATSONVILLE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Granite Construction Incorporated (NYSE: GVA) today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per common share.

Positive Consolidated sales for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 increased to $456.7 million from $438.1 million in the prior year period. Gross profit for the third quarter reached $100.0 million, up from $97.0 million in the prior year period. Net loss from continuing operations improved to $(9.9) million from $(22.1) million in the prior year period.

Total retail segment gross comparable store sales increased by 8.8% to $38.1 million. The company ended the quarter with 1,272 physical and virtual stores, a net decrease of 116 stores compared to the prior year period. The company is maintaining its fiscal year 2024 guidance of approximately $40 million of consolidated non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in gross comparable store sales by 8.8% and the significant growth in First Day® Complete revenue from $67 million to $110 million are positive indicators of Barnes & Noble Education, Inc.'s operational performance. This growth suggests an effective strategy in expanding their BNC First Day programs, which align with the increasing trend towards digital and inclusive access in the education sector. Furthermore, the improvement in the consolidated GAAP net loss from $(22.1) million to $(9.9) million and the increase in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA from $5.2 million to $20.3 million reflect a healthier financial position and operational efficiency gains, primarily driven by a decrease in selling and administrative expenses. However, the reported increase in interest expense by $3.7 million is a concern as it may indicate higher debt levels or less favorable borrowing terms. Additionally, the net decrease of 116 stores points to a strategic shift in the company's operations, likely focusing on profitability and efficiency over physical footprint. Investors should consider these factors in the context of the company's long-term strategy and the broader trends in retail and digital education. Market Research Analyst The retail segment's performance, particularly the 14.1% increase in course material gross comparable store sales, underscores a successful adoption of the company's BNC First Day models, which cater to the evolving needs of students and educational institutions for digital and inclusive access to course materials. This pivot towards digital offerings is in line with industry trends where digital content consumption is rising. However, the 4.6% decrease in general merchandise gross comparable store sales suggests a potential challenge in non-course related segments or a shift in consumer behavior that may need strategic realignment. The operational highlights also reveal a 39% increase in enrollment for the Spring of 2024, which could be indicative of the company's growing market share and effective customer acquisition strategies within the educational materials sector. The impact of these operational strategies on the stock market could be positive if the trend continues and the company successfully manages its liquidity and strengthens its financial position. Economist The company's focus on winding down underperforming stores and the reported net decrease of 116 stores reflect a broader economic trend where businesses are optimizing their physical presence in response to changing consumer preferences and the growth of e-commerce. The increase in consolidated non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA by $15.1 million suggests that the company is improving its operational efficiency, which could lead to better margins and profitability in the long run. However, the significant increase in cash flows used in operating activities from $(21.2) million to $(83.2) million due to changes in working capital, higher accounts receivables and inventory levels could signal liquidity challenges that may impact the company's ability to sustain growth without additional financing or strategic adjustments. The discussions around strengthening liquidity and financial position, including potential refinancing and equity offerings, indicate proactive management but also raise concerns about the current leverage and cash flow positions. These financial maneuvers will be critical for maintaining the company's solvency and could have a significant impact on the stock price, depending on the terms and investor reception of such measures. 03/12/2024 - 08:02 PM Retail Segment Gross Comparable Store Sales Increased 8.8% First Day® Complete Revenue Increased to $110 Million from $67 Million Consolidated GAAP Net Loss from Continuing Operations Improved to $(9.9) Million from $(22.1) Million Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) from Continuing Operations Increased to $20.3 Million from $5.2 Million Executes Bank Amendment and Continues Discussions to Strengthen Liquidity and Financial Position BASKING RIDGE, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Barnes & Noble Education, Inc.

These shifts in timing may affect the comparability of our results across periods.

Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales increased 8.8% for the quarter. Gross comparable course material sales increased 14.1% and gross comparable general merchandise decreased 4.6%. The increase in gross comparable course material product sales was due to growth from the Company’s BNC First Day models, which increased by $63 million to $184 million, compared to $121 million in the prior year period. Third quarter Retail gross profit increased by $0.3 million to $89.2 million, compared to $88.9 million in the prior year period. Retail gross margin as a percentage of sales was 20.3% compared to 21.1% in the prior year period. Retail Product and other gross margin as a percentage of sales was flat primarily from increased sales of $63.3 million from First Day Complete course material sales, and lower contract costs as a percentage of sales related to our college and university contracts as a result of the shift to digital and First Day models and lower performing school contracts not renewed, were partially offset by lower margin rates for course materials due to higher markdowns, including markdowns related to closed stores, and lower general merchandise sales, primarily from closed stores, a lower average commission rate and an unfavorable sales mix due to the shift to digital course materials. Retail Rental gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to 42.1% from 47.6% in the prior year period driven primarily by lower rental margin rates, higher markdowns and unfavorable rental mix, partially offset by lower contract costs as a percentage of sales related to our college and university contracts as a result of the shift to digital and First Day models and lower performing school contracts not renewed. Third quarter Retail selling and administrative expenses decreased by $11.4 million to $71.4 million from $82.8 million in the prior year period. This decrease was primarily due to cost savings initiatives comprised of a $7.9 million decrease in comparable store payroll expense, new/closed store payroll expense and related operating costs, and a $3.4 million decrease in corporate payroll expense, infrastructure and product development costs. Third quarter Retail non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA was $17.9 million, compared to $6.2 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA increased by $11.7 million primarily due to lower selling and administrative expenses. Wholesale Segment Results (Before Intercompany Eliminations) Wholesale third quarter sales decreased by $1.8 million to $37.2 million from $39.0 million in the prior year period. The decrease is primarily due to lower gross sales of $4.5 million, partially offset by lower returns and allowances of $2.7 million compared to the prior year period. Wholesale third quarter gross profit was $8.0 million, or 21.5% of sales, compared to $6.7 million, or 17.1% of sales, in the third quarter of 2023. The gross margin rate increased in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to lower returns and allowances and lower warehouse costs, partially offset by higher markdowns. Third quarter Wholesale selling and administrative expenses decreased by $0.3 million to $3.3 million, compared to $3.6 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to cost savings initiatives comprised of lower payroll expense of $0.4 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $0.1 million. Wholesale non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased by $1.6 million to $4.7 million from $3.1 million in the prior year. The increase in Wholesale non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA is due to the higher gross margin and lower selling and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2024. Cash Flow, Balance Sheet and Refinancing Discussions Cash flows used in operating activities from continuing operations during the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024 were $(83.2) million compared to $(21.2) million during the 39 weeks ended January 28, 2023. This increase in cash flows used in operating activities from continuing operations of $62.0 million was primarily due to changes in working capital, including higher accounts receivables of $81.7 million and higher inventory levels of $88.2 million primarily related to our increased adoption of our BNC First Day equitable and inclusive access sales; higher payments for interest expense of $6.2 million; offset by higher payables of $78.0 million due to delayed payments to vendors for inventory purchases and expenses, as a result of borrowing capacity limitations under our credit facility. Given the growth of our BNC First Day programs, the timing of cash collection from our school partners may shift to periods subsequent to when the revenue is recognized. When a school adopts our BNC First Day equitable and inclusive access offerings, cash collection from the school generally occurs after the institution's drop/add dates, which is later in the working capital cycle, particularly in our third quarter given the timing of the Spring Term and our quarterly reporting period, as compared to direct-to-student point-of-sale transactions where cash is generally collected during the point-of-sale transaction or within a few days from the credit card processor. As a higher percentage of our sales shift to BNC First Day equitable and inclusive access offerings, we are focused on efforts to better align the timing of our cash outflows to course material vendors with cash inflows collected from schools. As of January 27, 2024, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were $8.1 million and total outstanding debt was $254.3 million, as compared to cash and cash equivalents of $9.4 million and total outstanding debt of $283.9 million in the prior year period. The Company is engaged in advanced and ongoing discussions with third parties to evaluate a range of options to strengthen its liquidity and financial position. The potential options under consideration include among other things, a refinancing, in whole or in part, of the Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreements, as well as a potential equity offering, which would likely be conducted at a substantial discount to the current market price of the Company’s common stock. There can be no assurance that any refinancing, equity offering, or other transaction will occur or, if any transaction occurs, that it will ultimately be consummated, or that the Company’s effort to strengthen its liquidity and financial position will be achieved. On March 12, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to its credit agreement to amend certain financial covenants. For more details on the amendment, please refer to the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on March 12, 2024. Fiscal Year 2024 Outlook The Company is maintaining its fiscal year 2024 guidance of approximately $40 million of consolidated non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations. Conference Call The Company will not host an earnings conference call due to the advanced and ongoing discussions with third parties to evaluate a range of options to strengthen its liquidity and financial position.

BARNES & NOBLE EDUCATION, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Segment Information - Discontinued Operations (Unaudited) (In thousands, except percentages) During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, assets related to our Digital Student Solutions (""DSS"") Segment met the criteria for classification as Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations and is no longer a reportable segment. Certain assets and liabilities associated with the DSS Segment are presented in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as ""Assets Held for Sale"" and ""Liabilities Held for Sale"". The results of operations related to the DSS Segment are included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as ""Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax."" The cash flows of the DSS Segment are also presented separately in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. On May 31, 2023, we completed the sale of these assets related to our DSS Segment for cash proceeds of $20,000, net of certain transaction fees, severance costs, escrow, and other considerations. During the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024, we recorded a Gain on Sale of Business of $3,545 in Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net, related to the sale. Net cash proceeds from the sale were used for debt repayment and to provide additional funds for working capital needs under our Credit Facility. The following table summarizes the operating results of the discontinued operations for the periods indicated: Segment Information - Discontinued Operations 13 weeks ended 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 27, 2024 January 28, 2023 Total sales $ — $ 9,010 $ 2,784 $ 26,659 Cost of sales (a) — 1,811 76 5,283 Gross profit (a) — 7,199 2,708 21,376 Selling and administrative expenses 177 7,632 3,101 23,909 Depreciation and amortization — 506 3 2,646 Gain on sale of business (477 ) — (3,545 ) — Impairment loss (non-cash) (b) — — 610 — Restructuring costs (c) 11 1,848 3,308 1,848 Transaction costs — — 13 — Operating income (loss) 289 (2,787 ) (782 ) (7,027 ) Income tax expense — 128 20 297 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax $ 289 $ (2,915 ) $ (802 ) $ (7,324 ) 13 weeks ended 39 weeks ended Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) - Discontinued Operations January 27, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 27, 2024 January 28, 2023 Income (loss) from discontinued operations $ 289 $ (2,915 ) $ (802 ) $ (7,324 ) Add: Depreciation and amortization expense — 506 3 2,646 Income tax expense — 128 20 297 Content amortization (non-cash) — 1,686 — 4,855 Gain on sale of business (477 ) — (3,545 ) — Impairment loss (non-cash) (b) — — 610 — Restructuring costs (c) 11 1,848 3,308 1,848 Transaction costs — — 13 — Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) - Discontinued Operations $ (177 ) $ 1,253 $ (393 ) $ 2,322 (a) Cost of sales and Gross margin for the DSS Segment includes amortization expense (non-cash) related to content development costs of $0 for both the 13 and 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024 and $1,686 and $4,855 for the 13 and 39 weeks ended January 28, 2023, respectively.

Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales includes sales from physical and virtual stores that have been open for an entire fiscal year period and does not include sales from permanently closed stores for all periods presented. For Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales, sales for logo general merchandise fulfilled by Lids, Fanatics and digital agency sales are included on a gross basis in Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales compared to a net basis as commission revenue in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We believe the current Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales calculation method reflects management’s view that such comparable store sales are an important measure of the growth in sales when evaluating how established stores have performed over time. We present this metric as additional useful information about the Company’s operational and financial performance and to allow greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for operating and financial decision-making. Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales are also referred to as ""same-store"" sales by others within the retail industry and the method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable store sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP.

(b) During the 13 weeks ended January 27, 2024, we evaluated certain of our store-level long-lived assets in the Retail segment for impairment. Based on the results of the impairment tests, we recognized an impairment loss (non-cash) of $5,798 (both pre-tax and after-tax) comprised of $364, $2,726, and $2,708 of property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, and amortizable intangibles, respectively. During the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2023, we evaluated certain of our store-level long-lived assets in the Retail segment for impairment. Based on the results of the impairment tests, we recognized an impairment loss (non-cash) of $6,008 (both pre-tax and after-tax) comprised of $708, $1,697, $3,599 and $4 of property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, amortizable intangibles, and other noncurrent assets, respectively. (c) Represents amortization of content development costs (non-cash) recorded in cost of goods sold in the condensed consolidated financial statements. (d) Restructuring and other charges are comprised primarily of severance and other employee termination and benefit costs associated with the elimination of various positions as part of cost reduction objectives, and professional service costs for restructuring, process improvements. (e) There is no pro forma income effect of the non-GAAP items. (f) Interest expense is reflected in Corporate Services as it is primarily related to our Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement which fund our operating and financing needs across the organization. Income taxes are reflected in Corporate Services as we record our income tax provision on a consolidated basis. Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP) (a) - Continuing Operations 13 weeks ended 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 27, 2024 January 28, 2023 Net cash flows used in operating activities from continuing operations (b) $ (36,061 ) $ (31,321 ) $ (83,221 ) $ (21,248 ) Less: Capital expenditures (c) 3,263 4,877 11,459 21,700 Cash interest paid 5,668 6,105 19,640 13,406 Cash taxes (refund) paid (118 ) 1 270 (15,582 ) Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP) $ (44,874 ) $ (42,304 ) $ (114,590 ) $ (40,772 ) (a) For additional information, see ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information"" in the Non-GAAP disclosure information of this Press Release. (b) The increase in Net cash flows used in operating activities from continuing operations is due to higher accounts receivables and higher inventory levels primarily related to our increased adoption of our BNC First Day equitable and inclusive access sales; higher payments for interest expense; and higher payables due to delayed payments to vendors for inventory purchases and expenses, as a result of borrowing capacity limitations under our credit facility. Given the growth of our BNC First Day programs, the timing of cash collection from our school partners may shift to periods subsequent to when the revenue is recognized. When a school adopts our BNC First Day equitable and inclusive access offerings, cash collection from the school generally occurs after the institution's drop/add dates, which is later in the working capital cycle, particularly in our third quarter given the timing of the Spring Term and our quarterly reporting period, as compared to direct-to-student point-of-sale transactions where cash is generally collected during the point-of-sale transaction or within a few days from the credit card processor. As a higher percentage of our sales shift to BNC First Day equitable and inclusive access offerings, we are focused on efforts to better align the timing of our cash outflows to course material vendors with cash inflows collected from schools. (c) Purchases of property and equipment are also referred to as capital expenditures. Our investing activities consist principally of capital expenditures for contractual capital investments associated with renewing existing contracts, new store construction, and enhancements to internal systems and our website. The following table provides the components of total purchases of property and equipment: Capital Expenditures 13 weeks ended 39 weeks ended - Continuing Operations January 27, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 27, 2024 January 28, 2023 Physical store capital expenditures $ 1,158 $ 1,700 $ 5,106 $ 12,248 Product and system development 1,588 2,691 5,048 7,866 Other 517 486 1,305 1,586 Total capital expenditures $ 3,263 $ 4,877 $ 11,459 $ 21,700 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information - Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA by Segment, and Free Cash Flow To supplement the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), in the Press Release attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, the Company uses the financial measures of Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA by Segment and Free Cash Flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures under Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") regulations. We define Adjusted Earnings as net income (loss) from continuing operations adjusted for certain reconciling items that are subtracted from or added to net income (loss) from continuing operations. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) from continuing operations plus (1) depreciation and amortization; (2) interest expense and (3) income taxes, (4) as adjusted for items that are subtracted from or added to net income (loss) from continuing operations. We define Free Cash Flow as Cash Flows from Operating Activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures, cash interest and cash taxes. The non-GAAP measures included in the Press Release have been reconciled to the most comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1, as follows: the reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings to net income (loss) from continuing operations; the reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated net income (loss) from continuing operations; and the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA by Segment to net income (loss) from continuing operations by segment. All of the items included in the reconciliations are either (i) non-cash items or (ii) items that management does not consider in assessing our on-going operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as substitutes for and should not be considered superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the Company's use of these non-GAAP financial measures may be different from similarly named measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We review these non-GAAP financial measures as internal measures to evaluate our performance at a consolidated level and at a segment level and manage our operations. We believe that these measures are useful performance measures which are used by us to facilitate a comparison of our on-going operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than measures under GAAP can provide alone, as they exclude certain items that management believes do not reflect the ordinary performance of our operations in a particular period. Our Board of Directors and management also use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by Segment, at a consolidated level and at a segment level, as one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting expected performance, for evaluating on a quarterly and annual basis actual results against such expectations, and as a measure for performance incentive plans. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA by Segment to determine segment capital allocations. We believe that the inclusion of Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA by Segment results provides investors useful and important information regarding our operating results, in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance.

(""Ridgeback""), was a key contributor to Saturn's growth in 2023, adding 670 net sections of land featuring development opportunities to sustain the Company's production going forward. The acquisition of Ridgeback was highly synergistic to the Company's existing Southeast Saskatchewan assets expanding its high cash flow, light oil production base by approximately 65%; more than doubling the light oil reserve volumes in the area; and added a large undeveloped land position featuring Bakken light oil resource that Saturn can continue to develop. In addition to growing the Company's Saskatchewan footprint, the acquisition also expanded Saturn's operations into Alberta's prolific Cardium, Kaybob and Swan Hills areas.The Company has continued to focus on streamlining its cost structure by reducing overall royalties, decreasing operating costs and improving average hedging pricing:Average royalties decreased to 11.5% in 2023, compared 12.8% in 2022;Average net operating expenses(1) decreased 18% to $20.33 per boe in 2023, compared to $24.67 per boe in 2022; andAverage realized loss on derivatives decreased 80% to $4.41 per boe in 2023, compared to $22.38 in 2022.In light of the above cost reduction impacts, the Company's 2023 operating netback(1), net of derivatives of $43.23 per boe, was comparable to the $43.82 per boe in 2022, despite an approximately 17% drop in the average benchmark WTI oil price to US $77.60 in 2023, compared to an average WTI oil price of US $94.25 in 2022.Saturn drilled as operator in 2023, 47 gross (45.2 net) wells, with the results of the 46 gross operated wells that were placed on production summarized in the table below:Gross Wells Drilled by Formation (number):Avg.

Saturn continues to prioritize the rapid repayment of its Senior Term Loan, and in 2023, the Company made principal payments totaling approximately $164.5 million, with additional aggregate payments of approximately $50.7 million made to date in 2024, for a total of $215.2 million of principal payments since December 31, 2022. The Company intends to continue directing free cash flow to ongoing debt repayment and balance sheet strengthening. Southeast SaskatchewanIn Q4 of 2023, Saturn rig released six gross (4.6 net) Bakken wells, of which two gross wells (2.0 net) were drilled as open hole multi-lateral (""OHML"") wells. These OHML wells feature seven to eight horizontal legs per well and represent the first on which Saturn has deployed this innovative drilling technique. The Company's Bakken light oil development has been a strong addition to its capital program in Southeast Saskatchewan, where Saturn has already successfully drilled a total of 11 gross (9.1 net) Bakken wells in 2023. Saturn has 197 net booked Bakken drilling locations (including 16.9 net OHML locations) and has identified over 100 net unbooked Bakken wells for future development.Saturn successfully drilled three gross (2.3 net) Frobisher wells in Q4 of 2023 for an annual total of 11 gross (10.1 net) Mississippian wells, including two gross (1.9 net) Midale wells, which collectively outperformed IP30 type curve expectations by 17%. The six gross (6.0 net) Spearfish wells drilled in 2023 were a highlight of the year's development program, outperforming IP30 type curve expectations by 16%, while experiencing lower than expected declines. Further budgeted development of Frobisher and Spearfish light oil is expected to be a prominent component of Saturn's 2024 capital investment plan.For the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company's Southeast Saskatchewan assets collectively averaged 12,550 boe/d of production, an increase of 67% from 7,522 boe/d in the comparative 2022 period.West Central SaskatchewanThe Company added a third rig to the fourth quarter development plan in order to extend the drilling success of its Viking light oil targets in West Central Saskatchewan, adding four additional wells with 100% working interest. In 2023 Saturn successfully drilled 19 gross (14.3 net) Viking wells and continued to follow up on its best performing areas of Hershel and Plato with 12 operated wells. These 12 wells were drilled with 100% working interest, had an average IP30 of 97.9 bbls/d of light oil, which outperformed the type curve expectations by 44%. Saturn has 165 net locations booked for future Viking development.The Company's West Central Saskatchewan assets averaged 3,504 boe/d of production for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to 4,992 boe/d in the prior year.Central AlbertaSaturn successfully drilled three Cardium horizontal wells in the fourth quarter of 2023, with 100% working interest, for a total of eight gross (5.3 net) Cardium wells being rig released in 2023. The 2023 Cardium wells drilled by Saturn were Extended Reach Horizontal (""ERH"") wells having an average lateral length of 2.2 miles. Five of the Saturn operated Cardium wells were put on production in Q4 of 2023, with IP30 rates consistent with type cure expectations, and delivering approximately 1,316 boe/d in aggregate during the first 30 days on production. The 6th Cardium well drilled in late 2023 has now been completed along with an additional three gross (3.0 net) ERH Cardium wells drilled to date in 2024. The four new wells are expected to be brought online before the end of Q1 2024. In total during 2024, Saturn expects to drill eight net Cardium ERH wells.For the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company's Central Alberta assets produced an average of 8,066 boe/d.North AlbertaIn December 2023, the Company brought on production a four well pad in Kaybob, with 100% working interest to Saturn. The four wells were within expectations of the Montney type curve for this area and delivered an IP30 rate of approximately 1,254 boe/d in aggregate. Saturn plans to drill an additional four well pad in Kaybob during 2024.For the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company's North Alberta assets produced an average of 2,771 boe/d.ESG InitiativesSaturn continued its dedication to responsible environmental stewardship by directing approximately $10.7 million in 2023 to decommissioning expenditures, including the abandonment of 114 wells that no longer had economic production potential, amounting to approximately 2x the number of gross new wells the Company drilled in 2023.OutlookSaturn's Board of Directors has approved the Company's largest ever development plan in 2024, with a budget of approximately $145.6 million targeting the drilling of up to 61 net wells. With Saturn's extensive pipeline network and facilities infrastructure within each of its core operating areas, the Company has ample capacity to handle incremental new production coming on-stream. Over 85% of the Company's 2024 development capital expenditures will be directed to drilling, completions, equipping and tie-in of new production.Through the first quarter of 2024, the Company employed a full-time rig in Southeast Saskatchewan, resulting in the drilling of five gross (5.0 net) conventional wells (two Frobisher, two Spearfish, one Tilston) all of which have been put onto production. The Company is now drilling the first of two Bakken OHML wells that will continue through the first half of 2024 with 100% working interest to Saturn.Additional details on Saturn's 2024 Capital Investment Program is available within the Company's Guidance Presentation now available on the website at https://saturnoil.com/investors/#presentations-and-events.Investor WebcastSaturn will host a webcast at 10:00 AM MDT (12:00 PM Noon EDT) on Wednesday, March 13, 2024, to review the year end and fourth quarter 2023 financial results and provide additional colour on the Company's operational highlights.

These non-GAAP and other financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other issuers. Non-GAAP and other financial measures should not be considered to be more meaningful than GAAP measures which are determined in accordance with IFRS. The disclosure under the section ""Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures"" including non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, capital management measures and supplementary financial measures in the Company's Condensed consolidated interim financial statements and MD&A are incorporated by reference into this news release.This press release uses the terms ""adjusted EBITDA"", ""adjusted funds flow"", ""free funds flow"" and ""net debt"" which are capital management measures. See the disclosure under ""Capital Management"" in our audited consolidated financial statements for the three months and the year ended December 31, 2023, for an explanation and composition of these measures and how these measures provide useful information to an investor, and the additional purposes, if any, for which management uses these measures.Free funds flowThe Company considers free funds flow to be a key capital management measure as it is used to determine the efficiency and liquidity of Saturn's business, measuring its funds available after capital investment available for debt repayment, pursue acquisitions and gauge optionality to pay dividends and/or return capital to shareholders through share repurchases. Saturn calculates Free funds flow as Adjusted funds flow in the period less expenditures on property, plant and equipment and exploration and evaluation assets, together ""capital expenditures"". By removing the impact of current period capital expenditures from adjusted funds flow, management monitors its free funds flow to inform its capital allocation decisions.Three months ended December 31, Year ended December 31, ($000s)2023202220232022 Adjusted funds flow80,24750,729278,138118,658Capital expenditures(57,175)(35,676)(130,573)(89,105)Free funds flow23,07215,053147,56529,553 Capital ExpendituresSaturn uses capital expenditures to monitor its capital investments relative to those budgeted by the Company on an annual basis. Saturn's capital budget excludes acquisition and disposition activities as well as the accounting impact of any accrual changes or payments under certain lease arrangements. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for capital expenditures is cash flow used in investing activities. The following table reconciles capital expenditures and capital expenditures, net acquisitions and dispositions (""A&D"") to the nearest GAAP measure, cash flow used in investing activities. Three months ended December 31, Year ended December 31,($000s)2023202220232022 Cash flow used in investing activities38,72541,747576,405318,238Change in non-cash working capital18,450(5,266)20,83019,234 Capital expenditures, net A&D57,17536,481597,235337,472Acquisitions, net of cash acquired-(805)(466,662)(248,367)Capital expenditures57,17535,676130,57389,105 Net operating expensesNet operating expense is calculated by deducting processing income primarily generated by processing third party production at processing facilities where the Company has an ownership interest, from operating expenses presented on the Statement of income (loss). Where the Company has excess capacity at one of its facilities, it will process third-party volumes to reduce the cost of ownership in the facility. The Company's primary business activities are not that of a midstream entity whose activities are focused on earning processing and other infrastructure-based revenues, and as such third-party processing revenue is netted against operating expenses in the MD&A. This metric is used by management to evaluate the Company's net operating expenses on a unit of production basis. Net operating expense per boe is a non-GAAP financial ratio and is calculated as net operating expense divided by total barrels of oil equivalent produced over a specific period of time. The calculation of the Company's net operating expenses is shown within the net operating expenses section of our MD&A for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023.Operating netback and Operating netback, net of derivativesThe Company's operating netback is determined by deducting royalties, net operating expenses and transportation expenses from petroleum and natural gas sales. The Company's operating netback, net of derivatives is calculated by adding or deducting realized financial derivative commodity contract gains or losses from the operating netback. The Company's operating netback and operating netback, net of derivatives are used in operational and capital allocation decisions. Presenting operating netback and operating netback, net of derivatives on a per boe basis is a non-GAAP financial ratio and allows management to better analyze performance against prior periods on a per unit of production basis. The calculation of the Company's operating netbacks and operating netback, net of derivatives are summarized as follows. Three months ended December 31,Year ended December 31, ($000s)2023202220232022 Petroleum and natural gas sales185,384111,558693,891367,957Royalties(24,124)(11,022)(80,565)(47,640)Net operating expenses(44,945)(25,817)(180,074)(86,379)Transportation expenses(3,094)(518)(11,314)(2,139)Operating netback113,22174,201421,938231,799Realized loss on financial derivatives(8,893)(9,540)(39,048)(78,349)Operating netback, net of derivatives104,32864,661382,890153,450 ($ per boe amounts) Petroleum and natural gas sales74.9396.9078.35105.09Royalties(9.75)(9.57)(9.10)(13.61)Net operating expenses(18.17)(22.42)(20.33)(24.67)Transportation expenses(1.25)(0.45)(1.28)(0.61)Operating netback45.7664.4647.6466.20Realized loss on financial derivatives(3.59)(8.29)(4.41)(22.38)Operating netback, net of derivatives42.1756.1743.2343.82 Adjusted EBITDAThe Company considers adjusted EBITDA to be a key capital management measure as it is both used within certain financial covenants prescribed under the Company's Senior Term Loan (note 11) and demonstrates Saturn's standalone profitability, operating and financial performance in terms of cash flow generation, adjusting for interest related to its capital structure. Adjusted EBITDA is defined by the Company as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other noncash or extraordinary items.Adjusted funds flowThe Company considers adjusted funds flow to be a key capital management measure as it demonstrates Saturn's ability to generate the necessary funds to manage production levels and fund future growth through capital investment. Management believes that this measure provides an insightful assessment of Saturn's operations on a continuing basis by eliminating certain non-cash charges, actual settlements of decommissioning obligations, of which the nature and timing of expenditures may vary based on the stage of the Company's assets and operating areas, and transaction costs which vary based on the Company's acquisition and disposition activity.Free funds flowThe Company considers free funds flow to be a key capital management measure as it is used to determine the efficiency and liquidity of Saturn's business, measuring its funds available after capital investment available for debt repayment, pursue acquisitions and gauge optionality to pay dividends and/or return capital to shareholders through share repurchases. Saturn calculates free funds flow as adjusted funds flow in the period less expenditures on property, plant and equipment and exploration and evaluation assets, together ""capital expenditures"".

Any reference in this news release to initial production rates consist of the above noted product types, using a conversion rate of 1 bbl : 6 MCF (where applicable). Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such rates in calculating aggregate production for Saturn. Per boe or ($/boe) Any reference in this news release to disclosures for petroleum and natural gas sales, royalties, operating expenses, transportation expenses and marketing expenses on a per boe basis are supplementary financial measures that are calculated by dividing each of these respective GAAP measures by Saturn's total production volumes for the period.Per Share AmountsPer share amounts noted in this news release are based on Saturn's weighted average issued and outstanding common shares as of December 31, 2023, unless noted otherwise.Boe PresentationBoe means barrel of oil equivalent. All boe conversions in this news release are derived by converting gas to oil at the ratio of six thousand cubic feet (""Mcf"") of natural gas to one barrel (""Bbl"") of oil. Boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A Boe conversion rate of 1 Bbl : 6 Mcf is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio of oil compared to natural gas based on currently prevailing prices is significantly different than the energy equivalency ratio of 1 Bbl: 6 Mcf, utilizing a conversion ratio of 1 Bbl : 6 Mcf may be misleading as an indication of value.Forward-Looking Information and Statements.Certain information included in this press release constitutes forward-looking information under applicable securities legislation.

Economist The financial results of Qifu Technology reflect broader economic trends, such as the impact of macroeconomic challenges on consumer credit behavior.

Meanwhile, we continued to solidify our relationship with financial institution partners. With the help of record-breaking ABS issuance, we significantly lowered overall funding costs to historic low. We will continue to take a prudent approach in our business planning in 2024. In particular, we intend to focus on driving profitability and efficiency of our operations as we continue to tighten our risk management standard and optimize our business mix to achieve quality growth.

Our strong financial positions not only allow us to consistently execute our strategy but also enable us to further enhance returns to our shareholders by launching a new significantly enlarged share repurchase plan for 2024, further demonstrating management’s confidence and commitment to our business.” Mr. Yan Zheng, Chief Risk Officer, added, “The fourth quarter was a challenging period for risk management as economic difficulties impacted some borrowers’ capability to repay loans and an industry-wide technical issue reduced the effectiveness of our collection operations. Among key leading indicators, Day-1 delinquency rate*13 was 5.0% in the fourth quarter, and 30-day collection rate*14 was 84.9%. We took further actions to mitigate the risks by reducing exposures to higher risk and longer duration loans and by driving more non-credit risk bearing services. Such actions started to show positive impact to risk metrics so far in 2024 and we expect to see further gradual improvement throughout this year.” 13 “Day-1 delinquency rate” is defined as (i) the total amount of principal that became overdue as of a specified date, divided by (ii) the total amount of principal that was due for repayment as of such specified date.14 “30 day collection rate” is defined as (i) the amount of principal that was repaid in one month among the total amount of principal that became overdue as of a specified date, divided by (ii) the total amount of principal that became overdue as of such specified date.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Statement To supplement our financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use Non-GAAP financial measure, which is adjusted from results based on U.S. GAAP to exclude share-based compensation expenses. Reconciliations of our Non-GAAP financial measures to our U.S. GAAP financial measures are set forth in tables at the end of this earnings release, which provide more details on the Non-GAAP financial measures. We use Non-GAAP income from operation, Non-GAAP operating margin, Non-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net income margin, Non-GAAP net income attributed to the Company and Non-GAAP net income per fully diluted ADS in evaluating our operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. Non-GAAP income from operation represents income from operation excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP operating margin is equal to Non-GAAP income from operation divided by total net revenue. Non-GAAP net income represents net income excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income margin is equal to Non-GAAP net income divided by total net revenue. Non-GAAP net income attributed to the Company represents net income attributed to the Company excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net income per fully diluted ADS represents net income excluding share-based compensation expenses per fully diluted ADS. Such adjustments have no impact on income tax. We believe that Non-GAAP income from operation and Non-GAAP net income help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain expenses that we include in results based on U.S. GAAP. We believe that Non-GAAP income from operation and Non-GAAP net income provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. Our Non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to U.S. GAAP results. In addition, our calculation of Non-GAAP financial information may be different from the calculation used by other companies, and therefore comparability may be limited.

Ventas Declares First Quarter 2024 Dividend of $0.45 Per Common Share,2024-03-12T22:24:00.000Z,Low,Very Positive,"Ventas, Inc. (VTR) declares a quarterly dividend of $0.45 per common share, payable on April 18, 2024, to stockholders of record as of April 1, 2024.","Ventas Declares First Quarter 2024 Dividend of $0.45 Per Common Share Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags dividends earnings Rhea-AI Summary Ventas, Inc. (VTR) declares a quarterly dividend of $0.45 per common share, payable on April 18, 2024, to stockholders of record as of April 1, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly dividend by Ventas, Inc. signifies a distribution of earnings to shareholders and is a critical indicator of the company's financial health and stability. At $0.45 per common share, this dividend payout needs to be evaluated against the company's earnings per share (EPS) to assess sustainability. If the payout ratio (dividend divided by EPS) is too high, it could suggest that the company is not reinvesting enough back into growth or may not be able to maintain the dividend in the event of a downturn.Moreover, dividends are often a sign of a company's confidence in its current and future cash flows. Investors typically view regular and consistent dividends as a positive signal, potentially leading to increased demand for Ventas' stock. However, it's essential to consider the yield, which is the dividend rate divided by the stock price, to understand the return on investment for shareholders. The market will also compare this yield to industry standards and fixed income alternatives. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Ventas' dividend declaration could impact investor sentiment and stock performance. Dividends are often factored into the valuation models, such as the Dividend Discount Model (DDM), which could alter the perceived value of Ventas' shares. Additionally, the timing of the dividend, set to be paid on April 18, 2024, may lead to short-term trading strategies around the ex-dividend date, as investors position themselves to capture the dividend payout.It's also pertinent to assess the company's sector and market conditions. As a real estate investment trust (REIT), Ventas' ability to sustain dividends is closely tied to the performance of the real estate market, occupancy rates and rental income. Changes in interest rates can also significantly impact REITs, as they affect borrowing costs and property values. Economist Examining the broader economic implications, dividend declarations can reflect corporate sector health and contribute to the overall economic picture. In a stable or growing economy, companies like Ventas may have the confidence to return capital to shareholders. Conversely, in an economic downturn, dividend cuts or suspensions are common and can signal broader financial stress within an industry or the economy as a whole.Investors also view dividends as a hedge against inflation, especially in sectors like real estate, where rents and property values may rise with inflation. Thus, the dividend announcement by Ventas could be interpreted as a positive economic indicator, provided the company maintains a prudent payout ratio that allows for growth and capital preservation. 03/12/2024 - 06:24 PM CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) (“Ventas” or the “Company”) today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.45 per common share.

Adjusted loss Adjusted loss and adjusted loss per share are non-IFRS measures that the Company considers to better reflect normalized earnings because it eliminates non-recurring items. Certain items that become applicable in a period may be adjusted for, with the Company retroactively presenting comparable periods with an adjustment for such items and conversely, items no longer applicable may be removed from the calculation. Neither adjusted loss nor adjusted loss per share have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.

(SHOT) filed a federal lawsuit against Capybara Research and others in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The defendants exhibited evasive behavior, leading to default judgments. Safety Shot seeks a default judgment against the defendants on March 15, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the ongoing lawsuit between Safety Shot, Inc. and the Capybara Defendants, including Accretive Capital d/b/a Benzinga, represents a significant event that could have material implications for Safety Shot's business operations and financial health. The issuance of a Certificate of Default indicates that the defendants have not responded to the lawsuit within the given timeframe, which may suggest either a strategic decision or an inability to mount a defense. If Safety Shot is granted a default judgment, it could potentially receive damages or injunctive relief that may impact its financial statements and operational strategies.The legal process of serving defendants via alternative means, such as email, X accounts and public disclosures, is a relatively recent development in the legal field, reflecting the modern challenges of serving entities that operate primarily online or have no fixed physical address. This case could set a precedent for similar future cases, affecting how companies approach litigation strategy and risk management. Financial Analyst From a financial analysis perspective, the lawsuit's progression to a potential default judgment stage could be a double-edged sword for Safety Shot, Inc. On one hand, a favorable judgment may provide financial compensation that could bolster the company's earnings and improve investor sentiment. On the other hand, the costs associated with ongoing litigation are often substantial and can drain resources, reflecting negatively on the company's financial performance in the short term.Investors and analysts will be closely monitoring the outcome of the March 15 hearing for any indications of potential financial impact. The ability of Safety Shot to successfully navigate the legal system and enforce any judgment awarded will be critical in assessing the company's management effectiveness and operational resilience. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the legal action undertaken by Safety Shot, Inc. against Capybara Research and Benzinga is likely to influence investor perceptions and the company's reputation in the market. The outcome of the lawsuit, especially if it results in a default judgment in favor of Safety Shot, could send a strong message to the market about the company's aggressive stance on protecting its interests.However, it is also important to consider the potential reputational risks associated with such legal disputes. Prolonged legal battles can cast a shadow over a company's public image, potentially affecting consumer and investor confidence. Market analysts will evaluate the broader implications of this lawsuit on the company's brand equity and future market positioning. 03/12/2024 - 04:15 PM JUPITER, FL, March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On December 5, 2023, Safety Shot, Inc.

Upon the filing of the February Form 8-K/A, the Capybara Defendants were provided the Constitutional requirement of actual notice of the Capybara Action pursuant to Rule 4(f)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

(ARI) declares a dividend of $0.35 per share of common stock, payable on April 15, 2024, to stockholders of record on March 28, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a dividend of $0.35 per share by Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. signifies a distribution of profits to shareholders, reflecting the company's current financial health and liquidity position. Investors often view such declarations as a positive signal, as they represent a tangible return on investment. However, the sustainability of dividends is contingent upon the company's future earnings and cash flow. It is critical to analyze the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the stock price, to assess the attractiveness of the stock relative to others in the market.Additionally, the payout ratio, the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends, should be evaluated to determine if the dividends are being financed from earnings or through debt, which could be a red flag. A comparison with industry averages and historical dividend patterns of the company can provide insights into Apollo's strategic approach to shareholder returns and whether this level of dividend is consistent with their long-term financial strategy. Market Research Analyst Dividend announcements can have a direct impact on stock market performance, particularly for income-focused investors. Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc.'s dividend declaration may influence investor sentiment and could potentially attract a new cohort of dividend-seeking shareholders. The timing of the announcement, ahead of the record date, is standard practice, allowing investors to make timely decisions regarding their investment portfolios.It is also essential to monitor market trends and the performance of real estate investment trusts (REITs) as a sector, as they have unique tax implications and distribution requirements. REITs are generally expected to pay out a majority of their taxable income as dividends and a deviation from this norm could indicate a strategic shift or a response to changing market conditions. The impact on Apollo's stock price and investor demand following the dividend announcement could provide an indication of market perception and confidence in the company's financial stability and growth prospects. 03/12/2024 - 04:15 PM NEW YORK, March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc.

The company plans to launch a public debt exchange offer to further reduce debt by $600 million, lowering annual interest expenses by $13 million. This strategic move aims to strengthen Rackspace's financial position and enhance its ability to provide industry-leading hybrid, multicloud, and AI solutions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of a private debt exchange and the subsequent launch of a public exchange offer by Rackspace Technology are strategic financial maneuvers aimed at optimizing the company's capital structure. The reduction of $375 million in net debt and the procurement of $275 million in new financing will not only improve the balance sheet by increasing liquidity but will also reduce the company's leverage, making it more resilient to financial stressors. These actions are likely to be well-received by investors as they indicate a proactive approach to debt management and a commitment to financial stability.Furthermore, the extension of debt maturities to May 2028 provides the company with a longer runway to execute its strategic initiatives without the immediate pressure of refinancing. The potential to reduce net debt by an additional $600 million and lower annual interest expenses by approximately $40 million, assuming full participation in the Public Exchange Offer, could significantly decrease the cost of capital and enhance the company's investment in growth areas such as hybrid, multicloud and AI solutions. These moves are indicative of a company strategically positioning itself for sustainable growth and improved financial performance. Market Research Analyst Rackspace Technology's announcement reflects a broader trend in the tech industry where companies are increasingly seeking to strengthen their financial positions to better compete in dynamic markets. By reducing debt and extending maturities, Rackspace aims to enhance its competitiveness in the hybrid, multicloud and AI solutions space—a sector that is experiencing rapid growth and transformation. The additional liquidity can be pivotal for Rackspace to invest in research and development, expand its service offerings and potentially increase market share.The technology sector is highly sensitive to changes in financial health and investor sentiment. Rackspace's strategic financial restructuring may lead to improved credit ratings and investor confidence, which in turn could positively impact its stock price. This initiative could also set a precedent for other companies within the industry, highlighting the importance of active capital management in driving long-term business growth and investor returns. Debt Restructuring Advisor Through the lens of debt restructuring, Rackspace's approach is significant. The private exchange has allowed the company to negotiate directly with a majority of its creditors to improve its debt profile. This kind of transaction is often complex and requires careful navigation of legal and financial implications. The successful reduction of net debt and extension of maturities, coupled with the reception of new money, indicates a strong relationship between Rackspace and its creditors, which is an essential factor in any restructuring scenario.The introduction of tighter covenants and other restrictions in the new terms suggests a mutual understanding of risk management between the company and its lenders. These revised terms are likely designed to protect the lenders' interests while providing the company with the flexibility needed to pursue its strategic objectives. The overall debt restructuring strategy adopted by Rackspace is a textbook example of how companies can effectively manage their liabilities to create a more favorable financial environment for growth and operational excellence. 03/12/2024 - 04:15 PM Company to Receive $275 Million of New Money to Advance Key Strategic Initiatives Company to Launch Public Exchange Offer to All Existing Term Loan Lenders and Secured Note Holders SAN ANTONIO, March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rackspace Technology® (NASDAQ: RXT), (“Rackspace” or the “Company”), a leading end-to-end hybrid, multicloud, and AI solutions company, today announced that it has closed a private debt exchange (the “Private Exchange”) with certain of its creditors representing more than 72% of the Company’s first lien term loans and more than 64% of its first lien notes, as well as 100% of its Revolving Credit Facility (“RCF”) commitments. Through the Private Exchange, Rackspace has eliminated more than $375 million of net debt and has received $275 million of new money (the “New Money Financing”) that will come to the balance sheet as additional liquidity to advance key strategic initiatives. Additionally, the maturities on the RCF and other participating senior debt facilities were extended to May 2028. In connection with the transaction, the Company plans to launch a public debt exchange offer (the “Public Exchange Offer”) to all its outstanding lenders and first lien noteholders. The Public Exchange Offer will offer existing lenders and first lien noteholders new term loans or new first lien notes, as applicable, with an improved security position, tighter covenants, and other restrictions. Through full participation in the Public Exchange Offer, the Company has the opportunity to eliminate more than $600 million in net debt, reducing net annual interest expense by approximately $13 million. These transactions represent another significant step forward in the Company’s capital structure evolution. Following the closing of the Public Exchange Offer and assuming full participation, Rackspace will have raised $575 million of new capital over the past 12 months, reducing the Company’s net financial debt by over $900 million during such period and lowering its net annual interest expense by approximately $40 million. In addition, with the extension and amendment of the RCF, Rackspace will continue to have access to the full $375 million available under the RCF, bringing total liquidity to over $700 million. “By both significantly reducing our debt and infusing new capital, this transaction strengthens Rackspace Technology’s financial position and enhances our ability to continue delivering value to our customers with industry-leading hybrid, multicloud and AI solutions,” said Amar Maletira, Chief Executive Officer of Rackspace Technology. “The confidence of our financial partners is an encouraging testament to the momentum we have achieved over the last year, and we look forward to accelerating execution of our strategic growth initiatives.” There will be no change in Rackspace’s equity ownership as a result of the transaction, which significantly decreases the Company’s debt balance and reduces its interest expense. Advisors Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP served as legal counsel for the Company, PJT Partners LP served as investment banker for the Company, and C Street Advisory Group served as strategic communications advisor in the transaction. Latham & Watkins LLP served as legal counsel to the special committee of the Company’s board of directors.

The combined development programs have a steady cadence of anticipated catalysts with programs ranging from pre-clinical to registration studies. Ivospemin (SBP-101)Ivospemin is a proprietary polyamine analogue designed to induce polyamine metabolic inhibition (PMI) by exploiting an observed high affinity of the compound for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and other tumors. It has shown signals of tumor growth inhibition in clinical studies of metastatic pancreatic cancer patients, demonstrating a median overall survival (OS) of 14.6 months and an objective response rate (ORR) of 48%, both exceeding what is typical for the standard of care of gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel suggesting potential complementary activity with the existing FDA-approved standard chemotherapy regimen. In data evaluated from clinical studies to date, ivospemin has not shown exacerbation of bone marrow suppression and peripheral neuropathy, which can be chemotherapy-related adverse events. Serious visual adverse events have been evaluated and patients with a history of retinopathy or at risk of retinal detachment will be excluded from future SBP-101 studies. The safety data and PMI profile observed in the previous Panbela-sponsored clinical trials provide support for continued evaluation of ivospemin in the ASPIRE trial. Flynpovi ™Flynpovi is a combination of CPP-1X (eflornithine) and sulindac with a dual mechanism inhibiting polyamine synthesis and increasing polyamine export and catabolism. In a Phase III clinical trial in patients with sporadic large bowel polyps, the combination prevented > 90% subsequent pre-cancerous sporadic adenomas versus placebo. Focusing on FAP patients with lower gastrointestinal tract anatomy in the recent Phase III trial comparing Flynpovi to single agent eflornithine and single agent sulindac, FAP patients with lower GI anatomy (patients with an intact colon, retained rectum or surgical pouch), showed statistically significant benefit compared to both single agents (p≤0.02) in delaying surgical events in the lower GI for up to four years. The safety profile for Flynpovi did not significantly differ from the single agents and supports the continued evaluation of Flynpovi for FAP. CPP-1XCPP-1X (eflornithine) is being developed as a single agent tablet or high dose powder sachet for several indications including prevention of gastric cancer, treatment of neuroblastoma and recent onset Type 1 diabetes. Preclinical studies as well as Phase I or Phase II investigator-initiated trials suggest that CPP-1X treatment may be well-tolerated and has potential activity.

The company's financial outlook for Q1 2024 shows a cautious approach with expected non-GAAP loss per share and other income (expense) figures. Financial Analyst The reported decrease in fourth quarter revenue by 9% and a 5% year-over-year decline for 2023 indicates a contraction in Rackspace Technology's business performance. Such a decline is particularly noteworthy in the context of the broader cloud services market, which has been experiencing growth. The decline in Private Cloud revenue by 14% year-over-year is significant, as it suggests a possible shift in customer preferences or increased competition. However, the slight increase in Public Cloud revenue by 0.4% year-over-year could imply resilience in this segment.The company's efforts in debt refinancing and reduction of net financial debt by over $900 million are positive steps towards improving the balance sheet. The reduction in net annual interest expenses by approximately $40 million could enhance future profitability. However, investors should be cautious about the non-cash impairment charges of $761 million for 2023, as they reflect adjustments to the company's asset values and could indicate overvaluation in previous periods or a reevaluation of future earning potential.For the short term, stakeholders should monitor the company's Q1 2024 guidance and the execution of strategic initiatives funded by the new capital. In the long term, the success of the company's turnaround strategy and its ability to adapt to technology inflection points will be crucial for sustained growth and market share recovery. Market Research Analyst The cloud computing industry is highly dynamic, with rapid technological advancements and evolving customer needs. Rackspace's reported year-over-year revenue decline contrasts with the industry's growth trend, which may raise concerns about the company's competitive positioning and market strategy. The differentiation between Private Cloud and Public Cloud offerings is crucial as they cater to different market segments and customer needs. The decline in Private Cloud revenue could indicate a need for Rackspace to reassess its service offerings or market approach in this area.Debt refinancing in a high-rate environment shows proactive financial management, but the company's ability to generate positive cash flow and return to profitability will be critical for investor confidence. The capital expenditures increase in 2023 compared to 2022 suggests ongoing investments in the business, which could lead to future growth if managed effectively.Investors should also consider industry benchmarks and peer performance when evaluating Rackspace's financial health and strategic direction. The company's focus on emerging technology inflection points could be a potential avenue for regaining growth momentum, provided it aligns with market demands and customer adoption rates. Debt Market Analyst The debt refinancing and reduction activities undertaken by Rackspace are indicative of a strategic approach to managing its capital structure in a challenging interest rate environment. By reducing net financial debt and securing new capital, the company is attempting to improve its financial flexibility and extend debt maturities. The success of the private debt exchange and the anticipated public debt exchange offer could be pivotal in strengthening the company's balance sheet.However, the extension of debt maturities to May 2028 and the reduction in net annual interest expense must be weighed against the company's ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations. The cash flow from operating activities reported for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 will be a key metric to watch, as it reflects the company's operational efficiency and liquidity position.Stakeholders should closely monitor the outcome of the public exchange offer and the impact of tighter covenants and restrictions on the company's operational flexibility. The long-term viability of Rackspace's financial strategy will depend on the company's performance in its core business operations and its ability to navigate the competitive landscape of cloud services. 03/12/2024 - 04:15 PM Fourth Quarter Revenue of $720 million, down 9% Year-over-Year; 2023 Revenue of $2,957 million, down 5% Year-over-YearFourth Quarter Private Cloud Revenue of $285 million, down 14% Year-over-Year; 2023 Private Cloud Revenue of $1,210 million, down 12% Year-over-YearFourth Quarter Public Cloud Revenue of $435 million, down 5% Year-over-Year; 2023 Public Cloud Revenue of $1,747 million up 0.4% Year-over-YearFourth Quarter Cash Flow From Operating Activities of $72 million; 2023 Cash Flow From Operating Activities of $375 millionSince start of 2023, Estimated Net Financial Debt Reduction of over $900 million through Debt Repurchases and Refinancings, Lowering Net Annual Interest Expense by approximately $40 Million, Assuming Full Participation in Public Exchange Offer SAN ANTONIO, March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rackspace Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: RXT), a leading end-to-end hybrid, multicloud, and AI solutions company, today announced results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. Amar Maletira, Chief Executive Officer, stated, “I'm pleased to announce that our results for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 exceeded the midpoint of our revenue, operating profit, and EPS guidance. FY23 was a period of transition, through which we focused on implementing structural changes to facilitate a turnaround, repositioning Rackspace to capitalize on emerging technology inflections points and strengthening our capital structure and I am happy with the progress we have made this year.” Mr. Maletira added, “I’m excited to announce our successful debt refinancing amidst the highest rate environment seen in 20 years. Assuming full participation in the public exchange offer, we will have managed to reduce our net financial debt by over $900 million while securing an additional $575 million of new capital over the past 12 months, resulting in lower interest expenses and extended maturities, thereby enhancing our financial flexibility and improving liquidity.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Results Revenue was $720 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of 9% on a reported and constant currency basis as compared to revenue of $787 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Private Cloud revenue was $285 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of 14% on a reported basis and 15% on a constant currency basis as compared to revenue of $330 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Public Cloud revenue was $435 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of 5% on a reported and constant currency basis as compared to revenue of $457 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The fourth quarter of 2023 included a total of $4 million of non-cash impairment charges compared to $217 million of non-cash impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2022. The impairments in the fourth quarter of 2022 were driven primarily by a decline in our market capitalization following the ransomware attack on our Hosted Exchange email business and impairment of our headquarters office. Loss from operations was $(15) million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to loss from operations of $(227) million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net income was $28 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to net loss of $(214) million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net income per diluted share was $0.13 in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to net loss per diluted share of $(1.01) in the fourth quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP Operating Profit was $48 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of 34% compared to $74 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP Loss Per Share was $(0.03) in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of 150% as compared to Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share of $0.06 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Capital expenditures were $38 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full Year 2023 Results Revenue was $2,957 million in 2023, a decrease of 5% on a reported and constancy currency basis as compared to revenue of $3,122 million in 2022. Private Cloud revenue was $1,210 million in 2023, a decrease of 12% on a reported basis and 13% on a constant currency basis as compared to revenue of $1,382 million in 2022. Public Cloud revenue was $1,747 million in 2023, an increase of 0.4% on a reported and constancy currency basis as compared to revenue of $1,741 million in 2022. 2023 included a total of $761 million of non-cash impairment charges compared to $681 million of non-cash impairment charges in 2022. These impairments were primarily a result of a sustained decrease in our market capitalization. Loss from operations was $(899) million in 2023, compared to loss from operations of $(679) million in 2022. Net loss was $(838) million in 2023, compared to net loss of $(805) million in 2022. Net loss per diluted share was $(3.89) in 2023, compared to net loss per diluted share of $(3.81) in 2022. Non-GAAP Operating Profit was $183 million in 2023, a decrease of 50% compared to $364 million in 2022. Non-GAAP Loss Per Share was $(0.15) in 2023, a decrease of 128% as compared to Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share of $0.54 in 2022. Capital expenditures were $181 million in 2023, compared to $142 million in 2022. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $197 million with no balance outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility ($375 million of undrawn commitments). Debt Refinancing On March 12, the Company closed a private debt exchange (the “Private Exchange”) with certain of its creditors representing more than 72% of the Company’s first lien term loans and more than 64% of its first lien notes, as well as 100% of its Revolving Credit Facility lenders. Through the Private Exchange, Rackspace has eliminated more than $375 million of net debt and has received $275 million of new money (the “New Money Financing”) to advance key strategic initiatives. Additionally, the maturities on the participating debt facilities were extended to May 2028. In connection with the transaction, the Company plans to launch a public debt exchange offer (the “Public Exchange Offer”) to all of its outstanding lenders and first lien noteholders. The Public Exchange Offer will offer existing lenders and first lien noteholders new term loans or new first lien notes, as applicable, with an improved security position, tighter covenants, and other restrictions. Through full participation in the Public Exchange Offer, the Company has the opportunity to eliminate more than $600 million in net debt, reducing net annual interest expense by approximately $13 million. Financial Outlook Rackspace Technology is providing guidance as follows: Q1 2024 GuidanceRevenue$680 - $690 millionPrivate Cloud Revenue$268 - $273 millionPublic Cloud Revenue$412 - $417 millionNon-GAAP Operating Profit$12 - $14 millionNon-GAAP Loss Per Share($0.12) - ($0.14)Non-GAAP Other Income (Expense)($50) – ($52) millionNon-GAAP Tax Expense Rate26%Non-GAAP Weighted Average Shares221 – 223 million Definitions of non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the most directly comparable measures in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) are provided in subsequent sections of this press release narrative and supplemental schedules. Rackspace Technology has not reconciled Non-GAAP Operating Profit, Non-GAAP Loss Per Share, Non-GAAP Other Income (Expense) or Non-GAAP Tax Expense Rate guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because it does not provide guidance on GAAP net income (loss) or the reconciling items between these Non-GAAP measures and GAAP net income (loss) as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, certain of these items, such as share-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort. With respect to Non-GAAP Operating Profit, Non-GAAP Loss Per Share, Non-GAAP Other Income (Expense) and Non-GAAP Tax Expense Rate guidance, adjustments in future periods are generally expected to be similar to the kinds of charges and costs excluded from these Non-GAAP measures in prior periods, but the impact of such adjustments could be significant. Conference Call and Webcast Rackspace Technology will hold a conference call today, March 12, 2024, at 4:00pm CT / 5:00pm ET to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2023 results.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Constant Currency Revenue We use constant currency revenue as an additional metric for understanding and assessing our growth excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on our international business operations. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period and is calculated by translating the non-U.S. dollar income statement balances for the most current period to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rate from the comparative period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective period. We also believe this is an important metric to help investors evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods.

Non-GAAP Gross Profit We present Non-GAAP Gross Profit because we believe the measure is useful in analyzing trends in our underlying, recurring gross margins. We define Non-GAAP Gross Profit as gross profit, adjusted to exclude the impact of share-based compensation expense and other non-recurring or unusual compensation items, purchase accounting-related effects, certain business transformation-related costs, and costs related to the Hosted Exchange incident.

This amount also includes certain costs associated with the July 2021 Restructuring Plan which are not accounted for as exit and disposal costs under ASC 420, including one-time offshore build out costs. Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss), Non-GAAP Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA We present Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss), Non-GAAP Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA because they are a basis upon which management assesses our performance and we believe they are useful to evaluating our financial performance. We believe that excluding items from net income that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our core operating results, and that may vary in frequency or magnitude, enhances the comparability of our results and provides a better baseline for analyzing trends in our business. We define Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude the impact of non-cash charges for share-based compensation, special bonuses and other compensation expense, transaction-related costs and adjustments, restructuring and transformation charges, costs related to the Hosted Exchange incident, the amortization of acquired intangible assets, goodwill and asset impairment charges, costs related to the closure of a UK office, and certain other non-operating, non-recurring or non-core gains and losses, as well as the tax effects of these non-GAAP adjustments. We define Non-GAAP Operating Profit as income (loss) from operations adjusted to exclude the impact of non-cash charges for share-based compensation, special bonuses and other compensation expense, transaction-related costs and adjustments, restructuring and transformation charges, costs related to the Hosted Exchange incident, the amortization of acquired intangible assets, goodwill and asset impairment charges, costs related to the closure of a UK office, and certain other non-operating, non-recurring or non-core gains and losses. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude the impact of non-cash charges for share-based compensation, special bonuses and other compensation expense, transaction-related costs and adjustments, restructuring and transformation charges, costs related to the Hosted Exchange incident, costs related to the closure of a UK office, certain other non-operating, non-recurring or non-core gains and losses, interest expense, expenses for our Receivables Purchase Facility, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and goodwill and asset impairment charges. Non-GAAP Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA are management’s principal metrics for measuring our underlying financial performance. Non-GAAP Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA, along with other quantitative and qualitative information, are also the principal financial measures used by management and our board of directors in determining performance-based compensation for our management and key employees. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to imply that we would have generated higher income or avoided net losses if the November 2016 merger and the subsequent transactions and initiatives had not occurred. In the future we may incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss), Non-GAAP Operating Profit or Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss), Non-GAAP Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these items. Other companies, including our peer companies, may calculate similarly-titled measures in a different manner from us, and therefore, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly-tiled measures of other companies. Investors are cautioned against using these measures to the exclusion of our results in accordance with GAAP.

We used a structural non-GAAP tax rate of 26% for all periods which reflects the removal of the tax effect of non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments and non-recurring tax adjustments on a year-over-year basis. The non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix including due to acquisition activity, or other changes to our strategy or business operations. We will re-evaluate our long-term non-GAAP tax rate as appropriate. We believe that making these adjustments facilitates a better evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to prior periods.(j)Primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses and expense related to our Receivables Purchase Facility.(k)Excludes accelerated depreciation expense related to facility closures. Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) Per Share We define Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) per Share as Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) divided by our GAAP weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period on a diluted basis and further adjusted for the weighted average number of shares associated with securities which are anti-dilutive to GAAP loss per share but dilutive to Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) per Share. Management uses Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) per Share to evaluate the performance of our business on a comparable basis from period to period, including by adjusting for the impact of the issuance of shares that would be dilutive to Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) per Share.

(NYSE: DOMA) reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023, showcasing revenue growth and improved profitability. The company launched the Upfront Title product via a pilot program with a major mortgage software platform leader, aiming to address the growing demand for affordable and tech-driven title insurance offerings. Positive Total revenues increased by 11% to $85 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the previous quarter. Gross profit rose by 56% to $5 million in Q4 2023. Adjusted EBITDA loss decreased to $3 million from $5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Doma successfully launched the Upfront Title pilot program, targeting cost reduction and improved customer benefits. The company's strategic focus on innovative title insurance solutions aligns with the current housing affordability initiatives. Doma's participation in the FHFA's title acceptance pilot program highlights its technological and underwriting capabilities. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The financial results of Doma Holdings, Inc. indicate a sequential improvement in key metrics such as total revenues, retained premiums and fees and gross profit. This growth trajectory, particularly the 56% increase in gross profit, suggests that the company's cost reduction strategies and tech upgrades are translating into tangible financial benefits. The reduction in net loss and adjusted EBITDA loss points towards an improving operational efficiency. However, the persistence of net losses indicates that the company is still in a transitional phase and has yet to achieve profitability.From a market perspective, the launch of the Upfront Title product and the pilot program with a major mortgage technology platform could potentially disrupt the traditional title insurance market. If successful, this innovation could streamline the homebuying process and offer cost savings to consumers, aligning with broader public and political interests in affordable housing. The focus on technology-driven solutions is a strategic move that could capitalize on the current industry trends towards digitization. Financial Analyst The mention of Doma's progress towards reaching adjusted EBITDA profitability is a critical metric for investors as it provides a clearer picture of the company's core operational performance by excluding non-recurring expenses. The reported increase in adjusted gross profit by 29% is a positive sign for stakeholders, as it reflects better cost management and potentially scalable business operations. Investors should monitor the company's ability to maintain this upward trend in subsequent quarters to assess the sustainability of its business model.It is important to note that the company has acknowledged the non-material impact of the pilot program's revenue in the short term. This transparency is crucial for setting realistic expectations for investors. The long-term potential for expansion, however, hinges on the early results from the pilot program and the broader industry's response to the FHFA's pilot to waive lender's title insurance requirements. Legal Expert The implications of the FHFA's announcement regarding the waiver of lender's title insurance requirements could have significant legal ramifications for the title insurance industry. Doma's ability to participate in this pilot program due to its technology and underwriting capabilities may offer it a competitive advantage. However, it is essential to consider the legal risks associated with such waivers, as they could potentially expose lenders to unforeseen title issues.Moreover, the political focus on reducing title insurance costs, as highlighted in President Biden's State of the Union Address, suggests a regulatory environment that may favor innovative solutions like Doma's. This could lead to a shift in industry standards and practices, where technology-driven companies could gain a foothold. Understanding the legal landscape and adapting to potential regulatory changes will be crucial for Doma and its competitors. 03/12/2024 - 04:12 PM Successfully launched Upfront Title product via a pilot program with a major mortgage software platform leader Continues making progress towards reaching adjusted EBITDA profitability Core Underwriting platform continues to demonstrate strong performance, benefitting from increased operational efficiency and significant tech upgrades SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Doma Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DOMA) (“Doma” or the “Company”), a leading force for disruptive change in the real estate industry, today reported financial results and key operating data for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Business Highlights (1)(2): Total revenues of $85 million, up 11% versus Q3 2023 Retained premiums and fees of $17 million, up 7% versus Q3 2023 Gross profit of $5 million, up 56% versus Q3 2023 Adjusted gross profit of $8 million, up 29% versus Q3 2023 Net loss of $18 million, compared to a net loss of $22 million in Q3 2023 Adjusted EBITDA loss of $3 million, compared to a loss of $5 million in Q3 2023 “2023 was a transformational year for Doma. As we continued to navigate challenging market conditions, we successfully executed significant cost reduction actions, divested our non-core local agency operations, and streamlined our business to focus on our core strengths and to support our invaluable customers,” said Max Simkoff, CEO of Doma. “We narrowed our strategy to better address the ever-growing market demand for more affordable and tech-driven title insurance offerings, including the launch of an innovative, new product, called Upfront Title.” Mr. Simkoff added, “We are pleased to have successfully launched our Upfront Title pilot program in the first quarter of this year with one of the largest mortgage technology platforms in the country and a major national lender customer. Housing affordability remains a critical issue for the vast majority of Americans, and we believe that by licensing our patented instant underwriting technology upstream, directly to the largest mortgage market participants in the country, while continuing to serve independent agents through our underwriting channel, that we will be able to ultimately lower costs for homeowners. We are already seeing encouraging results, helping to validate that the future could bring a transformational new configuration which can deliver both meaningful savings and benefits to consumers and lenders alike. We believe that based on these early results, that we are on track and if we are successful, upon demonstrated pilot program success in the first half of this year, we would be in a position to expand our partnership in the second half of the year both on a geographic basis, and also by offering a more enhanced Upfront Title product configuration to additional lenders and mortgage technology platforms. We do not expect revenue from this pilot program to be material in the first half of the year; however, we are very encouraged by the early results.” “The public and political support for more affordable housing outcomes being driven specifically through more innovative title insurance solutions has grown significantly, and we believe we are well positioned to address one specific opportunity that emerged coming out of last week’s State of the Union Address. President Joe Biden announced his plan to lower housing costs for the millions of Americans who are struggling to afford the American dream of homeownership, and he specifically mentioned a focus on reducing title insurance costs. In a separate announcement immediately ahead of the President’s address, The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) announced that they have approved a pilot to waive the requirement for lender’s title insurance on certain refinances. FHFA’s Director Sandra Thompson further clarified that this “title acceptance” pilot will waive the requirement for lender’s title insurance or a legal opinion on certain low-risk refinance transactions where there is confidence that the property is free and clear of any prior lien or encumbrance. The pilot only impacts the requirement for a lender’s title policy or AOL and does not impact a borrower’s title risk, since it only applies to certain refinance loans where the borrower has title to the property already. We believe that Doma is one of the only companies in our space who has the proven technology and underwriting capabilities to participate in the pilot program announced by FHFA. We’re excited by the actions taken by the administration, and we share a desire and a sense of urgency to reduce closing costs for borrowers by a wide margin compared to traditional non-technology-based solutions. We think that based on what we’ve heard about the announcements made last week, that it’s likely over time that the majority of the refinance universe should qualify for our more innovative approach to quantifying and helping the GSEs assess and underwrite title risk, and we look forward to further exploring this opportunity. This is a great example of the kinds of innovation that could make a lasting impact on helping to alleviate housing affordability challenges in this country in a safe and appropriate manner,” said Mr. Simkoff. Mr. Simkoff added, “Lastly, our core underwriting platform continues to demonstrate strong performance despite continued difficult market conditions. We continued to launch significant tech initiatives in the Underwriting division, which have been instrumental to our success, and which we believe will benefit our independent agent-focused title production team by saving them time and expense while also enabling them to improve their efficiency through a partnership with Doma.” “While our results fell just shy of our ambitious goal of reaching adjusted EBITDA profitability in Q4, primarily due to the continued degradation of the interest rate environment, we are encouraged by the significant improvement we made in our cost structure which allowed us to get within our striking distance of our goal. Our adjusted EBITDA loss for continuing operations was $3 million in Q4, an improvement from our adjusted EBITDA loss for continuing operations of $5 million in Q3 of 2023 and $11 million in Q4 of 2022,” said Mike Smith, Chief Financial Officer of Doma. “Looking ahead, our focus going forward is currently on growing our revenue and expanding our margins through realization of operational improvements.” (1) Reconciliations of retained premiums and fees, adjusted gross profit, and the other financial measures used in this press release that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) to the nearest measures prepared in accordance with GAAP have been provided in this press release in the accompanying tables. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” (2) Doma has exited the Company’s local retail operations nationwide. Local and associated operations are classified as “discontinued operations” and segregated in the Company’s financial results beginning in the third quarter ended September 30, 2023. The financial results and key operating data highlighted today reflect the continuing operations of Doma, excluding the discontinued Local and associated operations. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Some of the financial information and data contained in this press release, such as retained premiums and fees, adjusted gross profit and adjusted EBITDA, have not been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). Retained premiums and fees is defined as total revenue less premiums retained by agents. Adjusted gross profit is defined as gross profit (loss), adjusted to exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization, and further adjusted to exclude the impact of net loss from discontinued operations, stock-based compensation, severance and interim salary costs, long-lived asset impairment, accelerated contract expense, change in fair value of Local sales deferred earnout, and the change in fair value of warrant and sponsor covered shares liabilities. Doma believes that the use of retained premiums and fees, adjusted gross profit and adjusted EBITDA provides additional tools to assess operational performance and trends in, and in comparing Doma's financial measures with, other similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. Doma’s non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Because of the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures, you should consider the non-GAAP financial measures presented herein in conjunction with Doma’s financial statements and the related notes thereto. Please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations in this press release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The company cited cost-benefit analysis and management time as reasons for delisting. After delisting, it plans to suspend reporting obligations under the Exchange Act. Positive None. Negative The delisting may lead to reduced visibility and liquidity for Voxeljet AG's stock, potentially impacting investor confidence and trading volume. Financial Analyst The decision by voxeljet AG to delist its ADSs from NASDAQ is a significant strategic move that will have various financial implications. Delisting can lead to reduced visibility in the market, potentially decreasing liquidity for existing shareholders. However, the company aims to mitigate costs associated with regulatory compliance, which can be substantial, particularly for smaller firms. This reduction in expenses could improve voxeljet AG's net income margin over time.Investors should consider the trade-off between decreased market presence and the potential for improved financial efficiency. It's also important to note that delisting could make the stock less accessible to institutional investors, who may have policies against investing in unlisted securities, thereby possibly affecting the stock's demand and price. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the delisting and termination of registration are compliant with SEC regulations, provided that voxeljet AG follows the proper procedures, such as filing a Form 25. However, shareholders could perceive the move as a loss of transparency, given that delisted companies are not bound by the same rigorous disclosure standards as those listed on NASDAQ. This could potentially lead to a trust deficit among investors.Moreover, the suspension of reporting obligations under the Exchange Act means that the company will no longer be required to file periodic reports like 10-Qs and 10-Ks, which could further impact investor perception and the company's corporate governance standards. Market Research Analyst From a market research standpoint, the delisting of voxeljet AG needs to be contextualized within the broader industry trends. It's essential to assess how this move aligns with the behavior of similar companies in the 3D printing sector. If delisting becomes a trend among peers, it could signal a shift in how these companies view the cost-benefit balance of public listings. Conversely, if voxeljet's decision is an outlier, it may reflect unique internal challenges or strategic priorities.Analyzing the company's performance post-delist will provide insights into the effectiveness of this decision. It will be crucial to monitor how the reduction in compliance costs correlates with the company's investment in innovation and market competitiveness. 03/12/2024 - 04:10 PM FRIEDBERG, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- voxeljet AG (NASDAQ: VJET) (""Company"") today announced its plan to voluntarily delist its ADSs from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""NASDAQ"") and to terminate the registration of its ADSs with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""). The Company is taking these steps in order to reduce expenses and thereby to further strengthen its financial position. The Company has concluded that the benefits associated with a NASDAQ listing do not justify the costs and demands on management's time necessary to comply with SEC requirements.

After the NASDAQ delisting becomes effective, the Company intends to promptly initiate the process for suspending its reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (""Exchange Act""). The Company intends to file a Form 25 with the SEC to effect the voluntary withdrawal of the listing of its ADSs from NASDAQ on or about March 22, 2024. Following the effectiveness of the Form 25, the Company intends to file with the SEC a Form 15 to deregister the Company's ADSs under the Exchange Act after which the Company will no longer have any reporting obligations under Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act, including Forms 20-F and 6-K. The Company anticipates that the deregistration of its ADSs under the Exchange Act will become effective on or about April 1, 2024.

The ex-dividend date is May 15, 2024. Microsoft aims to enable digital transformation with a focus on intelligent cloud and edge technologies. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly dividend by Microsoft Corp. signals the company's ongoing commitment to returning value to its shareholders. The specified dividend of $0.75 per share represents a tangible return on investment for shareholders and can be indicative of the company's financial health and stability. Dividends are often a reflection of a company's confidence in its current and future cash flow, suggesting that Microsoft is maintaining a solid financial position.Investors typically view regular and consistent dividends as a positive sign, as they provide a steady income stream. It's important to note that the dividend yield, calculated as the annual dividends per share divided by the price per share, is a key metric for investors. While the declared dividend amount is important, the yield offers a comparative value against the stock's market price and against dividends offered by other companies.Additionally, the declaration of dividends can sometimes influence the company's stock price. The stock may often see an increase in buying activity leading up to the ex-dividend date, as investors seek to capture the dividend payout. However, the stock price may drop by approximately the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date, reflecting the payout's deduction from the company's assets. Market Research Analyst Microsoft's dividend announcement also provides a broader perspective on the tech industry's approach to shareholder returns. In a sector known for reinvesting profits into growth and research and development, substantial dividend payments indicate a maturity and stability in Microsoft's business model. This can be contrasted with younger tech companies that may prioritize growth over immediate returns to shareholders.Furthermore, the consistency and potential growth of dividend payments are often seen as indicators of a company's long-term strategic planning. Investors may interpret regular dividends as a sign that a company is less likely to face volatile swings or is not overly reliant on unpredictable market segments.It is also valuable to assess how Microsoft's dividend payout ratio compares to industry norms. If the payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends, is significantly higher or lower than peers, it could suggest differing strategic priorities or financial management practices within the company. Economist From an economic standpoint, Microsoft's dividend declaration must be viewed in the context of the broader economic environment. During periods of low-interest rates, dividends become an attractive source of income for investors, potentially drawing more interest to the stock from income-focused investors, such as retirees. Conversely, in a high-interest-rate environment, dividends may need to be more competitive to attract such investors.Moreover, the state of the economy can affect corporate earnings and, subsequently, dividend payouts. In a strong economy, companies may have more leeway to increase dividends, while in a downturn, dividends may be reduced or suspended to conserve cash. Therefore, Microsoft's ability to sustain or increase dividends can also be seen as a barometer of its resilience to economic cycles.Lastly, it is important to consider the impact of inflation on dividend value. Inflation can erode the purchasing power of dividend payments, making it crucial for companies to potentially increase dividends over time to maintain their attractiveness as a source of real income for investors. 03/12/2024 - 04:08 PM REDMOND, Wash., March 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Microsoft Corp. on Tuesday announced that its board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share.

Negative Restating financial statements can erode investor confidence and lead to increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies. Material weaknesses in internal controls can indicate potential risks in financial reporting and governance. Lowered earnings per share may impact investor sentiment and stock performance negatively. Financial Analyst The announcement by inTEST Corporation to restate its Q3 2023 financial statements is a significant event for investors and analysts. The restatement, which involves a $1.7 million decrease in revenue and a corresponding increase in deferred revenue, signals potential issues with revenue recognition practices. The restatement's impact on net income, reducing it by approximately $700,000 and its effect on earnings per share, decreasing from $0.24 to $0.19, will likely lead to a reevaluation of the company's financial health and performance.Deferred revenue, while a liability on the balance sheet, represents future revenue that the company expects to recognize. However, the adjustment suggests that the company may have prematurely recognized revenue, which could raise concerns about the accuracy and timing of revenue reporting. The restatement's effect on the fourth quarter's preliminary results, although described as small, further emphasizes the need for investors to reassess the company's future earnings potential and financial stability.Furthermore, the expected report of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a red flag that may undermine investor confidence. Material weaknesses can increase the risk of financial misstatements and often require significant resources to address. Investors will closely monitor the company's efforts to remediate this weakness and the effectiveness of its internal controls going forward. Legal Expert The disclosure of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting carries legal implications for inTEST Corporation. It indicates that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. This admission could lead to increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and potentially result in legal challenges or penalties if the weakness led to violations of financial reporting requirements.It is also important for the company to ensure that all communications, including press releases and earnings calls, are accurate and not misleading. The need to amend and refile financial statements suggests that prior communications may have been based on inaccurate financial information, which could have legal ramifications if it is found that investors were misled.The company's proactive approach to addressing the restatement and the material weakness by planning to file amended reports and host a conference call is a step towards transparency and compliance. However, this situation underscores the importance of robust internal controls and accurate financial reporting to maintain corporate governance standards and investor trust. Market Research Analyst The restatement of financial results by inTEST Corporation could have broader implications for market perception and the company's competitive position within the sectors it serves, such as automotive/EV, defense/aerospace and semiconductor. Investors and competitors alike may scrutinize the company's operational efficiency and ability to manage complex transactions, such as 'last time buys' for discontinued components, which were at the heart of the revenue deferral issue.From a market perspective, the restatement may influence investor sentiment towards not only inTEST Corporation but also other companies within the industry. If the revenue deferral is indicative of broader industry practices, it could lead to increased caution among investors when evaluating the financial statements of similar companies. Conversely, if this is viewed as an isolated incident, the impact may be limited to inTEST Corporation's stock.Moreover, the company's stock price may experience volatility in the short term as investors digest the news and adjust their expectations. In the long term, the company's ability to effectively address the material weakness and restore confidence will be crucial for its market reputation and investor relations. 03/12/2024 - 04:15 PM MT. LAUREL, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- inTEST Corporation (NYSE American: INTT), a global supplier of innovative test and process technology solutions for use in manufacturing and testing in key target markets which include automotive/EV, defense/aerospace, industrial, life sciences, security, and semiconductor (“semi”), announced today that it plans to restate its previously issued consolidated financial statements for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The restatement pertains to deferral of revenue related to purchases on behalf of certain customers associated with “last time buys” of discontinued material/components for potential future orders. Preliminary indications are that the third quarter 2023 restatement is expected to result in a decrease in revenue of approximately $1.7 million and an increase in deferred revenue on the balance sheet by the same amount. After also deferring associated costs and the tax effect, net income is expected to be approximately $700,000 lower for the third quarter 2023. After giving effect to this change, earnings per diluted share for the third quarter 2023 as previously reported is expected to be reduced from $0.24 to $0.19. The deferral of revenue is also expected to have a small impact on previously announced preliminary fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter 2023 revenue is now expected to be approximately $27.9 million with net earnings of $1.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share. The Company intends to amend and file its third quarter 2023 10-Q/A as soon as practical. Investors should no longer rely upon the Company’s previously released financial statements for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Similarly, prior related press releases, earnings releases, and investor communications describing the Company’s financial statements for those periods and preliminary results reported for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023, should no longer be relied upon. The Company also intends to file its 2023 10-K as soon as practical and expects to host a conference call following the filing and release of fourth quarter 2023 financial results. Based on the matters underlying the restatement, the Company expects to report a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting.

Positive Improvements in gross margin and operating loss in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. Decline in net revenue for both Q4 2023 and full year 2023 compared to the previous year. Aterian aims to achieve adjusted EBITDA profitability in the second half of 2024. Significant non-cash stock compensation and impairment losses reported in the financial data. Company's cash balance at the end of 2023 was $20.0 million. Outlook for Q1 2024 predicts net revenue between $18.0 million and $21.0 million. Expectation of adjusted EBITDA loss in Q1 2024, with profitability targeted for the second half of 2024. Negative Decline in net revenue for Q4 and full year 2023 compared to the previous year. Continued losses reported in net loss and adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2023 and full year 2023. Significant non-cash stock compensation and impairment losses impacting financial performance. Outlook for Q1 2024 indicates a potential loss in adjusted EBITDA. Challenges in achieving adjusted EBITDA profitability by the second half of 2024. Financial Analyst Examining Aterian's financial results reveals a substantial 40.3% decline in net revenue for Q4 2023, which is a significant contraction and could be indicative of operational challenges or a shrinking market share. However, the improvement in gross margin from 37.1% to 51.0% suggests that the company has effectively managed costs or shifted towards higher-margin products. The increase in gross margin, coupled with a reduction in operating loss from ($22.8) million to ($8.2) million, points towards a more efficient operation, albeit within a context of lower sales volume. From an investor's perspective, the improved adjusted EBITDA loss from ($16.2) million to ($5.6) million year-over-year is a positive sign, indicating that the company is moving in the right direction towards its profitability targets. However, the continued net losses could weigh on the stock price and investor sentiment. The reaffirmation of the second half of 2024 Adjusted EBITDA profitability target is a positive signal, but it remains to be seen whether the company can achieve this amidst the challenges it faces. It's also important to note the non-cash expenses such as stock compensation and impairment losses. These expenses can obscure the true operational performance of a company and investors should consider the underlying operating cash flows and the sustainability of the business model when evaluating the company's long-term potential. Market Research Analyst The significant revenue decline reported by Aterian may reflect broader market trends or specific company issues. If the former, it could suggest a downturn in the sector or increased competition. If the latter, it might indicate a need for strategic realignment or innovation. The company's ability to improve gross margins despite declining revenues suggests successful cost management or a shift towards more profitable products, but it does not offset the overall revenue decrease. Investors and stakeholders should note the projected Q1 2024 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA loss, which provide a short-term outlook on the company's performance. The provided range for net revenue and EBITDA loss sets expectations, but also introduces uncertainty about the company's trajectory. The reaffirmation of EBITDA profitability in the second half of 2024 provides a longer-term goal that may influence investment decisions, but should be viewed with caution given past performance and current market conditions. Economist The broader economic context, including global environment and inflation, as mentioned in Aterian's outlook for Q1 2024, is critical to understanding the company's performance. Inflationary pressures can erode consumer purchasing power and increase operational costs, potentially contributing to the revenue decline. The company's projections for the first quarter of 2024 suggest that these macroeconomic factors are expected to continue influencing performance. Long-term investor confidence may hinge on the company's ability to navigate these economic headwinds and achieve the stated goal of EBITDA profitability in the second half of 2024. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA loss year-over-year is a positive development; however, the company must continue to adapt to the changing economic landscape to maintain and improve its financial health. 03/12/2024 - 04:15 PM Reaffirms Second Half 2024 Adjusted EBITDA Profitability TargetNEW YORK, March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aterian, Inc.

However, for the reasons discussed below, we have presented certain non-GAAP measures herein. We have presented the following non-GAAP measures to assist investors in understanding our core net operating results on an on-going basis: (i) Contribution Margin; (ii) Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue; (iii) EBITDA (iv) Adjusted EBITDA; and (v) Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue. These non-GAAP financial measures may also assist investors in making comparisons of our core operating results with those of other companies. As used herein, Contribution margin represents gross profit less amortization of inventory step-up from acquisitions (included in cost of goods sold), reserve on barter credits and e-commerce platform commissions, online advertising, selling and logistics expenses (included in sales and distribution expenses). As used herein, Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue represents Contribution margin divided by net revenue. As used herein, EBITDA represents net loss plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense, net and provision for income taxes. As used herein, Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense, changes in fair-market value of earn-outs, profit and loss impacts from the issuance of common stock and/or warrants, changes in fair-market value of warrant liability, litigation settlements, impairment on goodwill and intangibles, gain from extinguishment of seller note, restructuring expenses, reserve on barter credits, and other expenses, net. As used herein, Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue. Contribution margin, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered as alternatives to loss from operations or net loss, as determined under GAAP. We present Contribution margin and Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue, as we believe each of these measures provides an additional metric to evaluate our operations and, when considered with both our GAAP results and the reconciliation to gross profit, provides useful supplemental information for investors. Specifically, Contribution margin and Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue are two of our key metrics in running our business. All product decisions made by us, from the approval of launching a new product and to the liquidation of a product at the end of its life cycle, are measured primarily from Contribution margin and/or Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue. Further, we believe these measures provide improved transparency to our stockholders to determine the performance of our products prior to fixed costs as opposed to referencing gross profit alone. In the reconciliation to calculate contribution margin, we add e-commerce platform commissions, online advertising, selling and logistics expenses (“sales and distribution variable expense”), and the reserve for barter credits to gross profit to inform users of our financial statements of what our product profitability is at each period prior to fixed costs (such as sales and distribution expenses such as salaries as well as research and development expenses and general administrative expenses). By excluding these fixed costs, we believe this allows users of our financial statements to understand our products performance and allows them to measure our products performance over time. We present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue because we believe each of these measures provides an additional metric to evaluate our operations and, when considered with both our GAAP results and the reconciliation to net loss, provide useful supplemental information for investors. We use these measures with financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as sales and gross margins, to assess our historical and prospective operating performance, to provide meaningful comparisons of operating performance across periods, to enhance our understanding of our operating performance and to compare our performance to that of our peers and competitors. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue are useful to investors in assessing the operating performance of our business without the effect of non-cash items. Contribution margin, Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net loss, loss from operations or any other measure of financial performance calculated and prescribed in accordance with GAAP. Neither EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue should be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Our Contribution margin, Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue may not be comparable to similar titled measures in other organizations because other organizations may not calculate Contribution margin, Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue in the same manner as we do. Our presentation of Contribution margin and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the expenses that are excluded from such terms or by unusual or non-recurring items. Contribution margin, Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net loss, loss from operations or any other measure of financial performance calculated and prescribed in accordance with GAAP. Neither EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue should be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Our Contribution margin, Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue may not be comparable to similar titled measures in other organizations because other organizations may not calculate Contribution margin, Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue in the same manner as we do. Our presentation of Contribution margin and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the expenses that are excluded from such terms or by unusual or non-recurring items. We recognize that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue, have limitations as analytical financial measures. For example, neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA reflects: our capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or mergers and acquisitions;the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest expense or principal payments, associated with indebtedness;depreciation and amortization, which are non-cash charges, although the assets being depreciated and amortized will likely have to be replaced in the future, or any cash requirements for the replacement of assets;changes in cash requirements for our working capital needs; orchanges in fair value of contingent earn-out liabilities, warrant liabilities, and amortization of inventory step-up from acquisitions (included in cost of goods sold). Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash expense for stock-based compensation, which is and is expected to remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package. We also recognize that Contribution margin and Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue have limitations as analytical financial measures. For example, Contribution margin does not reflect: general and administrative expense necessary to operate our business;research and development expenses necessary for the development, operation and support of our software platform;the fixed costs portion of our sales and distribution expenses including stock-based compensation expense; orchanges in fair value of contingent earn-out liabilities, warrant liabilities, and amortization of inventory step-up from acquisitions (included in cost of goods sold). Contribution Margin The following table provides a reconciliation of Contribution margin to gross profit and Contribution margin as a percentage of net revenue to gross profit as a percentage of net revenue, which are the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.

Launch phase: During this phase, we leverage our technology and other sources to target product opportunities. This phase also includes revenue from new product variations and relaunches. During this period of time, due to the combination of discounts and investment in marketing, our net margin for a product could be as low as approximately negative 35%. Net margin is calculated by taking net revenue less the cost of goods sold, less fulfillment, online advertising and selling expenses. These costs primarily reflect the estimated variable costs related to the sale of a product. ii. Sustain phase: Our goal is for every product we launch to enter the sustain phase and become profitable, with a target of positive 15% net margin for most products, within approximately three months of launch on average. Net margin primarily reflects a combination of manual and automated adjustments in price and marketing spend. iii. Liquidate phase: If a product does not enter the sustain phase or if the customer satisfaction of the product (i.e., ratings) is not satisfactory, then it will go to the liquidate phase and we will sell through the remaining inventory. Products can also be liquidated as part of inventory normalization especially when steep discounts are required.

Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $24.3 million in 2023 from $46.1 million in 2022. Market Research Analyst The Beauty Health Company's financial results for the full year and fourth quarter of 2023 indicate a mixed performance, with a year-over-year growth of 8.8% in net sales but a decline in fourth-quarter sales by 1.3%. The global expansion, particularly in the Asia-Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa regions, signifies a strategic shift towards international markets, potentially diversifying the company's revenue streams and reducing reliance on the Americas. However, the decrease in equipment sales in the Americas raises concerns about market saturation or competitive pressures in the region.The gross margin contraction from 68.0% in 2022 to 39.0% in 2023, alongside a significant net loss of $100.1 million compared to the previous year's net income, suggests operational challenges. The company's financial health is further underscored by a reduction in cash and cash equivalents and share repurchases, which may impact liquidity. Investors should consider the company's long-term strategy to address margin pressures and the sustainability of its growth in international markets. Financial Analyst BeautyHealth's adjusted EBITDA shows a concerning decrease, dropping from $46.1 million in 2022 to $24.3 million in 2023, which indicates underlying operational issues affecting profitability. The inventory write-downs and charges associated with the Syndeo Program are of particular note, as they significantly impacted gross margins. The share repurchase authorization and subsequent buybacks reflect a potential confidence by management in the intrinsic value of the company, yet they also represent a cash outflow during a time of net losses.Investors should scrutinize the company's ability to manage costs and improve margins in the coming fiscal year. The forward guidance suggests a conservative outlook with flat to low-single digit percentage growth in net sales and an adjusted EBITDA of over $40 million, which if achieved, could signal a turnaround in operational efficiency. Legal Expert It is important to note the use of non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted gross profit and adjusted EBITDA. While these measures can provide additional insights into the company's operational performance, they are not standardized across the industry and may exclude significant expenses that are important for a complete understanding of financial health. Investors should consider these adjustments critically and examine how these measures compare to GAAP results to gain a full picture of the company's performance.Moreover, the mention of immaterial revisions to financial statements could warrant attention, as it suggests potential inaccuracies in past reporting. Although characterized as immaterial, any revisions to financial statements could impact investor trust and warrant a closer look to ensure that the financial controls and reporting mechanisms are robust and transparent. 03/12/2024 - 04:10 PM Delivers net sales of $398 million for the full year and $96.8 million for the fourth quarter driven by growth across international markets LONG BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Beauty Health Company (NASDAQ: SKIN) (“BeautyHealth”), home to flagship brand Hydrafacial, today announced financial results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. Full year net sales of $398.0 million increased 8.8% relative to 2022, with fourth quarter net sales of $96.8 million decreasing (1.3)% year-over-year. Fourth quarter results reflect lower equipment sales in the Americas, substantially offset by steady growth in Americas consumables net sales and strong device placement in Asia-Pacific. ""To close 2023, we delivered fourth quarter financial results consistent with the expectations we outlined on our last earnings call,” said BeautyHealth Chief Executive Officer Marla Beck. “While the results reflect a necessary operational reset, the underlying strength of our business remains—a clinically proven treatment, passionate provider community, unique partner portfolio, beloved consumer brand, and growing addressable market. I am confident in the still-untapped global opportunity for BeautyHealth.” Key Operational and Business Metrics Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, Unaudited ($ in millions) (2) 2023 2022(1 ) 2023 2022(1 ) Delivery Systems net sales $ 44.6 $ 50.7 $ 206.6 $ 206.2 Consumables net sales 52.2 47.4 191.4 159.6 Total net sales $ 96.8 $ 98.1 $ 398.0 $ 365.9 Gross profit $ 45.7 $ 66.5 $ 155.1 $ 248.8 Gross margin 47.2 % 67.8 % 39.0 % 68.0 % Adjusted gross profit(3) $ 52.8 $ 72.2 $ 249.8 $ 265.6 Adjusted gross margin(3) 54.6 % 73.6 % 62.8 % 72.6 % Net (loss) income $ (9.4 ) $ 6.5 $ (100.1 ) $ 44.2 Adjusted EBITDA(3) $ 3.4 $ 17.6 $ 24.3 $ 46.1 Adjusted EBITDA margin(3) 3.5 % 17.9 % 6.1 % 12.6 % Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, Unaudited 2023 2022 2023 2022 New delivery systems sold 1,210 1,882 7,013 6,699 Trade-up delivery systems sold 341 185 1,274 1,793 Total delivery systems sold 1,551 2,067 8,287 8,492 Active install base 31,446 25,336 31,446 25,336 __________________________ (1) Reflects the impact of immaterial revisions to the financial statements.

Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights Net sales were $96.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of (1.3)% compared to the prior year period, with challenges in the Americas largely offset by growth in APAC and EMEA. Gross margin was 47.2% in Q4 2023 compared to 67.8% in Q4 2022. Adjusted gross margin was 54.6% in Q4 2023 compared to 73.6% in Q4 2022. Gross margin and adjusted gross margin were adversely impacted by higher inventory related charges and higher product and warranty costs. Net loss was $(9.4) million in Q4 2023 compared to net income of $6.5 million in Q4 2022. The change compared to the prior year was primarily due to gross margin pressures. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.4 million in Q4 2023 compared to adjusted EBITDA of $17.6 million in Q4 2022, primarily due to gross margin pressures. The Company placed 1,551 delivery systems during the quarter compared to 2,067 in the prior year period; challenges in the Americas and EMEA were partially offset by growth in APAC. Full Year Financial Highlights Net sales were $398.0 million for 2023, an increase of 8.8% compared to the prior year period due to growth in APAC and EMEA. Gross margin was 39.0% in 2023 compared to 68.0% in 2022. Gross margin was adversely impacted by a $65.2 million of inventory write-downs and charges associated with the Syndeo Program, higher inventory related charges, and higher product costs. Adjusted gross margin was 62.8% in 2023 compared to 72.6% in 2022, due to the aforementioned factors, excluding the Syndeo Program. Net loss was $(100.1) million in 2023 compared to net income of $44.2 million in 2022. The change compared to the prior year was primarily due to gross margin pressures and the $78.3 million benefit from the change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $24.3 million in 2023 compared to adjusted EBITDA of $46.1 million in 2022, primarily due to gross margin pressures. The Company placed 8,287 delivery systems in 2023 compared to 8,492 in the prior year, primarily due to challenges in the Americas nearly offset by strength across APAC and EMEA. Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights Cash and cash equivalents were approximately $523.0 million as of December 31, 2023 compared to approximately $568.2 million as of December 31, 2022. The change was primarily due to share re-purchases made during Q3 and Q4 2023 and strategic acquisitions made during Q1 2023, partially offset by the net impact of the current year net loss and other non-cash adjustments. The Company had approximately 7 million private placement warrants and approximately 122.9 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2023. In September 2023, the Company announced a $100.0 million share repurchase authorization. As of December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased and retired 10.4 million shares for $30.2 million, excluding taxes. In January 2024, the Company redeemed $75.0 million principal amount of our Notes at a weighted-average redemption price equal to 77% for $57.8 million.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to results determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP""), management utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted gross profit and adjusted EBITDA for purposes of evaluating ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed collectively with the Company’s GAAP financial information, provide useful supplemental information to investors in assessing the Company's operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP financial information or as an indication of operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP, and may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in its industry, as these other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently, particularly related to unusual items. Adjusted gross profit is gross profit excluding the effects of depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense and other items such as write-off of discontinued, excess and obsolete product, Syndeo Program and Syndeo product optimization logistics & service costs. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net (loss) income excluding the effects of expense (benefit) for income taxes; depreciation expense; amortization expense; stock-based compensation expense; interest expense; interest income; other expense (income), net; change in fair value of warrant liability; foreign currency (gain) loss, net; loss on disposal of assets; transaction related costs; write-off of discontinued, excess and obsolete product; litigation related costs; Syndeo Program; Syndeo product optimization logistics and service costs; and severance, restructuring and other. The Company does not provide a reconciliation of its fiscal 2023 adjusted EBITDA margin guidance to net (loss) income, the most directly comparable forward looking GAAP financial measures, due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation, which cannot be done without unreasonable efforts, including adjustments that could be made for changes in fair value of warrant liabilities, integration and acquisition-related expenses, amortization expenses, non-cash stock-based compensation, gains/losses on foreign currency, and other charges reflected in our reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which, based on historical experience, could be significant. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company's fiscal 2023 adjusted EBITDA margin guidance is merely an outlook and is not a guarantee of future performance. Stockholders should not rely or place an undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” for additional information.

Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary BRT Apartments Corp. reported financial results for Q4 and full-year 2023, including a net loss of $1.7 million in Q4, FFO of $0.34 per diluted share, and AFFO of $0.38 per diluted share. The company also saw an increase in Combined Portfolio NOI, repurchased shares, and closed a $21.2 million loan secured by Silvana Oaks. In May 2023, a joint venture completed the sale of an asset generating net proceeds of $19.4 million for BRT. The interest rate on the credit facility was reduced, and a dividend of $0.25 per share was declared for Q1 2024. Positive Positive aspects include the increase in Combined Portfolio NOI by 6.4% in Q4 and 2.0% for the full year 2023, the successful repurchase of shares, and the completion of a $21.2 million loan secured by Silvana Oaks. The sale of an asset in May 2023 generated net proceeds of $19.4 million for BRT, with an IRR of 22% over seven years. The reduction in the interest rate on the credit facility and the declared dividend of $0.25 per share for Q1 2024 are also positive highlights. Negative aspects include the net loss of $1.7 million in Q4, the decrease in FFO and AFFO compared to the corresponding 2022 quarter, and the decrease in average occupancy to 93.4% in Q4 compared to 94.7% a year ago. The decrease in net income attributable to common stockholders for the full year 2023 compared to 2022 is also a concern. Negative The net loss of $1.7 million in Q4 is a negative aspect, as well as the decrease in FFO and AFFO compared to the corresponding 2022 quarter. The decrease in average occupancy to 93.4% in Q4 compared to 94.7% a year ago is also a negative point. Additionally, the decrease in net income attributable to common stockholders for the full year 2023 compared to 2022 is a concern. Financial Analyst The recent financial results reported by BRT Apartments Corp. are a mixed bag, with a net loss for the fourth quarter but an overall net income for the year 2023. The reported net loss of $1.7 million for Q4 2023 contrasts with the net income of $3.9 million for the full year, indicating a downturn in the most recent quarter. However, the Funds from Operations (FFO) and Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO) figures are more telling of the REIT's operational performance. FFO and AFFO are key metrics in real estate as they exclude the effects of depreciation and provide a clearer picture of the cash-generating ability of a company's assets. The AFFO, in particular, is seen as a closer proxy for the sustainable income generated by a REIT and BRT's AFFO of $1.52 per diluted share for 2023 remains unchanged from 2022, suggesting stability in its operations despite the reported net loss. From a stock market perspective, the share repurchase activity indicates management's belief that the stock is undervalued. BRT repurchased 779,423 shares in 2023, which could be seen as a positive sign by investors. Additionally, the dividend declaration of $0.25 per share for Q1 2024 demonstrates a commitment to returning value to shareholders, which could influence investor sentiment and potentially the stock price. However, the reduced net income and the net loss in Q4 may raise concerns about the company's future profitability and could affect investor confidence. Real Estate Market Analyst BRT Apartments Corp.'s performance reflects broader trends in the multifamily real estate market. The Combined Portfolio Net Operating Income (NOI) growth of 6.4% in Q4 and 2.0% for the full year is a positive indicator, particularly in light of the challenging economic environment. NOI is a crucial measure as it reflects the income generated from property operations after operating expenses are deducted and is a key determinant of a property's value. The increase in NOI suggests effective management and the ability to grow income despite external pressures. However, the report mentioned specific properties that have been underperforming, which could be a concern for potential investors looking at asset quality and management efficiency. The outlook for 2024, with an expected moderation in non-controllable expenses and a focus on occupancy, indicates a cautious approach to operations in anticipation of a more favorable transaction environment in the latter half of the year. This suggests that BRT is positioning itself to capitalize on market opportunities, which could be attractive to investors interested in long-term growth prospects, especially with the Sunbelt region's positive migration patterns and job growth. Economist The economic implications of BRT Apartments Corp.'s financial results and outlook are significant, particularly in the context of the real estate sector's sensitivity to interest rates and economic cycles. The reduction in the interest rate on the credit facility and the secured loan for Silvana Oaks reflect active capital management in a rising interest rate environment. Yet, the increase in the interest rate floor to 6.0% and the current interest rate on the facility at 7.82% highlight the challenges faced by real estate companies in securing affordable financing. The company's strategic emphasis on stable occupancy over aggressive rental rate growth in the short term aligns with a cautious economic outlook, where consumer spending may be tempered by broader economic uncertainties. Moreover, BRT's anticipation of new supply impacting rent growth until the latter half of 2024 provides insight into the supply-demand dynamics within the multifamily real estate market and the potential for a rebound in rental rates as the new supply is absorbed. This outlook may influence investors' expectations regarding the timing of BRT's revenue growth and could affect the company's stock performance in the interim. 03/12/2024 - 04:15 PM GREAT NECK, N.Y., March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BRT APARTMENTS CORP. (NYSE: BRT), a real estate investment trust that owns, operates, and, to a lesser extent, holds interests in joint ventures that own multi-family properties, today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. Highlights Reported results for the fourth quarter of 2023 of net loss of $1.7 million, or $(0.11) per diluted share, Funds from Operations, or FFO, of $0.34 per diluted share and Adjusted Funds from Operations, or AFFO, of $0.38 per diluted share.Reported results for 2023 of net income of $3.9 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, FFO of $1.19 per diluted share and AFFO of $1.52 per diluted share.Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was $588,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $2.3 million for 2023.Combined Portfolio NOI increased 6.4% for the fourth quarter and increased 2.0% for 2023 compared to the prior-year periods.Repurchased 206,105 shares during the fourth quarter at a weighted average price of $17.53, bringing the total shares repurchased in 2023 to 779,423 at a weighted average price of $18.47.In February 2023, the Company closed a $21.2 million loan secured by Silvana Oaks in North Charleston, SC and used the proceeds to fully repay its outstanding borrowings on the credit facility.In May 2023, the unconsolidated joint venture that owns Chatham Court and Reflections in Dallas, TX in which the Company had a 50% interest, completed the sale of the asset. The sale generated net proceeds to BRT of approximately $19.4 million and an IRR of 22% over a seven-year hold. BRT’s share of the gain from this sale was $14.7 million, and its share of the related early extinguishment of debt charge was $212,000.The interest rate on the credit facility was reduced as a result of an amendment affected in August 2023, which converted the interest rate index from the Prime rate to 30-day term SOFR plus 250 basis points and increased the interest rate floor to 6.0%.Declared a dividend of $0.25 per share for the first quarter of 2024. See the reconciliations provided later in this release of FFO, AFFO and Combined Portfolio NOI, to net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the definitions of such terms under ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Definitions."" Fourth Quarter Key Themes and Commentary Combined Portfolio NOI, net loss, FFO and AFFO results were in line with the Company’s previously issued full year 2023 guidance and commentary provided with its third quarter 2023 results.Performance at the two properties that have weighed on Combined Portfolio NOI throughout 2023 (Verandas at Alamo Ranch in San Antonio, TX and Bell’s Bluff in Nashville, TN) showed improvement during the quarter.The pace of share repurchases accelerated during the quarter to bring the total shares repurchased for the year to a total of 779,423 shares repurchased for an investment of $14.4 million. To date in the first quarter of 2024, the Company has repurchased 123,061 shares at a weighted average price of $18.43, leaving $7.3 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization. Fourth Quarter Financial and Operating Results Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was $1.7 million, or $(0.11) per diluted share, compared to net loss attributable to common stockholders of $4.2 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the corresponding 2022 quarter.FFO was $6.3 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, in the current quarter, compared to $7.6 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, in the corresponding 2022 quarter, primarily due to our portion of an insurance recovery of $1.5 million from an unconsolidated joint venture.AFFO was $7.1 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, in the current quarter, compared to AFFO of $7.0 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in the corresponding 2022 quarter.Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures for the current quarter was $588,000 compared to $580,000 in the corresponding quarter of the prior year.Combined Portfolio NOI in the current quarter increased by 6.4% to $16.0 million, primarily due to increased rental rates and expenses recorded in the prior-year quarter related to the December 2022 blizzard.Diluted per share net income, FFO and AFFO during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 reflect the approximate 378,000 decrease in weighted average shares of common stock outstanding, primarily due to the 779,423 shares of common stock repurchased during 2023, partially offset by stock issuances pursuant to the Company’s at-the-market offering, equity incentive and dividend reinvestment programs during 2022 and 2023.For the Combined Portfolio, recurring capital expenditures were $1.4 million for the fourth quarter. Including $578,000 of replacement costs included in real estate operating expenditures, the total investment equates to approximately $2.0 million, or $255 per unit. Non-recurring capital expenditures totaled $1.0 million during the quarter.For the Combined Portfolio, average occupancy was 93.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 94.7% in the same period a year ago. Average monthly rents in the fourth quarter increased 4.2% in the fourth quarter compared with the same period a year ago.For leases signed during the fourth quarter in the Combined Portfolio, the Company experienced a 3.9% increase on renewal leases, a 2.5 % decrease on new leases and a 1.1% increase on a blended basis compared with the prior lease. The rent-to-income ratio for all new leases signed in the fourth quarter is 24%. For leases signed during the two months ended February 29, 2024, the Company experienced a 2.9% increase on renewals, a 3.3% decrease on new leases and a 0.1% increase on a blended basis compared with the prior lease. Full Year 2023 Financial and Operating Results Net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $3.9 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to common stockholders of $50.0 million, or $2.66 per diluted share, for the corresponding 2022 quarter. The current and prior-year periods included BRT’s $14.7 million (or $0.61 per diluted share) and $64.5 million (or $3.43 per diluted share), respectively, of gains from the sales of property owned by unconsolidated subsidiaries.FFO was $22.6 million, or $1.19 per diluted share, in 2023, compared to $23.2 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, in 2022 quarter.AFFO was $28.9 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, in 2023, compared to AFFO of $28.4 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, in 2022 quarter.Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures for 2023 was $2.3 million compared to $1.9 million in 2022.Combined Portfolio NOI in 2023 increased by 2.0% to $62.0 million, primarily due to increased rental rates partially offset by higher insurance expenses. The Company estimates that if the two properties noted above were excluded, Combined Portfolio NOI would have increased by 3.9%.Diluted per share net income, FFO and AFFO during 2023 reflect the share repurchase and stock issuance activity noted above.For the Combined Portfolio, recurring capital expenditures were $5.4 million for 2023. Including $305,000 of replacement costs included in real estate operating expenditures, the total investment equates to approximately $5.7 million, or $742 per unit. Non-recurring capital expenditures totaled $5.1 million in 2023. Debt Metrics and LiquidityAt December 31, 2023, BRT’s available liquidity was approximately $83.5 million, comprised of $23.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $60.0 million available under its credit facility. At December 31, 2023, BRT’s consolidated and unconsolidated mortgage debt had a weighted average interest rate of 4.02% and a weighted average remaining term to maturity of 6.8 years. At March 1, 2024, BRT’s available liquidity was approximately $81.2 million, including $21.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and up to $60.0 million available under its credit facility. At March 1, 2024, the interest rate on the facility was 7.82%. First Quarter 2024 DividendThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend on the Company’s common stock of $0.25 per share. The dividend is payable on April 4, 2024, to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 27, 2024. Full Year 2024 OutlookIn lieu of specific guidance ranges for net income, FFO and AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2024, BRT has provided an outlook and assumptions for its operations, potential transaction activity and capital markets activity. The Company anticipates the following: The operational environment in BRT’s Combined Portfolio is expected to be consistent with other Sunbelt-focused operators with new supply muting new and renewal lease rent growth until at least the second half of 2024 as the new supply is absorbed.BRT intends to emphasize stable average occupancy within the portfolio until it can achieve a lift in rental rates.Controllable expense growth is expected to grow modestly compared to 2023 and non-controllable expenses, particularly insurance, are expected to moderate somewhat compared to 2023.BRT’s balance sheet has no debt maturities until the third quarter of 2025, improved pricing and full availability on its credit facility and ample liquidity to deploy.The recently completed 240-unit Stono Oaks development in Johns Island, SC, of which BRT owns a 17.45% interest, is in lease up and is anticipated to lead to a drag on earnings from equity in unconsolidated joint ventures as the Company begins recognizing depreciation and interest expense associated with the development.A more favorable transaction environment in the second half of 2024 with smaller, private operators experiencing capital, ownership and/or refinancing challenges. The Company remains patient on asset growth in the near term but is cautiously optimistic that it may find new opportunities to deploy its available liquidity for rescue capital situations and/or asset acquisitions in late 2024 and into 2025.Long-term, the Company believes the Sunbelt offers compelling advantages due to the predominance of pro-business states, along with better population and job growth from migration patterns and business investment.With new supply growth expected to moderate in Sunbelt markets in 2025 and 2026, the Company expects a disciplined capital allocation strategy, a focus on stabilizing occupancy in a challenging leasing environment during 2024 and a pipeline of new investment opportunities to translate from a bridge year in 2024 to better growth in 2025 and 2026.

Supplemental Financial InformationIn an effort to enhance its financial disclosures to investors, BRT has posted a supplemental financial information report which can be accessed on the Company’s investor relations website under the caption “Financials – Quarterly Results.” When available, the Company will post a transcript of its quarterly earnings call to the Quarterly Results page. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresBRT discloses FFO, AFFO, NOI and Combined Portfolio NOI because it believes that such metrics are widely recognized and appropriate measure of the performance of an equity REIT. BRT computes FFO in accordance with the “White Paper on Funds from Operations” issued by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and NAREIT's related guidance. FFO is defined in the White Paper as net income (calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles), excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. BRT computes AFFO by adjusting FFO for loss on extinguishment of debt, straight-line rent accruals, restricted stock and RSU compensation expense, fair value adjustment of mortgage debt, gain on insurance recovery, insurance recovery from casualty loss and deferred mortgage and debt costs (including, in each case as applicable, from its share of its unconsolidated joint ventures). Since the NAREIT White Paper does not provide guidelines for computing AFFO, the computation of AFFO may vary from one REIT to another. BRT computes NOI by adjusting net income (loss) to (a) add back (1) depreciation expense, (2) general and administrative expenses, (3) interest expense, (4) loss on extinguishment of debt, (5) equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated joint ventures and equity in earnings from the sale of unconsolidated joint venture, (6) provision for taxes, (7) the impact of non-controlling interests, and (b) deduct (1) other income, (2) gain on sale of real estate, (3) insurance recovery of casualty loss, and (4) gain on insurance recoveries related to casualty loss. BRT defines “Combined Portfolio” as the consolidated same store properties, the unconsolidated same store properties presented on a pro rata share basis, and the other multifamily properties that BRT currently owns presented at 100% ownership for all periods presented. The Combined Portfolio includes 28 properties totaling 7,707 units for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. BRT defines “blended rate” as the average of the percentage change in effective rent of lease renewals and new leases on a combined basis. The pro rata share reflects BRT’s percentage equity interest in the applicable subsidiary. BRT uses pro rata share to help provide a better understanding of the impact of its unconsolidated joint ventures on its operations. However, the use of pro rata information has limitations. Among other things, as a result of the allocation/distribution provisions of the agreements governing the unconsolidated joint ventures, BRT’s share of the gain/loss with respect to such venture may be different than (and generally less than that) implied by its percentage equity interest therein. Further, the use of pro rata share is not representative of its operations and accounts as presented in accordance with GAAP. The accounts and results for remaining properties in which the partner interest was purchased by BRT had previously been reflected in our unconsolidated results for the entirety of the periods being presented. As a result, in order to help ensure the comparability of our Combined Portfolio NOI for the periods presented, we are including 100% of the NOI of these properties for the periods prior to their acquisition of the partners’ interests. BRT believes that FFO, AFFO, NOI and Combined Portfolio NOI are useful and standard supplemental measures of the operating performance for equity REITs and are used frequently by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating equity REITs, many of which present such metrics when reporting their operating results. FFO and AFFO are intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, which assures that the value of real estate assets diminish predictability over time. In fact, real estate values have historically risen and fallen with market conditions. As a result, BRT believes that FFO and AFFO provide a performance measure that when compared year-over-year, should reflect the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, interest costs and other matters without the inclusion of depreciation and amortization, providing a perspective that may not be necessarily apparent from net income. BRT also considers FFO, AFFO and NOI to be useful in evaluating property acquisitions and dispositions. BRT views Combined Portfolio NOI as an important measure of operating performance because it allows a comparison of operating results of properties owned for the entirety of the current and comparable periods and therefore eliminates variations caused by acquisitions, dispositions or partner buyouts during the periods. FFO, AFFO, NOI and Combined Portfolio NOI do not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP. FFO, AFFO, NOI and Combined Portfolio NOI should not be considered to be an alternative to net income as a reliable measure of BRT’s operating performance; nor should FFO, AFFO, NOI and Combined Portfolio NOI be considered an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities (as defined by GAAP) as measures of liquidity. Further, because there is no industry standard definition of NOI and practice is divergent across the industry, the computation of NOI may from one REIT to another.

(NASDAQ: CORZ) reported strong financial results for fiscal year 2023, earning 19,274 bitcoins and operating a total hash rate of 23.2 EH/s. Despite a decrease in total revenue, the company saw an improvement in adjusted EBITDA and net loss. The company's CEO, Adam Sullivan, highlighted the growth plan for self-mining hash rate and the strategic contract with CoreWeave, Inc. for AI computing demands. Positive Core Scientific reported a total revenue of $141.9 million for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, representing a $20.7 million increase from the previous year. The company achieved an adjusted EBITDA of $57.5 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, showing significant growth compared to the same period in 2022. Despite a decrease in total revenue for fiscal year 2023, Core Scientific reported an improvement in adjusted EBITDA to $170.0 million, showcasing strong financial performance. Core Scientific's CEO, Adam Sullivan, emphasized the company's position as a leader in bitcoin mining in North America and highlighted plans for self-mining growth and expansion into AI computing. The company has completed all 2024 payments for new bitcoin miners and is accelerating the deployment of new Bitmain S21 miners to enhance profitability. Core Scientific's financial results reflect a strategic focus on improving operational efficiency, rationalizing hosting client base, and optimizing miner locations in data centers. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Core Scientific, Inc. indicate a mixed performance with both positive and negative aspects. The increase in total revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 by 17% compared to the same period in the prior year suggests an upward trajectory in the company's earnings potential. This is significant as it reflects the company's ability to grow its revenue streams despite the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market.However, the net loss of $195.7 million in the same quarter, despite being an improvement from the previous year, raises concerns about the company's current profitability. It is important to note that the net loss includes non-cash impairment charges, which can be a strategic accounting measure to adjust the value of assets on the balance sheet. The improved adjusted EBITDA, which excludes these non-cash items, indicates better operational efficiency and could be a more reliable indicator of the company's financial health.The decrease in total revenue for the fiscal year 2023 by 22% compared to the previous year may be alarming to stakeholders, as it implies a contraction in the company's business scale. This decline is partially attributed to the company's strategic exit from the equipment sales business, which may have been a lower-margin or less strategic segment. A closer examination of the company's cost structure, which shows a decrease in cost of revenue and operating expenses, suggests that the company is actively managing its expenses to improve profitability. Market Research Analyst Core Scientific's strategic positioning as the leading self-miner of bitcoin in North America and its ownership of the largest bitcoin mining infrastructure in terms of operating megawatts are considerable competitive advantages. The company's focus on energy efficiency improvements and the development of a growth plan for more than 20 EH/s of new self-mining hash rate are forward-looking steps that may position it well for the upcoming bitcoin halving event, which historically impacts mining profitability.Furthermore, the company's diversification into hosting services with a strategic contract with CoreWeave, Inc. suggests an adaptive business model that is not solely reliant on bitcoin mining. This diversification into high-performance computing, particularly for AI computing demands, can be seen as a hedge against the volatility of cryptocurrency markets, potentially stabilizing revenue streams.However, the termination of contracts with less profitable hosting clients and the rationalization of the hosting client base indicate a strategic pivot that may affect short-term revenue but could lead to improved profitability in the long run. Investors may view such strategic realignments positively if they lead to a more sustainable and focused business model. Cryptocurrency Expert Core Scientific's focus on improving self-mining fleet energy efficiency to 27.94 joules per terahash is a noteworthy development within the cryptocurrency mining industry. Energy efficiency is a critical factor in mining profitability, especially in light of rising energy costs and environmental concerns. The company's ability to mine 19,274 bitcoins while operating a hash rate of 23.2 EH/s demonstrates significant operational capability in a market where increased global Bitcoin network hash rate typically translates to higher mining difficulty.The company's proactive management of financial obligations, such as completing all 2024 payments for new bitcoin miners and accelerating the delivery and deployment of Bitmain S21 miners, indicates a strong liquidity position and operational readiness. This could be advantageous in maintaining competitive hash rates and capitalizing on favorable market conditions.The mention of the upcoming bitcoin halving, an event that reduces the reward for mining new blocks, is critical. This event typically leads to increased volatility in the bitcoin market and can significantly impact the profitability of mining operations. Core Scientific's preparation for this event, through fleet refreshment and scale-up plans, suggests strategic foresight that may mitigate the potential negative effects of the halving on the company's operations. 03/12/2024 - 04:10 PM Fiscal Year 2023 Highlights A total of 19,274 bitcoin earned in our data centers; 13,762 bitcoin by self-mining for our account, more than any other publicly listed miner in North America, and an estimated 5,512 for our hosting clients’ accounts Operated total hash rate of 23.2 EH/s, consisting of 16.9 EH/s self-mining and 6.3 EH/s hosting Owned and managed 724 megawatts of infrastructure, the largest owned infrastructure footprint among publicly listed miners in North America Improved average self-mining fleet energy efficiency to 27.94 joules per terahash Developed organic growth plan for more than 20 EH/s of new self-mining hash rate AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Core Scientific, Inc. (NASDAQ: CORZ), a leader in bitcoin mining and digital infrastructure for emerging high-value compute, reported its financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023.

We have now emerged from our restructuring a stronger, more focused and more productive company with a plan for self-mining growth of more than 20 exahash.” “We believe our growth plan and diversified platform give us the ability to refresh our fleet with more efficient miners, scale our business with favorable economics and position ourselves well for the upcoming halving and beyond,” Mr. Sullivan continued. “Coming off our strong operating performance in the fourth quarter, we have seen bitcoin prices rise and our self-mining operation continue to perform well as we are able to take advantage of excellent industry fundamentals.” The Company has completed all 2024 payments for new bitcoin miners ordered for the current year and is accelerating the delivery and deployment of new Bitmain S21 miners. In addition, Core Scientific has improved financial results by rationalizing its hosting client base, instituting proceeds sharing contracts, reducing operating expenses and optimizing the location of miners in its data centers to increase profitability. “Our strong momentum continued into 2024 as we recently announced the expansion of our hosting business with a strategic, long-term contract with CoreWeave, Inc., a leading specialized GPU cloud provider. While our continued focus remains squarely on bitcoin mining, this new contract broadens our revenue model to customers engaged in rapidly growing, high-performance computing supporting the rapid expansion of AI computing demands. More importantly, this contract enhances shareholder value,” added Mr. Sullivan. “We could not be more excited at this point in Core Scientific’s history, as we have secured a renewed opportunity to demonstrate the value of our platform and the strategic nature of our footprint to the future of high-value compute.” Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results (Compared to Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2022) Total revenue of $141.9 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 increased by $20.7 million, or 17%, from $121.3 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in total revenue was driven primarily by a $37.7 million increase in digital asset mining revenue due to new miners deployed in 2023 and the increase in the price of bitcoin, partially offset by a $12.9 million decrease in hosting revenue due primarily to the termination of contracts for several customers in the portfolio with less profitable hosting rates, and a $4.2 million decrease in equipment sales driven by the Company’s exit from the equipment sales business. Cost of revenue of $102.6 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 decreased by $65.9 million, or 39%, from $168.5 million for the same period in the prior year. As a percentage of total revenue, cost of revenue totaled 72% and 139% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to $37.6 million of decreased depreciation expense driven by a fiscal 2022 non-cash impairment adjustment to the depreciable base for the deployed self-mining units, $23.7 million of lower power costs, and $3.1 million of lower equipment sales costs due to our exit from the equipment sales business in 2022. Total operating expenses of $30.0 million in fiscal fourth quarter 2023 decreased $12.6 million from total operating expenses of $42.6 million for the fiscal fourth quarter 2022. This decrease was due primarily to a $10.0 million decrease in advisor fees, a $4.3 million reduction in professional fees primarily related to investments made to support public company compliance and $3.1 million of lower bad debt expense, partially offset by a $1.6 million increase in corporate taxes due primarily to increased property taxes. Net loss of $195.7 million in the fiscal fourth quarter 2023 improved $239.2 million from a net loss of $434.8 million for the same period in the prior year. This decrease was driven primarily by a $531.4 million non-cash impairment charge to property, plant and equipment recognized in the fiscal fourth quarter 2022, partially offset by an increase in Reorganization items, net of $310.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA improved to $57.5 million in the fiscal fourth quarter 2023 compared to $6.3 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, an improvement of $51.2 million. This increase was driven by a $23.7 million decrease in power costs, a $20.7 million increase in total revenue, and the elimination of $3.1 million of cost of revenue associated with equipment sales. Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results (Compared to Fiscal Year 2022) Total revenue of $502.4 million in fiscal year 2023 decreased by $137.9 million, or 22%, from $640.3 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in total revenue was driven primarily by a $82.8 million decrease due to the Company’s exit from the equipment sales business in fiscal year 2022, a decrease of $47.6 million in hosting revenue due primarily to the termination of contracts for several customers in the portfolio with less profitable hosting rates, and $7.5 million decrease in digital asset mining revenue driven primarily by increased mining difficulty associated with the growth in the global Bitcoin network hash rate in fiscal year 2023 relative to fiscal year 2022, partially offset by the increase in the number of mining units deployed in our self-mining fleet. Cost of revenue of $378.9 million in fiscal year 2023 decreased by $253.0 million, or 40%, from $631.9 million for the same period in the prior year. As a percentage of total revenue, cost of revenue totaled 75% and 99% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to $128.1 million of decreased depreciation expense driven by a fiscal 2022 non-cash impairment adjustment to the depreciable base for the deployed self-mining units, $67.1 million of lower equipment sales costs due to our exit from the equipment sales business in 2022, $41.8 million of lower power costs, and lower stock-based compensation of $20.7 million as the prior year included accelerated vesting of awards, as well as a decrease in equity awards granted during fiscal year 2023. Total operating expenses of $108.1 million in fiscal year 2023 decreased $144.9 million from total operating expenses of $253.0 million for the same period in fiscal 2022. This decrease was primarily driven by lower stock-based compensation of $103.1 million, as the prior year included accelerated vesting of awards and a decrease in equity awards granted during the current fiscal year, $14.1 million of lower professional fees primarily related to investments made to support public company compliance, $10.0 million of lower advisor fees in the prior year and a $9.0 million decrease in bad debt expense. Net loss of $246.5 million in fiscal year 2023 decreased by $1.90 billion, or 89%, from a net loss of $2.15 billion for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to non-cash impairments totaling $1.88 billion which included a $1.06 billion impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, a $590.7 million impairment of property, plant and equipment in fiscal year 2022, as well as a $226.9 million decrease in impairment of digital assets year over year, an improvement in gross margin of $115.1 million, lower operating expenses of $144.9 million, partially offset by bankruptcy-related reorganization expenses of $191.1 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA of $170.0 million in fiscal year 2023 increased by $180.7 million from $(10.7) million for the same period in the prior year. The increase was driven by lower non-cash impairments on digital assets of $226.9 million, the elimination of $67.1 million of cost of revenue associated with equipment sales, a $41.8 million decrease in power costs, a $30.0 million reduction in operating expenses, partially offset by a $137.9 million decrease in total revenue and a decrease in gain from sales of digital assets of $40.4 million.

Core Scientific, Inc. and Subsidiaries Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as our net income or (loss), adjusted to eliminate the effect of (i) interest income, interest expense, and other income (expense), net; (ii) provision for income taxes; (iii) depreciation and amortization; (iv) stock-based compensation expense; (v) restructuring charges; (vi) Reorganization items, net; (vii) unrealized changes in fair value of derivative instruments; and (viii) certain additional non-cash or non-recurring items, that do not reflect the performance of our ongoing business operations. For additional information, including the reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, please refer to the table below. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure because it allows management, investors, and our Board of Directors to evaluate and compare our operating results, including our return on capital and operating efficiencies, from period-to-period by making the adjustments described above. In addition, it provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of net interest expense, taxes, certain non-cash items, variable charges, and timing differences. Moreover, we have included Adjusted EBITDA in this earnings release because it is a key measurement used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic and financial planning. The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature or because the amount and timing of these items are not related to the current results of our core business operations which renders evaluation of our current performance, comparisons of performance between periods and comparisons of our current performance with our competitors less meaningful. However, you should be aware that when evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating this measure. Our presentation of this measure should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Further, this non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies because not all companies calculate this measure in the same fashion. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

With our current strategy of monetizing our bitcoin revenue soon after earning it and changes in accounting standards, Management is no longer excluding these amounts from its Adjusted EBITDA. 3 Includes $1.0 million of stock-based compensation that was provided in severance as part of restructuring charges incurred during the year ended December 31, 2022.

The reported decrease in net revenue by 14.7% year-over-year and the decline in gross margin, primarily due to a lower average selling price and increased promotional activity, raises concerns about the brand's pricing power and competitive positioning. The reduction in inventory levels, while improving liquidity, may also suggest a strategic shift to manage excess stock and align product offering with consumer demand.Furthermore, the appointment of Joe Vernachio as CEO could indicate a strategic pivot towards operational efficiency and product innovation. However, investors might be cautious as leadership transitions can entail a period of adjustment. The company's 2024 outlook, which includes store closures and a shift to a distributor model in international markets, could be seen as a move to streamline operations and focus on profitability. Yet, this may also impact brand visibility and customer experience, which are crucial for long-term growth.Additionally, the significant impairment expense reflects adjustments to the value of assets, potentially due to underperforming stores, which might be a red flag for investors regarding past expansion strategies. The reduced marketing spend could be a double-edged sword; while it may contribute to cost savings, it could also affect brand reach and customer acquisition efforts. Financial Analyst From a financial analysis standpoint, the substantial net losses reported for both the fourth quarter and the full year, with a net loss margin increase from 34.0% to 60.0%, are concerning for profitability outlooks. The adjusted EBITDA margin deterioration further emphasizes operational challenges. Despite this, the improvement in operating cash use and the strong cash position at year-end could be seen as positive signs of management's focus on capital efficiency and financial stability.The guidance for 2024, with anticipated revenue decline due to strategic shifts, may be viewed as a conservative approach to setting investor expectations. The projected gross margin recovery suggests some optimism in cost management and potential pricing strategy adjustments. However, the continued expected EBITDA losses highlight that the path to profitability remains a challenge and will be a critical area for investors to monitor. Retail Industry Expert Within the retail sector, Allbirds' strategic decision to close 10-15 U.S. retail store locations and transition to a distributor model in certain international markets is reflective of broader industry trends towards digital transformation and cost optimization. This approach could lead to a leaner operating model but may also risk diluting the direct-to-consumer relationship that is key for building brand loyalty. The focus on compelling products and storytelling, as mentioned by the outgoing CEO, is essential in a market where consumers are increasingly driven by brand values and narratives.The shift from a direct selling model to a distributor model internationally is a significant strategic move. While it may reduce operational complexity and capital requirements, it also requires careful management to ensure brand consistency and market penetration. The success of this strategy will largely depend on the choice of distributors and the terms of these partnerships. 03/12/2024 - 04:06 PM Allbirds COO Joe Vernachio Appointed CEO as Company Accelerates Strategic Transformation Plan Company Provides 2024 Outlook SAN FRANCISCO, March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Allbirds, Inc.

The year-over-year decrease is primarily attributable to a lower average selling price, driven by increased promotional activity, partially offset by an increase in third-party net revenue. Gross profit totaled $27.4 million compared to $36.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, and gross margin declined to 38.0% compared to 43.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022. The decline in gross profit and gross margin is primarily due to the decrease in average selling price. Selling, general, and administrative expense (SG&A) was $41.5 million, or 57.7% of net revenue, compared to $41.6 million, or 49.5% of net revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase to depreciation and amortization expense. Marketing expense totaled $14.9 million, or 20.6% of net revenue, compared to $16.8 million, or 20.0% of net revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting a reduction in marketing spend compared to the same period in 2022, driven by decreased digital advertising spend. Impairment expense totaled $27.4 million, or 38.1% of net revenue, compared to $3.3 million, or 3.9% of net revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022, resulting from the non-cash impairment of property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets associated with certain of our retail stores. Restructuring expense totaled $1.2 million, or 1.7% of net revenue compared to nearly zero in the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily as a result of employee-related benefits and professional service fees associated with execution of the strategic transformation plan announced in March 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2023, net loss was $56.8 million compared to $24.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, and net loss margin was 78.9% compared to 29.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Adjusted EBITDA1 was a loss of $19.5 million, compared to a loss of $12.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, and adjusted EBITDA margin1 declined to (27.1)% compared to (14.9)% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full Year Operating Results Full-year 2023 net revenue decreased 14.7% to $254.1 million compared to $297.8 million in 2022. The year-over-year decrease is primarily attributable to a lower average selling price, driven by increased promotional activity, partially offset by an increase in third-party net revenue. Gross profit in 2023 totaled $104.2 million compared to $129.6 million in 2022, while gross margin declined to 41.0% in 2023 versus 43.5% in 2022. The decrease in gross profit and gross margin is primarily due to the decrease in average selling price. SG&A in 2023 was $174.0 million, or 68.5% of net revenue, compared to $166.7 million, or 56.0% of net revenue, in 2022, with the increase primarily attributable to an increase in operational expenses due to a full year of operations for stores opened during 2022, including depreciation expense, rent, and utility expense. Marketing expense in 2023 totaled $49.0 million compared to $59.1 million in 2022 and improved as a percentage of net revenue to 19.3% from 19.9% for the same period last year due to decreased digital advertising spend. Impairment expense totaled $27.4 million, or 10.8% of net revenue, compared to $3.3 million, or 1.1% of net revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022, resulting from the non-cash impairment of property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets associated with certain of our retail stores. Restructuring expense in 2023 totaled $6.8 million, or 2.7% of net revenue, compared to $0.8 million, or 0.3% of net revenue, in the same period in 2022, primarily as a result of higher professional fees and employee-related expenses associated with the execution of the strategic transformation plan announced in March 2023. Net loss in 2023 was $152.5 million compared to $101.4 million in 2022, and net loss margin was 60.0% compared to 34.0% in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA loss1 in 2023 was $78.4 million compared to a loss of $60.4 million in 2022, and adjusted EBITDA margin1 declined to (30.9)% compared to (20.3)% for 2022. _______________1 For a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please refer to the reconciliation tables in the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. Strategic Transformation Plan In 2023, Allbirds delivered strong execution under its strategic transformation plan designed to reignite growth in the coming years, as well as improve capital efficiency, and drive improved profitability. The Company’s newly appointed CEO Joe Vernachio will be leading the remaining work under the transformation plan, which focuses on four key areas: Reignite product and brand: Executing a highly focused brand strategy to drive resonance with the consumer through fresh, innovative products, as well as more impactful storytelling and marketing.Optimize United States (U.S.) distribution and retail store profitability: Driving traffic and conversion to our U.S. fleet, selectively closing Allbirds stores and expanding our third-party wholesale channel. In 2024, the Company expects to close 10-15 U.S. retail store locations.Evaluate transition of international go-to-market strategy: Transitioning to a distributor model in certain international markets to grow those regions in a cost- and capital-efficient manner. In the third quarter of 2023, Allbirds transitioned two regions, Canada and South Korea, and we have subsequently finalized agreements for an additional two regions, Australasia and Japan.Improve cost savings and capital efficiency: Tracking to the cost of goods savings and SG&A savings we outlined for 2025, and optimizing cash. Balance Sheet Highlights Allbirds ended the year with $130.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, reflecting a significant improvement in operating cash use versus a year ago. Operating cash use improved significantly in the fourth quarter and full year 2023 to $4.7 million and $30.2 million, respectively, compared to $8.4 million and $90.6 million, respectively, in 2022. Inventories totaled $57.8 million, a decrease of 50.5% compared to $116.8 million at the end of 2022. The decrease from the end of 2022 is primarily attributable to fewer units of on hand inventory. 2024 Financial Guidance Targets Allbirds is providing the following financial guidance targets for 2024. The Company’s outlook for the full year reflects approximately $32-37 million of negative impact to revenue associated with the transition from a direct selling model to a distributor model in international markets, as well as the anticipated closure of 10-15 Allbirds stores in 2024. In order to help investors best understand the financial impact of the Company’s transition to a distributor model in international markets, Allbirds is providing net revenue guidance for its U.S. and international geographical markets in 2024. Full Year 2024 Outlook Net revenue of $190 million to $210 million U.S. net revenue of $150 million to $165 million, including a $7 million to $9 million impact resulting from anticipated store closuresInternational net revenue of $40 million to $45 million, including $25 million to $28 million of impact resulting from anticipated transitions to a distributor model in certain international markets Gross margin of 42% to 45%Adjusted EBITDA loss of $78 million to $63 million First Quarter 2024 Outlook Net revenue of $37 million to $42 million U.S. net revenue of $28 million to $31 millionInternational net revenue of $9 million to $11 million Adjusted EBITDA2 loss of $27 million to $23 million. The Company will provide additional commentary on 2023 business trends during its earnings call. _______________2 A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to corresponding GAAP financial measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort as we are currently unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty certain expense items that are excluded in calculating adjusted EBITDA, although it is important to note that these factors could be material to our results computed in accordance with GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in the section titled “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for our fourth quarter 2023 and 2022 results included in this press release.

Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from those statements expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to: unfavorable economic conditions; our ability to execute our strategic transformation plans, simplification initiatives or our long-term growth strategy; fluctuations in our operating results; our ability to achieve the financial outlook and guidance targets for the first quarter of 2024; our ability to complete transitions to a distributor model in certain international markets; our ability to achieve our cost savings targets by 2025; deteriorating economic conditions, including economic recession, inflation, tax rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or the availability of capital; impairment of long-lived assets; the strength of our brand; our net losses since inception; the competitive marketplace; our reliance on technical and materials innovation; our use of sustainable high-quality materials and environmentally friendly manufacturing processes and supply chain practices; our ability to attract new customers and increase sales to existing customers; the impact of climate change and government and investor focus on sustainability issues; our ability to anticipate product trends and consumer preferences, including with respect to the product launches we have planned for the first half of 2024; breaches of security or privacy of business information; and our ability to forecast consumer demand. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment in which new risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause our actual results or performance to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Further a further discussion of these and other factors that could cause our financial results, performance, and achievements to differ materially from any results, performance, or achievements anticipated, expressed, or implied by these forward-looking statements is included in the filings we make with the SEC, including our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, and future reports we may file with the SEC from time to time.

Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures or investments. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release and accompanying financial tables include references to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, and not in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results of operations under GAAP, are useful to investors as they are widely used measures of performance, and the adjustments we make to these non-GAAP financial measures may provide investors further insight into our profitability and additional perspectives in comparing our performance to other companies and in comparing our performance over time on a consistent basis. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to net loss or net loss margin as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss before stock-based compensation expense, including common stock warrant expense, depreciation and amortization expense, impairment expense, restructuring expense (consisting of professional fees, severance payments, and other related charges from our August 2022 and March 2023 initiatives), non-cash gains or losses on the sales of businesses relating to our March 2023 initiatives, other income or expense (consisting of non-cash changes in the fair value of our equity investments, non-cash gains or losses on foreign currency, and non-cash gains or losses on sales of property and equipment), interest income or expense, and income tax provision or benefit. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these adjusted financial measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, we consider, and investors should consider, these adjusted financial measures together with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP.

(TNON) reports impressive financial results for Q4 2023 and full year 2023 with significant revenue growth, positive gross profit margins, and increased surgical procedures. The company's Catamaran SI Joint Fusion System was featured in physician training programs, leading to a 312% increase in procedures. Tenon also raised capital through Series A Preferred Stock issuance and debt repayment. Despite the strong performance, operating losses decreased, and the company expects additional losses in the future. Positive None. Negative The company reported operating losses totaling $3.1 million for Q4 2023, and $15.7 million for the full year 2023. Net loss was $3.1 million for Q4 2023 and $15.6 million for the full year 2023. The company expects to incur additional losses in the future. Financial Analyst The reported growth in revenue and surgical procedures for Tenon Medical, Inc. suggests a robust demand for their Catamaran SI Joint Fusion System. A 192% year-over-year increase in Q4 revenue and a 324% increase for the full year are significant indicators of the company's market penetration and the adoption rate of their technology. The consistent positive gross profit margin, reaching 69% in Q4, reflects operational efficiency and could be a positive signal to investors about the company's ability to scale profitably.However, despite these positive indicators, the company continues to operate at a loss, with a net loss of $3.1 million in Q4 and $15.6 million for the full year. This is not uncommon for medical device companies in the early stages of commercialization, as initial investments in R&D and market development are typically high. Investors should be mindful of the company's cash position of $2.4 million and the full repayment of a $1.2 million debt, which may affect the company's financial flexibility moving forward. Medical Device Market Analyst The significant increase in the number of surgical procedures utilizing the Catamaran System indicates a growing acceptance within the medical community. The 312% year-over-year increase in surgical procedures is a clear indicator of the system's clinical adoption. Moreover, the company's engagement in educational activities, such as immersive physician webinars, is a strategic move to bolster this growth by increasing product awareness and understanding among healthcare providers.As the company plans to expand its product portfolio to address SI Revision with its patented technology, it is crucial to consider the competitive landscape and the potential market size for such innovations. The focus on post-market multi-center studies to gather important data is also a proactive approach to validate the effectiveness of their system, which could further influence market adoption and potentially drive future sales. Healthcare Financial Strategist From a financial strategy perspective, Tenon Medical's ability to secure capital, as evidenced by the issuance of approximately $3.85 million of Series A Preferred Stock, is vital for sustaining its aggressive sales and marketing initiatives. The retirement of secured debt with these proceeds is a strategic move to improve the balance sheet and reduce financial leverage, which may be viewed favorably by investors and creditors alike.Looking forward, the company's goal to further expand its product portfolio and refine its offerings could require substantial investment. It is essential to monitor how these initiatives will be financed and the subsequent impact on the company's cash burn rate. Additionally, the long-term value proposition for stakeholders will depend on the company's ability to transition from a growth phase to profitability, while managing the inherent risks of the medical device industry. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM Fourth Quarter 2023 Revenue Increased 192% Year-Over-YearFull Year 2023 Revenue Increased 324% Year-Over-YearSurgical Procedures Increased 179% Year-Over-Year in the Fourth Quarter and 312% for the Full Year 2023Achieved Three Consecutive Quarters of Positive Gross Profit Margin in 2023Catamaran® SI Joint Fusion System Included in a Series of Immersive Physician Webinar Training Programs Attended by Sixty Healthcare Providers in Q4LOS GATOS, CA / ACCESSWIRE / March 12, 2024 / Tenon Medical, Inc.

In tandem, fourth quarter revenue increased 192% to $0.8 million, and full year 2023 achieved a 324% revenue increase to $2.9 million from 2022. Our notable achievement of three consecutive quarters of positive gross profit resulted in full year 2023 gross profit of $1.2 million and is a key performance metric we utilize for internal goal setting. Gross margin followed as well, achieving 69% in the fourth quarter, a striking sequential increase from 57% in Q3 2023.Our results throughout 2023, our first full year of commercialization, were driven by the successes of our sales and marketing team, and a cadence of targeted physician workshop activities including a fourth quarter webinar series attracting over sixty healthcare providers interested in the simple inferior-posterior implantation technique of our unique transfixing SI joint implant. For the full year, we hosted 133 physicians in Catamaran focused training sessions.Additionally, throughout 2023, we successfully secured capital that has positioned our balance sheet to support our accelerated sales and marketing initiatives to advance the commercialization of the Catamaran System. We are appreciative of the confidence in our SI products as represented by our supportive and prominent investor syndicate.

Additionally, we will expand our educational activities to encompass the full suite of applications of our unique technology and we will continue to refine our instrument and implant offerings. We continue to make progress on our post-market multi-center study and expect a preliminary glimpse of this important data in the coming weeks.Over the long-term, our goal is to further expand our product portfolio to address SI Revision with our innovative patent protected technology. Taken together, we are proud of our 2023 accomplishments including the revenue ramp and attractive gross profit from increased awareness and adoption of The Catamaran System.

The system features the Catamaran™ Fixation Device which passes through both the axial and sagittal planes of the ilium and sacrum, stabilizing and transfixing the SI joint along its longitudinal axis. The angle and trajectory of the Catamaran surgical approach is also designed to provide a pathway away from critical neural and vascular structures and into the strongest cortical bone. Tenon is underway with a national launch of this system to address the greatly underserved market opportunity that exists in this space.

Closing a $77.5 million debt facility and repurchasing $50.0 million of Convertible notes improves financial flexibility. Ending December 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $79.4 million provides a strong financial position. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Veritone, Inc.'s fiscal year 2023 revenue aligning with guidance suggests a transparent and predictable financial trajectory, which is often favored by investors seeking stability. The disclosed Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) and the proportion attributed to subscription-based customers provide evidence of a diversified and stable revenue stream. This is a positive indicator as it underscores the company's ability to generate consistent income, reducing investment risk associated with revenue volatility.The restructuring plan slated for Q1 2024, which is expected to yield annualized savings of over 15% in operating expenses, is significant as it could enhance profitability. This move may be well-received by the market as it reflects a strategic approach to cost management and a drive towards operational efficiency. The impact of such restructuring on the workforce and company operations, however, remains an area to monitor.The use of proceeds from the new debt facility to repurchase convertible notes is a strategic financial maneuver. It suggests that the company is actively managing its debt profile and potentially reducing future dilution from the conversion of notes. The end-of-year cash position provides a cushion that might be critical for navigating economic downturns or investing in growth opportunities. Market Research Analyst Veritone, Inc.'s focus on AI solutions positions the company within a high-growth industry. The reported figures, particularly the software revenue and the number of software products and services customers, can be seen as an indicator of market penetration and product acceptance. The growth in ARR, especially from subscription-based customers, reflects a strong value proposition and customer retention strategy, which is essential for long-term success in the technology sector.Investors and competitors alike should take note of Veritone's strategic financial decisions, such as the restructuring and debt management, as these moves may set a precedent in the industry for navigating economic challenges while investing in innovation. The company's ability to balance growth with profitability will be a key factor in assessing its competitive position in the AI market landscape. Economist The broader economic implications of Veritone's financial results and restructuring plans should not be overlooked. The company's ability to secure a Senior Secured Term Debt facility in a potentially tightening credit market signals confidence from lenders in Veritone's business model and future cash flows. This financial agility may provide the company with a competitive edge, especially if economic conditions become more challenging.The anticipated operational savings from the restructuring could indicate a preemptive response to economic headwinds, suggesting that Veritone is positioning itself for resilience in the face of potential market downturns. This level of fiscal prudence could be a bellwether for other companies in the sector, highlighting the importance of cost control and efficiency in maintaining healthy financials. 03/12/2024 - 04:10 PM – Fiscal Year 2023 Revenue of $127.6 Million, in line with previously stated guidance – – Q4 Total Revenue and Software Revenue of $34.2 and $19.8 million – – ARR(1) of $82.1 million from 3,460 Total Software Products & Services Customers(1), including $48 million or 58% from subscription-based customers(1) demonstrating diversified & stable revenue streams – – Announced restructuring in Q1 2024 resulting in forecasted annualized savings of over 15% in operating expense accelerating profitability into the second half of 2024 – – Closed $77.5 million four-year Senior Secured Term Debt facility, using $37.5 million of proceeds to repurchase $50.0 million of November 2026 Convertible notes and ended December 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $79.4 million – DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Veritone, Inc.

(2)“Total Software Products & Services Customers” includes Pro Forma Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each respective quarter set forth above with net revenues in excess of $10 and also excludes any customers categorized by us as trial or pilot status. In prior periods, we provided “Ending Software Customers,” which represented Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each fiscal quarter with trailing twelve-month revenues in excess of $2,400 for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. and/or deemed by Veritone to be under an active contract for the applicable periods. Total Software Products & Services Customers is not comparable to Ending Software Customers. Total Software Products & Services Customers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the quarter rather than on a trailing twelve month basis and excludes any customers that are on trial or pilot status with us rather than including customers with active contracts. Management uses Total Software Products & Services Customers and we believe Total Software Products & Services Customers are useful to investors because it more accurately reflects our total customers for our Software Products & Services inclusive of Broadbean. (3) “Annual Recurring Revenue” is calculated as Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS), which is an annualized calculation of the monthly recurring revenue in the last month of the calculated quarter for all active Software Products & Services customers, combined with Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption), which is the trailing twelve month calculation of all non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue for all active Software Products & Services customers. In prior periods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Pro Forma Annual Recurring Revenue is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue. Annual Recurring Revenue is on a Pro Forma basis, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenues. (4)“Total New Bookings” represents the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts received in the quarter (including fees payable during any cancellable portion and an estimate of license fees that may fluctuate over the term), excluding any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other variable services), in each case on a Pro Forma basis. (5) “Gross Revenue Retention” represents our dollar-based gross retention rate as of the period end by starting with the revenue from Software Products & Services Customers as of the 3 months in the prior year quarter to such period, or Prior Year Quarter Revenue. We then deduct from the Prior Year Quarter Revenue any revenue from Software Products & Services Customers who are no longer customers as of the current period end, or Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue. We then divide the total Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue by the total Prior Year Quarter Revenue to arrive at our dollar-based gross retention rate, which is the percentage of revenue from all Software Products & Services Customers from our Software Products & Services as of the year prior that is not lost to customer churn. All numbers used to determine Gross Revenue Retention are calculated on a Pro Forma basis.

Veritone expects to use the remaining net proceeds of the Term Loan for general corporate purposes. Financial Results for Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 Delivered fourth quarter revenue of $34.2 million, a decrease of $9.7 million or 22.1% from $43.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Software Products & Services revenue of $19.8 million declined $7.4 million or 27.2% year over year driven by a decline of $5.5 million in certain one-time, non-recurring revenue in Q4 2022 as compared to Q4 2023, coupled with a net decline of $1.9 million from our Veritone Hire solutions offset by a 30% year over year improvement in GRI. Managed Services revenue decreased by $2.3 million, or 13.8%, to $14.4 million, driven by lower advertising revenue and spend. Loss from operations was $17.5 million as compared to a loss of $10.0 million in Q4 2022 driven in part by the corresponding decline in revenue partially offset by various cost reductions enacted in 2023. Non-GAAP gross profit of $27.7 million in Q4 2023 declined by $9.5 million year over year largely due to the decrease in revenue. Non-GAAP gross margin of 81.3% as compared to 84.7% in 2022 driven by the mix of revenue year over year. GAAP net income was $12.2 million, compared to $5.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, driven in part by non-recurring gains of $30.0 million and $19.1 million associated with the repurchases of $50.0 million and $60.0 million of our convertible senior notes due 2026 in Q4 2023 and Q4 2022, respectively, offset by the increase in loss from operations and changes in the income tax provision over the same periods. Non-GAAP net loss was $6.8 million compared to non-GAAP net income of $2.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, largely driven by the decline in non-GAAP gross margin, offset by net improvements in our cost structure throughout fiscal 2023. During Q4 2023, Total Software Product & Services Customers of 3,460 was down slightly year over year on a Pro Forma basis principally due to ongoing run-off of legacy Career Builder customers transitioning off as a result of Veritone’s Q2 2023 acquisition of Broadbean. Total New Bookings on a Pro Forma basis decreased by 33.7% to $17.5 million versus the comparable period a year ago largely driven by a reduction in spend from Amazon. Annual Recurring Revenue on a Pro Forma basis decreased 30.4% year over year to $82.1 million driven in large part by the decline in consumption revenue from larger customers, including Amazon, over the trailing twelve months ended Q4 2023 as compared to Q4 2022. Excluding the declines in one-time revenue and from Amazon, Software Products & Services revenue growth would have been 64% year over year. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $79.4 million, including approximately $45.3 million of cash received from Managed Services clients for future payments to vendors. Financial Results Full Year Ended December 31, 2023 Delivered fiscal year 2023 revenue of $127.6 million, a decrease of $22.2 million or 14.8% year over year. Software Products & Services revenue was $68.4 million, a decrease of $16.2 million or 19.1% year over year as a result of lower consumption across our Veritone Hire customer base, offset by the addition of Broadbean in Q2 2023, and the decline of certain non-recurring, one-time software revenue in 2023 versus 2022. Managed Services revenue decreased by $6.0 million, or 9.2%, to $59.2 million, driven by lower advertising revenue and spend. Excluding the declines in certain one-time revenue and from Amazon, Software Products & Services revenue growth would have 44% year over year. Loss from operations was $92.3 million as compared to a loss of $38.0 million in 2022 driven in part by a benefit of $22.7 million in 2022 associated with a revaluation of certain contingent consideration, coupled with the decline in non-GAAP gross profit and increases in certain non-recurring diligence costs and severance expenses. Non-GAAP gross profit of $99.3 million declined by $23.0 million year over year consistent with the revenue decline over the same period. Non-GAAP gross margin of 77.8% as compared to 81.7% in 2022 driven in large part by the mix of revenue in 2023 as compared to 2022. Net loss was $58.6 million, compared to $25.2 million for fiscal year 2022, driven in part by the increase in loss from operations offset by the previously discussed gains on debt extinguishments of $30.0 million and $19.1 million in Q4 2023 and 2023, respectively, improvements in interest income year over year and the changes in the income tax provision over the same periods. Non-GAAP net loss was $37.3 million compared to $15.9 million in 2022, largely driven by the decline non-GAAP gross margin and the net impact of various cost reductions made in fiscal 2023 offset by the acquisition of Broadbean operating expenses in Q2 2023. Business Outlook First Quarter 2024 Revenue is expected to be in the range of $30.5 million to $31.5 million, as compared to $30.3 million in the first quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $7.0 million to $8.0 million, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $9.6 million in the first quarter of 2023. Full Year 2024 Revenue is expected to be in the range of $134.0 million to $142.0 million, as compared to $127.6 million for fiscal 2023. Non-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $11.0 million to $15.0 million, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $37.5 million for fiscal 2023.

About the Presentation of Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information and Key Performance Indicators In this news release, the Company has supplemented its financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Pro Forma Software Revenue, Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP gross margin, Non-GAAP net income (loss) and Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share. The Company also provides certain key performance indicators (KPIs), including Total Software Products & Services Customers, Annual Recurring Revenue, Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS), Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption), Total New Bookings and Gross Revenue Retention. The Company has posted additional supplemental financial information on its website at investors.veritone.com concurrently with this press release. Pro Forma Software Revenue represents Software Products & Services revenue on a Pro Forma basis. Non-GAAP gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of revenue. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as Non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share is the Company’s net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, adjusted to exclude provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, changes in fair value of warrant liability, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, interest income, interest expense, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition and due diligence costs, gain on sale of energy group, contribution of business held for sale, variable consultant performance bonus expense, and severance and executive transition costs. The items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a breakdown of GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and these excluded items between the Company’s Core Operations and Corporate, are detailed in the reconciliations included following the financial statements attached to this news release. In addition, following the financial statements attached to this news release, the Company has provided additional supplemental non-GAAP measures of operating expenses, loss from operations, other income (expense), net, and loss before income taxes, excluding the items excluded from non-GAAP net loss as noted above, and reconciling such non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The Company has provided these non-GAAP financial measures and KPIs because management believes such information to be important supplemental measures of performance that are commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in its industry. Management also uses this information internally for forecasting and budgeting. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to revenue, net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other financial measures so calculated and presented, nor as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Other companies (including the Company’s competitors) may define these non-GAAP financial measures differently. The non-GAAP financial measures may not be indicative of the historical operating results of Veritone or predictive of potential future results.

In addition, words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “should,” “could,” “estimate” or “continue” or the plural, negative or other variations thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements, and any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and are based on management’s current assumptions, expectations, beliefs and information. As such, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement as a result of various factors. Important factors that could cause such differences include, among other things, our ability to expand our aiWARE SaaS business; declines or limited growth in the market for AI-based software applications and concerns over the use of AI that may hinder the adoption of AI technologies; our requirements for additional capital to support our business growth and the availability of such capital on acceptable terms, if at all; our reliance upon a limited number of key customers for a significant portion of our revenue, including declines in key customers’ usage of our products and other offerings, our ability to realize the intended benefits of our acquisitions and divestitures, including our ability to successfully integrate our recent acquisition of Broadbean; our identification of existing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; fluctuations in our results over time; the impact of seasonality on our business; our ability to manage our growth, including through acquisitions and our further expansion into international markets; our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance and keep pace with technological developments; actions by our competitors, partners and others that may block us from using the third party technologies in our aiWARE platform, offering it for free to the public or making it cost prohibitive to continue to incorporate such technologies into our platform; interruptions, performance problems or security issues with our technology and infrastructure, or that of our third party service providers; the impact of the continuing economic disruption caused by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the war in Israel, financial instability, inflation rates and the responses by central banking authorities to control inflation, monetary supply shifts and the threat of recession in the United States and around the world on our business operations and those of our existing and potential customers; and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control.

(2) “Software Revenue - Pro Forma” is a non-GAAP measure that represents Software Products & Services revenue on a Pro Forma basis. (3) “Total Software Products & Services Customers” includes Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each respective quarter set forth above with net revenues in excess of $10 and also excludes any customers categorized by us as trial or pilot status. In prior periods, we provided “Ending Software Customers,” which represented Software Products & Services customers as of the end of each fiscal quarter with trailing twelve-month revenues in excess of $2,400 for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. and/or deemed by the Company to be under an active contract for the applicable periods. Total Software Products & Services Customers is not comparable to Ending Software Customers. Total Software Products & Services Customers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the quarter rather than on a trailing twelve-month basis. Total Software Products & Services Customers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the quarter rather than on a trailing twelve-month basis and excludes any customers that are on trial or pilot status with us rather than including customers with active contracts. Management uses Total Software Products & Services Customers and we believe Total Software Products & Services Customers are useful to investors because it more accurately reflects our total customers for our Software Products & Services customers inclusive of Broadbean. (4) “Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS)” represents an annualized calculation of monthly recurring revenue during the last month of the applicable quarter for all Total Software Products & Services customers, in each case on a Pro Forma basis. In prior periods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue (SaaS). Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS) includes only subscription-based SaaS revenue, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS)” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS) is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to Consumption revenues and the split between the two allows the reader to delineate between predictable recurring SaaS revenues and more volatile Consumption revenues. (5) “Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption)” represents the trailing twelve months of all non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue for all active Total Software Products & Services customers, in each case, on a Pro Forma basis. In prior periods, we provided “Average Annual Revenue,” which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products & Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue. Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) includes only non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Management uses “Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption)” and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to Consumption revenues and the split between the two allows the reader to delineate between predictable recurring SaaS revenues and more volatile Consumption revenues. (6) “Total New Bookings” represents the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts received in the quarter (including fees payable during any cancellable portion and an estimate of license fees that may fluctuate over the term), excluding any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other variable services), in each case on a Pro Forma basis. (7) “Gross Revenue Retention” represents calculate our dollar-based gross revenue retention rate as of the period end by starting with the revenue from Software Products & Services Customers as of the 3 months in the prior year quarter to such period, or Prior Year Quarter Revenue. We then deduct from the Prior Year Quarter Revenue any revenue from Software Products & Services Customers who are no longer customers as of the current period end, or Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue. We then divide the total Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue by the total Prior Year Quarter Revenue to arrive at our dollar-based gross retention rate, which is the percentage of revenue from all Software Products & Services Customers from our Software Products & Services as of the year prior that is not lost to customer churn. All numbers used to determine Gross Revenue Retention are calculated on a Pro Forma basis.

Sanfilippo & Son, Inc (JBSS) issues a voluntary recall of 8.25 oz Great Value Honey Roasted Cashews due to undeclared coconut and milk, posing a risk to those with allergies. The affected product was distributed in select Walmart stores across multiple states. No adverse reactions reported so far. Positive None. Negative None. Food Safety Specialist The voluntary recall by John B. Sanfilippo & Son, Inc. of a specific product due to undeclared allergens represents a significant compliance issue within the food industry. Food recalls, especially those related to allergens, are critical because they directly affect consumer safety. The presence of undeclared coconut and milk could lead to serious health risks for individuals with allergies. From a regulatory standpoint, the recall complies with the FDA's Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA), which mandates the disclosure of major food allergens on packaging.Recalls can impact a company's financial stability due to the costs associated with the recall process, potential loss of sales and damage to brand reputation. The scope of distribution, including multiple states and online sales through Walmart.com, suggests a broad impact that could lead to significant logistical challenges and financial implications for the company. Brand Management Expert In the context of brand equity and consumer trust, this product recall by John B. Sanfilippo & Son, Inc. could have a detrimental effect on the Great Value brand, which is associated with Walmart. Brand loyalty can be significantly undermined by such incidents, as consumer safety concerns may lead to hesitation in future purchases. Proactive communication and effective crisis management are essential in mitigating negative consumer perception. The company's offer for a full refund and the provision of a customer contact point for inquiries are steps towards maintaining transparency and rebuilding consumer trust. Market Analyst From a market perspective, the recall's impact on John B. Sanfilippo & Son, Inc.'s stock performance depends on the scale of the recall and the company's ability to manage the associated costs. While no adverse reactions have been reported, the potential for negative publicity could affect investor sentiment. Additionally, the company's swift action to initiate a voluntary recall could be viewed favorably by the market as a demonstration of the company's commitment to consumer safety and quality control. However, investors will be closely monitoring the company's next quarterly financial results for any signs of recall-related expenses or sales declines. 03/12/2024 - 05:54 PM ELGIN, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- John B.

Negative None. 03/12/2024 - 05:51 PM Company Confirms August 2024 Timeframe Detroit, Michigan, March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions, Inc. (the ""Company"") (OTCPK:AITX), a leader in AI-driven security and productivity solutions, today reconfirmed its expected achievement of operational profitability by August 2024. This forecast aligns with the projections shared during the annual investor event in November 2023, signaling sustained momentum in the Company's growth trajectory. Steve Reinharz, CEO/CTO of AITX and wholly owned subsidiary Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc. (RAD), shared his enthusiasm for the Company's progress, stating, “We're continuing to see a reduction in the need for additional funding to sustain our operations, thanks to our rapidly increasing revenues. Achieving operational profitability by August 2024, if achieved, would be a point where our operations can be self-sustained without external financing which is not just a goal but would be a significant milestone for us.” In the first month of the last fiscal year, March 2023, AITX reported revenues of $61,790. Fast forward to March 11, 2024, and the Company has billed in excess of $349,000 for the month (but not collected), marking an impressive 465% increase. This substantial growth in revenue, coupled with a mere 67% increase in the authorized share count over the same period, demonstrates effective use of capital and significant Company progress. Reinharz added, “The continuous increase in our monthly revenue is a clear indicator of our momentum. We're on track to have deployed over $500K worth of recurring monthly revenue by the end of April 2024, as we focus on completing the build-out and deployment of our existing backlog.” It is important to note that deployed units typically commence billing within 30 days from installation, as this timeframe allows RAD to fully configure the units and obtain end-user acceptance and sign-off. This process is crucial to ensuring that each deployment meets the high standards of quality and effectiveness that RAD's clients expect. To support the completion of older backlog production, AITX has utilized $350,000 in inventory-secured debt from its previously announced $2 million line of credit. This strategic move is aimed at acquiring the necessary raw materials to meet production demands and continue the Company's upward trajectory. In conjunction with its strategic financial planning and in anticipation of achieving operational profitability, AITX has made the decision to increase its authorized share count from 10 billion to 12.5 billion. This proactive measure is designed to ensure the Company has the necessary flexibility to support its continued growth, fund operational needs, and optimize its capital structure in line with its ambitious business objectives. The decision to adjust the share count reflects AITX's commitment to maintaining a robust financial foundation while pursuing opportunities that enhance shareholder value and accelerate the Company’s path to potential profitability. Reinharz elaborated on this strategic decision, stating, ""Increasing our authorized share count is a calculated step towards achieving profitability and more. Ultimately, we believe it’s a bargain to trade the potential of an additional 25% shares with growth that we have already proven we can achieve – now it’s about growing the momentum even further.” The Company notes that an authorized share count increase does not make available the additional shares immediately, does not guarantee all shares will be released into the market and sets no timetable outside of the total authorized share count increasing. AITX's path to operational profitability is a testament to its innovative solutions, strategic financial management, and the growing market demand for AI-driven security technologies. As AITX approaches this critical milestone, the company reaffirms its commitment to delivering exceptional value to its customers and shareholders. AITX, through its subsidiary, Robotic Assistance Devices, Inc. (RAD), is redefining the $25 billion (US) security and guarding services industry through its broad lineup of innovative, AI-driven Solutions-as-a-Service business model.

Announces Liquidation of Trust Account Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Altitude Acquisition Corp. (ALTUU) announces redemption of Public Shares due to failure to complete a business combination within the required timeframe, resulting in delisting from Nasdaq. Shareholders to receive estimated redemption price of approximately $10.1577 per share. Proceeds to be disbursed within ten business days after March 12, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The redemption of Class A common stock by Altitude Acquisition Corp. and the subsequent delisting from Nasdaq represents a significant event for shareholders and the market. The liquidation of the trust account at an estimated redemption price of $10.1577 per share indicates the return investors can expect. This price is notably specific, suggesting a detailed accounting of the trust's assets and liabilities. Shareholders should consider the tax implications of this transaction, as the distribution may be classified differently than dividends or capital gains.The lack of redemption rights for warrant holders is a critical point, indicating a complete loss for these securities. This is a stark reminder of the risks involved with investing in warrants of special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). Investors should be aware of the inherent volatility and risk associated with SPACs, which often hinge on successful business combinations within a set timeframe.The waiver of redemption rights by the company's sponsor, officers and directors is a gesture that minimizes the cash outflow from the trust account, potentially leaving more for public shareholders. However, this also means that these insiders are absorbing a loss on their initial investment, which could be seen as a commitment to the company's decisions or acknowledgment of the challenges faced in securing a business combination. Legal Expert The company's adherence to the timeline stipulated in Nasdaq IM-5101-2 is a legally binding requirement, reflecting the regulatory framework governing SPACs. The decision not to proceed with the Nasdaq hearings panel suggests an acceptance of the situation and a move towards an orderly liquidation. The company's actions must align with its amended and restated certificate of incorporation to avoid legal repercussions.For shareholders, the process outlined for redeeming shares is legally structured to ensure an equitable return of funds. The role of Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company as the transfer agent is crucial in managing the disbursement of trust account funds to shareholders. This legal process must be executed flawlessly to maintain shareholder trust and comply with regulatory standards. Market Research Analyst The delisting of Altitude Acquisition Corp. from Nasdaq is indicative of the broader challenges faced by SPACs in the current market environment. The inability to secure a business combination within the required timeframe may reflect market saturation, heightened regulatory scrutiny, or a shift in investor sentiment towards these investment vehicles. The impact on the SPAC market could be a cooling of initial public offerings and a reevaluation of the SPAC as a viable alternative to traditional IPOs.For the broader market, this event may signal increased caution among investors when considering SPACs. The performance of SPACs post-IPO will likely come under greater scrutiny and the criteria for business combinations may become more stringent. This could lead to a more stable but less speculative SPAC market, with implications for the types of companies that choose to go public through this route. 03/12/2024 - 05:33 PM ATLANTA, March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Altitude Acquisition Corp. (Nasdaq: ALTUU, ALTU, ALTUW) (the “Company”), today announced that it will redeem all of its outstanding shares of Class A common stock initially issued as part of the units sold in its initial public offering (the “Public Shares”), effective as of March 12, 2024, because the Company will not consummate an initial business combination within the time period required by its amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The Company further announced that it will not proceed with the previously-announced hearing before a hearings panel of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) with respect to Nasdaq IM-5101-2, which requires that a special purpose acquisition company complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of its initial public offering registration statement. Accordingly, the Company’s securities will be delisted from Nasdaq. In connection with the liquidation of the trust account, as of the close of business on March 12, 2024, the Public Shares will be deemed cancelled and will represent only the right to receive the estimated per-share redemption price of approximately $10.1577 (after taking into account the removal of a portion of the accrued interest in the trust account to pay taxes and $100,000 for dissolution expenses). In order to provide for the disbursement of funds from the trust account, the Company will instruct the trustee of the trust account to take all necessary actions to liquidate the trust account. The proceeds of the trust account will be held in a non-interest bearing account while awaiting disbursement to the holders of the Public Shares. Record holders may redeem their Public Shares for their pro rata portion of the proceeds of the trust account upon presentation of their respective share or unit certificates or other delivery of their Public Shares or units to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company’s transfer agent. Beneficial owners of Public Shares held in “street name” will not need to take any action in order to receive the redemption amount. The redemption of the Public Shares is expected to be completed within ten business days after March 12, 2024. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company’s warrants. The Company’s sponsor, officers, and directors have waived their redemption rights with respect to the shares of common stock issued to them prior to the Company’s initial public offering. The Company expects that Nasdaq will file a Form 25 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) to delist its securities on or about March 12, 2024.

(TSXV: CCMI) (OTCQB: RIINF) (""CCMI"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to report that it has received additional revenues for the Company from the sale of stockpiled copper, gold and silver mineralized material at the Bull River Mine (""BRM"") project near Cranbrook, BC. During the month of February 2024, the Company trucked 897 wet metric tonnes (""wmt"") of mineralized material to New Afton under an Ore Purchase Agreement (""OPA"") (see press release dated October 5, 2023, on Sedar+) and the Company received a provisional payment of approximately US$66,000 for the February shipments.To-date the Company has trucked 977 wmt of mineralized material from the BRM to New Afton. The Company temporarily suspended trucking following the imposition of road restrictions in the last week of February. Road restrictions to 70% of normal loads has a negative impact on the economies of trucking. The Company will resume trucking once road restrictions are removed. Road restrictions were imposed approximately two months earlier than normal by the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure of British Columbia due to mild winter conditions in the Cranbrook area.The mineralized material sent to New Afton in February 2024 was a combination of coarse material and fine material, but primarily fine material. There are approximately 45,000 tonnes of mineralized material on surface that has been screened and crushed by our contractor. To-date no mineralized material has been sent to the Steinert KSS 100 ore sorter pending commissioning by Steinert personnel. Steinert personnel arrived at the BRM on Tuesday, March 12, 2024, and have begun the commissioning process with BRM personnel. Once the ore sorter is commissioned, the Company will begin sending coarse mineralized material to the ore sorter for up-grading prior to trucking to New Afton. The Company expects that 40% to 50% of the coarse material is non-economical and only the higher-grade material will be sent to New Afton. Fine material will not be sent to the ore sorter. Ian Berzins, President and CEO commented, ""The receipt of additional revenues from the Bull River Mine is encouraging for the Company. While the revenues remain modest, we have successfully implemented the OPA with New Afton and we look forward to completing the commissioning of the ore sorter. Revenues for the Company are expected to increase by sending high-grade, pre-concentrated stockpiled material to New Afton.""About Canadian Critical Minerals Inc.CCMI is a mining company primarily focused on two near-term copper production assets in Canada.

The Common Shares issued pursuant to the Offering are subject to a four-month hold period under applicable Canadian securities laws commencing on the date hereof and expiring on July 13, 2024. The Offering remains subject to the final acceptance of the TSX Venture Exchange. Insiders of the Company participated in the Offering. Pursuant to Multilateral Instrument 61-101 Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (""MI 61-101""), the Offering constitutes a ""related party transaction"" given the fact that insiders of the Company subscribed for Common Shares. The Company is relying on exemptions from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements of MI 61-101, specifically: (i) the valuation requirement of MI 61-101 by virtue of the exemption contained in Section 5.5(b), as the Common Shares are not listed on a market specified in MI 61-101, and (ii) the minority shareholder approval requirement of MI 61-101 by virtue of the exemption contained in Section 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61- 101, as the fair market value of the Common Shares issued does not exceed 25% of the Company's market capitalization (as determined under MI 61-101). A material change report was not filed by the Company at least 21 days before the closing of the Offering, as the Company was seeking to close expeditiously to confirm funds for the Offering. In the view of the Company, this approach is reasonable in the circumstances. The Offering was approved by all of the independent directors of the Company. Neither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release. ABOUT MONTAGE GOLD Montage Gold Corp.

This pool was a cornerstone of the assets acquired from Enerplus Corporation (the ""Acquisition"") that closed on October 31, 2022. Journey drilled 4.0 gross (2.9 net) wells in Medicine Hat in the fourth quarter. These wells have markedly exceeded expectations with respect to both costs and results. Based upon these results, both Journey and its partner have executed a second program in this pool during the first quarter of 2024. Well costs and geological indicators are similar to or better than the first program. All of these wells will be on stream prior to mid-March. Journey is reviewing the potential for additional second half, 2024 Medicine Hat drilling and polymer flood expansion utilizing the proceeds from our recent financing. With over thirty future locations, along with future waterflood and polymer flood expansion potential, Journey expects this field to continue to provide increasing shareholder value for years to come.In addition to the Medicine Hat drilling program, Journey drilled 3.0 gross (3.0 net) wells in Matziwin. Similar to Medicine Hat, the total program costs were significantly below forecast. On November 7, 2023 Journey moved a drilling rig to the Cherhill field where the Company drilled 3.0 gross (2.7 net) wells. The Cherhill program was followed up with 2.0 gross (1.7 net) wells drilled in Poplar Creek. The 2023/2024 drilling program was funded with the proceeds of a flow through share issuance completed in the spring of 2023. Journey has now completed the required expenditures under this program. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Journey had sales volumes of 12,595 boe/d. These volumes reflect preliminary additions from the drilling program as well as the return of previously disclosed shut-in volumes in Kiskiu.Throughout 2023, Journey has maintained a conservative posture with respect to capital expenditures. The Company continues to prioritize its balance sheet strength along with the expansion of the power business, due to the extensive regulatory timelines associated with adding power to the grid. In the first of half of 2023 Journey did not drill any wells. In its previous guidance, Journey reduced its 2023 capital budget to $46 million from $63 million. Actual 2023 capital expenditures, including end-of-life costs, totaled $45.7 million, which was consistent with forecasted guidance.Of the $46 million in 2023 capital, $15.6 million was related to drilling and completions with a focus on maintaining production volumes. Journey's capital program has shifted more towards oil-weighted opportunities by replacing natural gas weighted drilling in Westerose with oil weighted drilling in Cherhill, Matziwin and Medicine Hat. The ability to maintain production rates above 12,000 boe/d with limited capex is a testament to Journey's very low corporate decline rate. Approximately $14.8 million of capital was devoted to land, seismic, facilities, polymer, and end-of-life costs and $14.5 million of capital in 2023 is associated with the expansion of Journey's power business, including the purchase of the Mazeppa facility, building construction, and generating unit modifications for the Gilby project. In addition to all of these development projects, 2023 capital includes a final statement of adjustments from the Acquisition of $5.7 million, which was offset by $5.5 million in non-core divestments.The Company continued to advance its repeatable plays in 2023. The Company has completed a farm-in agreement with a freehold mineral owner in the Gilby area of Alberta. This farm-in, combined with Journey's existing acreage will give the company access to approximately fifty contiguous, gross sections for Duvernay development drilling. These mineral rights are adjacent to Journey's Gilby gas processing facility. These rights are overlain by liquid-rich, Glauconite natural gas production and contain two Duvernay test wells drilled as part of Journey's previous joint venture. The primary term of the option agreement is for four years with a further option to extend the term to seven years. Journey currently plans to drill a minimum four Duvernay wells on this block during the four year primary term, with the first two wells now being planned for 2025. EXPANDING JOURNEY'S POWER BUSINESSJourney has demonstrated, through the operation of its existing Countess power plant, that it is far more profitable to convert its natural gas into electricity, than to merely sell the natural gas at current spot prices. The currently operating 4 MW Countess facility, which was originally commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2020, has already paid out the original investment. Based on Journey's realized power prices in 2022, the average, effective, net realized price for natural gas used to generate power for the year was approximately $9.41/mcf. For the first nine months of 2023, the average, effective, net realized price was $9.47/mcf. During the fourth quarter of 2023, one of the Countess generation units had a mechanical failure reducing power output and resulting in a one-time cost to repair and overhaul the generation unit. With the repair completed, the facility returned to normal operation in late Q4, 2023.Delays in the regulatory approval process, and a desire to prudently manage capital expenditures, led Journey to defer power expenditures scheduled for the fourth quarter. In 2023, Journey incurred costs of $14.5 million to advance its power generation business. $6.5 million of these costs were associated with the Mazeppa project, including the purchase of: the power plant; the land it resides on; the natural gas supply line; and preliminary engineering. The remaining $8 million was expended at Gilby.Journey budgeted $11 million to complete the Gilby power project in 2024. In the past week, Journey received a potential on-stream start-up date for Gilby of October 1, 2023. Therefore Journey forecasts spending the majority of its budgeted capital for this project between March 15 and October 1 of 2024. The building for the Gilby project will be completed in early April. Journey currently forecasts completion of the Gilby project in time for the scheduled on-stream date.Journey has budgeted $6.3 million for re-energizing the Mazeppa power project in 2024. In the second quarter of 2023, Journey purchased the 16.5 MW power generation facility at Mazeppa through an open auction process that started in November 2022. This facility was originally commissioned by another operator in 2015, and ran for less than one year before being shut-in. The Mazeppa facility is located near the community of High River, Alberta and consists of five, 3.3 MW generators and includes switch gear, coolers, and an export transformer. The generators, ancillary equipment, and buildings are in excellent condition as they previously had minimal run time. Journey estimates that the replacement value of this facility is in excess of five times the purchase price. Journey has now purchased the land the facility currently resides on and has also purchased the pipeline, which transports sales gas from an ATCO buy-back meter station. Although Journey continues to await regulatory approvals, all of the efforts to date have resulted in Journey being optimistic that Mazeppa will be re-energized in its current location and looks forward to providing updates in due course.Journey is planning to increase its power sales to the Alberta electricity grid by over 350% when the Gilby and Mazeppa projects come on-line. As previously disclosed in our February 22, 2024 press release, the combined value of Journey's Gilby and Mazeppa projects is forecast to be $70.9 million as evaluated by GLJ Petroleum Consultants Ltd. and effective January 1, 2024. This value includes the full capital estimate to bring these projects on stream. The nature of Journey's asset base is such that it is a large power consumer with power costs representing approximately 25% of overall corporate operating costs. When the Gilby and Mazeppa power projects are on-stream, Journey will be in a position to more than offset its corporate power usage with power sales to the power grid. This will help diversify the corporate revenue stream and effectively provide a hedge against a volatile commodity pricing environment. The extreme volatility in recent in power prices continues to re-inforce the validity of this long-term strategy. FINANCIALJourney achieved Adjusted Funds Flow of $18.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2023 and $66.1 million for the entire year. Commodity sales volumes were 10% higher than the comparable quarter of 2022. The higher volumes in the fourth quarter of 2023 were the result of the full integration of the asset acquisition in late 2022 as well as the placing of 8 (6.8 net) wells on-production from the fourth quarter drilling program. Journey's overall liquids weighting continued to strengthen and was 55% for the fourth quarter and 54% for the entire year. Crude oil sales volumes for the fourth quarter of 2023 represented 45% of total boe volumes but contributed 78% of total petroleum and natural gas revenues. Natural gas sales volumes contributed 45% of total boe volumes in the fourth quarter of 2023 while contributing 13% of total sales revenues. While aggregate sales volumes increased quarter to quarter, the average realized commodity prices decreased by 25% over this time period, and as a result the aggregate commodity revenues decreased by 18%. On the operating expense side, aggregate royalties were higher by 10% in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, which was mainly due to higher average royalties from the 2022 acquisition. On a per boe basis, royalties were $10.45/boe in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to $12.77 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Aggregate field operating expenses decrease during the fourth quarter of 2023 as the significantly lower power prices resulted in operating expenses (net of recoveries) of $19.7 million or $17.02/boe as compared to $25.0 million or $23.64 per boe in the same quarter of 2022. Included in the fourth quarter, 2023 operating expenses were $3.2 million of workover and turnaround costs while for the fourth quarter of 2022 the amount was $1.4 million. Journey's general and administrative (""G&A"") costs were consistent for the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to the same quarter in 2022 at $2.0 million and $2.2 million respectively. On a per boe basis, Journey's G&A costs were $1.74/boe for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $2.05/boe for the fourth quarter of 2022. Finance expenses related to borrowings, decreased by 35% to $1.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 from $2.5 million in the same quarter of 2022. This decrease was mainly attributable to debt decreasing by 35% in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter of 2022. Repayments of both the $23.8 million of AIMCo term debt and $26.0 million of the vendor-take-back debt during 2023 resulted in a lower interest burden during the year. Subsequent to December 31, 2023 and to today's date, Journey has made an additional $6.0 million of principal repayments on this debt. Journey realized net income of $3.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Net income per basic share was $0.06 and $0.05 per diluted share for the fourth quarter. Adjusted Funds Flow of $18.4 million in the fourth quarter was 26% lower in 2023 as compared to the same quarter of 2022, and was mainly due to the 25% decrease in average commodity prices during the respective periods. This resulted in $0.30 and $0.27 per basic and diluted share respectively as compared to $24.9 million, or $0.44 basic and $0.40 per diluted per share respectively in the same quarter of 2022. Cash flow from operations was $31.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 ($0.51 per basic share and $0.47 per diluted share) as compared to $25.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 ($0.45 and $0.40 per basic and diluted share respectively). Total capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $18.2 million including $14.3 million for the drilling, completing and equipping of the wells drilled in the fourth quarter drilling program. In addition, the Company spent $9.3 million on the continuing work on its power generation projects. Journey exited the fourth quarter of 2023 with net debt of $61.7 million, which was 38% lower than the $98.8 million of net debt at the beginning of the year. On December 21, 2023 Journey entered into an amendment to the AIMCo term debt to reduce the two major balloon payments in April and October and to take the remaining amounts and amortize them on a monthly basis. To further improve liquidity, Journey entered into a bought-deal, convertible debenture financing for gross proceeds of $38.0 million. The proceeds of the offering will have multiple purposes, which include: supporting other debt repayments, finishing the Gilby power project and for general working capital purposes. In terms of interest costs, the coupon on this new debt is 10.25% while the effective rate on all of Journey's current term debt (AIMCo and vendor-take-back) was 11.5% for the fourth quarter of 2023.OUTLOOK & GUIDANCEJourney forecasts reducing its net debt by approximately $26 million in 2024 while maintaining production and energizing a new power generation facility. Of the $41 million in planned 2024 capital, $6.2 million was devoted to drilling and completions, which has already been spent to date. Journey has drilled and completed 4.0 (2.9 net) wells in Medicine Hat during the first quarter of 2024 along with the completion of the two Poplar Creek wells drilled in the fourth quarter of 2023. The ability to maintain production rates near 12,000 boe/d with limited capex is a testament to Journey's very low corporate decline rate. Approximately $17.7 million of capital will be devoted to land, seismic, facilities, polymer, and end-of-life costs. $16.8 million of capital in 2024 is associated with the expansion of Journey's power business.The below 2024 guidance was initially issued on December 21, 2023 and incorporated many material underlying assumptions including but not limited to:Forecasted commodity prices;Assumptions of vendor-take-back principal payments, as these repayments are based upon realized WTI oil prices;Forecast operating costs, including forecasted prices for power;Forecast costs for the capital program; andForecast results and phasing in of production additions from the capital program.2024 GuidanceAnnual average daily sales volumes11,500-12,000 boe/d (55% crude oil & NGL's)Adjusted Funds Flow$70 - 73 millionAdjusted Funds Flow per weighted average share$1.14 - $1.19Capital spending$41 millionYear end 2024 Net DebtNet Debt to Adjusted Funds Flow ratio$28 - $31 million0.4xReference commodity prices:WTI (USD $/bbl)MSW oil differentials (USD $/bbl)WCS oil differentials (USD $/bbl)AECO natural gas (CAD $/mcf)CAD/USD foreign exchange$75.00$3.75$16.50$2.75$0.74 Notes:The weighting of the corporate sales volumes guidance is as follows:Heavy oil: 19%Light/medium gravity crude oil: 25%NGL's: 11%Coal-bed methane natural gas: 5%Conventional natural gas: 40%Journey has embarked on a careful and prudent expansion of its business plan to grow the Company profitably.

These terms do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures by other companies. (1) ""Adjusted Funds Flow"" is calculated by taking ""cash flow provided by operating activities"" from the financial statements and adding or deducting: changes in non-cash working capital; non-recurring ""other"" income; transaction costs; and decommissioning costs. Adjusted Funds Flow per share was calculated as Adjusted Funds Flow divided by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding in the period. Because Adjusted Funds Flow and Adjusted Funds Flow per share are not impacted by fluctuations in non-cash working capital balances, we believe these measures are more indicative of performance than the GAAP measured ""cash flow generated from operating activities"". In addition, Journey excludes transaction costs from the definition of Adjusted Funds Flow, as these expenses are generally in respect of capital acquisition transactions. The Company considers Adjusted Funds Flow a key performance measure as it demonstrates the Company's ability to generate funds necessary to repay debt and to fund future growth through capital investment. Journey's determination of Adjusted Funds Flow may not be comparable to that reported by other companies. Journey also presents ""Adjusted Funds Flow per basic share"" where per share amounts are calculated using the weighted average shares outstanding consistent with the calculation of net income (loss) per share, which per share amount is calculated under IFRS and is more fully described in the notes to the audited, year-end consolidated financial statements. The reconciliation of GAAP measured cash flow from operations to the non-GAAP metric of Adjusted Funds Flow is as follows: Three months ended December 31, Twelve months ended December 31, 20232022% Change20232022% Change Cash flow provided by operating activities31,27825,3462366,643106,623(37)Add (deduct): Changes in non-cash working capital(14,099)(3,427)311(5,222)(10,521)(50) Transaction costs-1,266(100)241,489(98) Decommissioning costs1,1971,705(30)4,6953,79624 Adjusted Funds Flow18,37624,890(26)66,140101,387(35) (2) ""Net debt"" is calculated by taking current assets and then subtracting accounts payable and accrued liabilities; the principal amount of term debt; other loans; and the principal amount of the contingent bank liability. Net debt is used to assess the capital efficiency, liquidity and general financial strength of the Company. In addition, net debt is used as a comparison tool to assess financial strength in relation to Journey's peers. The reconciliation of Net Debt is as follows:Dec. 31, 2023Dec. 31,2022%Change Term debt43,76367,580(35)Vendor-take-back debt17,00043,000(60)Accounts payable and accrued liabilities47,21445,4964Other liability - contingent bank debt1-5,000(100)Other loans419419-Deduct: Cash in bank(17,715)(31,400)(44)Accounts receivable(24,734)(29,677)(17)Prepaid expenses(4,271)(1,650)159 Net debt61,67698,768(38) (3) Journey uses ""Capital Expenditures"" to measure its capital investment level compared to the Company's annual budgeted capital expenditures for its organic capital program, excluding acquisitions or dispositions. The directly comparable GAAP measure to capital expenditures is cash used in investing activities. Journey then adjusts its capital expenditures for A&D activity to give a more complete analysis for its capital spending used for FD&A purposes. The capital spending for A&D proposes has been adjusted to reflect the non-cash component of the consideration paid (i.e. shares issued). The following table details the composition of capital expenditures and its reconciliation to cash flow used in investing activities:Three months ended Dec. 31,Twelve months endedDec. 31, 20232022%Change20232022%Change Cash expenditures: Land and lease rentals179113581,74091989 Geological and geophysical73--35163457 Drilling and completions11,1525,47210415,62031,260(50) Well equipment and facilities3,0813,06317,7589,335(17)Power generation9,2773182,81714,4562,996383 Total capital expenditures23,7628,96616539,92544,573(10) Corporate acquisition (cash plus equity)----19,146(100) PP&E acquisitions-112,410(100)6,467120,307(95) PP&E dispositions(6,733)--(5,536)(3,000)85 Net capital expenditures 17,029121,376(86)40,856181,026(77)Other expenditures: ARO costs incurred (internal plus grants)1,1972,509(52)4,8625,035(3)Total capital expenditures18,226123,885(85)45,718186,061(75) MeasurementsAll dollar figures included herein are presented in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise noted.Where amounts are expressed in a barrel of oil equivalent (""boe""), or barrel of oil equivalent per day (""boe/d""), natural gas volumes have been converted to barrels of oil equivalent at nine (6) thousand cubic feet (""Mcf"") to one (1) barrel. Use of the term boe may be misleading particularly if used in isolation. The boe conversion ratio of 6 Mcf to 1 barrel (""Bbl"") of oil or natural gas liquids is based on an energy equivalency conversion methodology primarily applicable at the burner tip, and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.

Financial Analyst The financial results reported by Laird Superfood, Inc. indicate a significant turning point for the company, with the announcement of a positive net income and cash flow for the first time in its history. Achieving a gross margin of over 40% represents a substantial improvement in profitability, which is a critical metric for investors assessing the company's ability to generate earnings relative to sales. The reported growth in both wholesale and e-commerce channels, particularly the 10% year-over-year growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, suggests a robust demand for the company's products. Additionally, the successful expansion in retail distribution and increased marketing efficiency could position Laird Superfood for continued growth and market share gains.The balance sheet strength, characterized by a cash balance of $7.7 million and no debt, provides the company with financial stability and the ability to fund operations into 2026 and beyond. This is a positive signal for investors, as it reduces the immediate risk of liquidity issues or the need for dilutive financing. The outlook for 2024, projecting a 10% to 15% growth in net sales and further margin expansion, suggests management's confidence in the company's strategic direction and operational efficiency improvements. However, the actual performance will depend on the company's ability to manage costs, drive sales and navigate the competitive landscape. Market Research Analyst The shift in consumer behavior towards healthier food options and the growing trend of plant-based products have likely contributed to Laird Superfood's success. The company's focus on coffee creamers, hydration and beverage enhancing supplements aligns with these market trends. The reported increase in wholesale and e-commerce sales, including a significant recovery in the direct-to-consumer segment, indicates a strong brand presence and consumer loyalty, as evidenced by repeat orders and subscription growth.However, the decrease in Amazon sales, although less than in previous quarters, could be a point of concern. It suggests challenges in one of the largest online marketplaces that need to be addressed. The company's strategic reduction in media spend, while beneficial for short-term profitability, will need to be balanced against long-term brand visibility and customer acquisition efforts. Continued innovation and product development, as seen with the launch of Daily Greens and Performance Mushroom products, will be key to sustaining momentum and differentiating in a crowded market. Economist The positive financial results of Laird Superfood must be contextualized within the broader economic environment. The food and beverage industry has faced numerous challenges, including supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and shifting consumer spending patterns. The company's ability to report positive net income and operating cash flows is indicative of effective cost management and operational efficiency, particularly in the face of such headwinds.The transition to a variable cost third-party co-manufacturing business model is a strategic move that likely contributed to margin expansion by reducing fixed costs and improving scalability. This could be a sustainable approach to mitigate the impact of economic fluctuations. Looking ahead, the company's projection of continued sales growth and margin improvement in 2024 suggests optimism about economic recovery and consumer spending. Nevertheless, vigilance will be necessary as economic conditions evolve, especially with potential risks such as rising input costs and changes in consumer confidence. 03/12/2024 - 05:47 PM Positive Net Income and Operating Cash Flows for the first time in the Company's history. BOULDER, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Laird Superfood, Inc. (NYSE American: LSF) (“Laird Superfood,” the ""Company"", “we”, and “our”), today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. Jason Vieth, Chief Executive Officer, commented, ""I am delighted to share that our Q4 results are by far the best ever reported by Laird Superfood as a public company. During this quarter, we increased our Gross Margin to greater than 40%, achieved both positive Net Income and positive Cash Flow, and grew the company versus both year-ago and prior period. These results were driven by a broad-based improvement in our business, including strong execution across our commercial teams as well as by our internal supply chain resources and affiliated manufacturing and distribution partners. We also won significant and strategic increases in retail distribution during the fourth quarter, and saw a substantial increase in the efficiency of our marketing activity across all channels. Heading into 2024, we are positioned to build upon this success. The past years have obviously been challenging to small food companies, and I am proud of the efforts of our team to fundamentally reinvent Laird Superfood and position us as a strong survivor that can win market share and achieve sustained profitability in the foreseeable future."" Anya Hamill, Chief Financial Officer, commented, ""I am pleased to report outstanding fourth quarter financial results. Net Sales grew across both wholesale and e-commerce, fueled by a return to growth in our direct to consumer (DTC) channel, which grew 10% versus prior year. In the fourth quarter, Gross Margin rose to 40.4%, representing a 9-point improvement sequentially versus Q3 2023, and a 45-point improvement versus Q4 2022 as reported or a 21-point improvement on an adjusted basis. Driven by sales growth and strong cost management, we delivered Q4 Net Income of $0.1 million and positive Q4 Cash Flow of $0.3 million. Our balance sheet remains strong, and with no debt and a $7.7 million cash balance as of December 31, 2023, we now project that we will have enough cash to fund our operations into 2026 and beyond and our Annual Report on Form 10-K will not contain the going concern language that was included in our prior quarterly reports."" Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights Net Sales of $9.2 million compared to $9.2 million in the prior quarter, and $9.0 million in the prior year period. Wholesale contributed 34% of total Net Sales and increased by 3% year-over-year, driven by sales growth in Club and distribution expansion in grocery, as well as product velocity improvement behind updated packaging which launched in the second quarter of 2023. This was, in part, offset by strategic investments in trade spend to drive channel growth. E-commerce contributed 66% of total Net Sales and increased by 2% year-over-year. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) returned to growth, increasing 10% year-over-year driven by strong performance in our subscription and repeat orders, as well as higher average order value following the launch of our Daily Greens and Performance Mushroom products earlier in the year. This growth was achieved despite significant planned reductions in media spend in the channel. This growth was offset by a 12% decrease in Amazon sales year-over-year, a substantially lower decline than in sequential quarters, driven by significant planned reductions in media spend in the channel. Gross Margin was 40.4%, compared to 31.0% in the third quarter of 2023 and (4.6)% in the prior year period. This margin expansion was driven by the transition to a variable cost third-party co-manufacturing business model, partially offset by incremental trade spend intended to drive growth in the retail channel, specifically around innovation expansion, awareness, and trial. Net Income was $0.1 million, or $0.01 earnings per diluted share compared to Net Loss of $2.7 million, or $0.28 loss per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023 and Net Loss of $15.5 million, or $1.69 loss per diluted share, in the prior year period. The improvement is driven by Gross Margin expansion, and lower marketing and general and administrative (G&A) spend. Adjusted Net Income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, was $20 thousand, or $0.00 earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to Adjusted Net Loss of $2.8 million, or $0.30 loss per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023 and $4.3 million, or $0.47 loss per diluted share in the prior year period. This sequential and prior year improvement was driven by significantly expanded Gross Margins and lower marketing and G&A spend.

The increase was driven by sales growth in Club, distribution expansion in grocery, and product velocity improvements behind updated packaging which launched in the second quarter of 2023. This was, in part, offset by strategic investments in trade spend to drive channel growth. E-commerce contributed 57% of total net sales and decreased 13% compared to the prior year. DTC sales decreased by 11% due to planned media spend reductions, which was partially offset by an increase in our subscription sales which grew 13% compared to the prior year. Amazon sales decreased 17% compared to the prior year, driven by a combination of significant planned media spend reductions and the negative impacts of inventory out-of-stocks related to the previously discussed quality issue experienced in first quarter of 2023 which was fully resolved by the end of the third quarter of 2023. Gross Margin was 30.1% compared to 14.5% in the prior year. This margin expansion was driven by the transition to a variable cost third-party co-manufacturing business model, partially offset by incremental trade spend intended to drive growth in the retail channel, specifically around innovation expansion, awareness, and trial. Net Loss was $10.2 million, or $1.09 per diluted share compared to Net Loss of $40.3 million, or $4.41 per diluted share in the prior year. The improvement is driven by Gross Margin expansion, costs incurred related to exit and disposal activities and impairment of goodwill and long-lived intangible assets in 2022, and lower marketing and G&A spend. Adjusted Net Loss, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, was $9.8 million, or $1.06 per diluted share in 2023, compared to $22.8 million, or $2.49 per diluted share in the prior year. This improvement was driven by significantly expanded Gross Margin and lower marketing and G&A spend.

Cash provided by operating activities was $0.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to cash used of $3.5 million and $3.2 million in the third quarter of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2022, respectively. The improvement in cash flows was driven by margin expansion and significant reductions in general and administrative costs. Cash burn in the third quarter of 2023 relative to the fourth quarter was due to planned inventory build to meet stepped up demand in the retail and club channels and the timing of accounts receivable collections. Cash used in operating activities was $10.8 million in 2023, compared to $14.3 million in 2022. The reduction in cash burn was driven by the realization of the operating efficiencies gained from the transition to the variable cost co-manufacturing model and the related reductions in overhead and administrative costs offset in part by our Sisters, Oregon exit and disposal costs incurred in the first quarter of 2023. 2024 Outlook Based on management's best assessment of the environment today, the Company is providing the following outlook for the full year 2024: Net Sales are expected to be in the range of approximately $38 to $40 million, representing growth of 10% to 15% compared to 2023. Gross Margin is expected to expand to approximately 37% to 40%, excluding any one-time charges, representing a 7 to 10-point improvement versus 2023.

Management uses these adjusted metrics to evaluate financial performance because they allow for period-over-period comparisons of the Company’s ongoing operations before the impact of certain items described below. Management believes this information may also be useful to investors to compare the Company’s results period-over-period. We define adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per diluted share to exclude certain one-time costs defined in detail in the tables to follow. We define adjusted gross margin to exclude the net sales and cost of goods sold components of one-time costs defined in the tables to follow. Please be aware that adjusted gross margin, adjusted net loss, and adjusted net loss per diluted share have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for gross margin, net loss, or net loss per diluted share. In addition, we may calculate and/or present adjusted gross margin, adjusted net loss, and adjusted net loss per diluted share differently than measures with the same or similar names that other companies report, and as a result, the non-GAAP measures we report may not be comparable to those reported by others. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the table that follows: LAIRD SUPERFOOD, INC.

(TSX: WDO) (“Wesdome” or the “Company”) today announces its results for the fourth quarter (“Q4 2023”) and year ended December 31, 2023. The Company is also providing its updated Mineral Reserve and Resource statements. Preliminary operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended 2023 as well as multi-year production and operating guidance were disclosed on January 15, 2024. Management will host a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday March 13 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time to discuss the results. All figures are expressed in Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Highlights Gold production in the fourth quarter was 36,216 ounces at cash costs of $1,451 per ounce1 (US$1,065) and all-in sustaining costs (“AISC”) of $2,082 per ounce1 (US$1,529).For the full year 2023, gold production was 123,336 ounces at cash costs of $1,579 per ounce1 (US$1,170) and all-in sustaining costs (“AISC”) of $2,231 per ounce1 (US$1,653). Production and costs both compare favourably relative to 2023 guidance ranges.Cash margins1 for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 was $47.6 million and $132.9 million respectively, representing a 80% and 39% increase relative to corresponding periods in 2022 mainly due to a higher Canadian dollar realized gold price and increase in ounces sold.Net income and adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 of $2.4 million ($0.02 per share). The quarter included a non-cash deferred tax impact of $8.6 million but was still $5.9 million higher than the corresponding period in 2022.Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter and full year 2023 of $37.2 million ($0.25 per share) and $101.4 million ($0.69 per share) was 262% and 55% higher than the corresponding periods in 2022 mainly due to the higher cash margin.Free cash flow in the fourth quarter and full year 2023 was $39.4 million and $83.8 million higher than the corresponding periods in 2022 mainly due to the higher cash margin and overall decrease in capital expenditures.Available liquidity of $152.6 million, including $41.4 million in cash and $111.0 million of undrawn availability under the Company’s revolving credit facility. Cash net of the revolver increased by $24.2 million in 2023. Anthea Bath, President and CEO, commented, “We closed 2023 with a stronger balance sheet and performed well relative to our 2023 operating targets. With the release of our multi-year guidance earlier this year, we are now focused on delivering significantly higher production and free cash flow in 2024 and 2025. At Kiena, development continues to advance, successfully addressing the challenges of mining in schist material. Consequently, we look forward to accessing and processing higher-grade material in the second quarter. At Eagle River, we are evaluating potential initiatives to optimize the operation and reduce costs while advancing development towards the 300 Zone at depth. Accompanying our results, we announced our Mineral Reserves and Resources for year-ended 2023, including a 12% increase in total gold Mineral Reserves as compared to year-end 2022. The additions were driven primarily by the initial Mineral Reserve at Presqu'île Zone along with additions to Kiena Deep, and Zone 6 Central at Eagle River. We have an ambitious exploration program in 2024, which we expect to yield high quality resource additions and new discoveries, evidenced most recently by the rapid growth of the Falcon 311 Zone at Eagle River. As we approach a free cash flow inflection point this year, we remain dedicated to meeting our performance targets, and pursuing strategic activities that drive high return growth in the jurisdictions in which we operate.” Financial and Operating Highlights A summary of the Company’s consolidated financial and operating results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 are presented below: (in thousands of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise indicated)Q4 2023Q4 2022FY 2023FY 2022 Financial Results Revenues102,221 75,035 333,173 265,483 Cost of sales78,506 61,997 295,422 214,371 Cash margin147,576 26,466 132,939 95,674 EBITDA138,256 21,309 99,333 55,617 Net loss attributable to shareholders2,420 (3,527) (6,187) (14,706) Net income ($/sh)0.02 (0.02) (0.04) (0.10) Adjusted attributable net loss12,420 (3,527) (1,910) (5,856) Adjusted attributable net loss1 ($/sh)0.02 (0.02) (0.01) (0.04) Operating cash flow37,176 10,267 101,351 65,206 Operating cash flow ($/sh)0.25 0.07 0.69 0.46 Cash flow from financing activities(1,946) 37,307 5,421 57,435 Cash flow from investing activities(25,441) (39,130) (98,586) (146,220) Free cash flow17,799 (31,609) (6,405) (90,174) Free cash flow1 ($/sh)0.05 (0.22) (0.04) (0.63) Operating Results Gold produced (oz)36,216 35,116 123,336 110,850 Gold sold (oz)37,620 31,500 126,620 113,000 Average realized gold price1 ($/oz)2,715 2,380 2,629 2,347 Average realized gold price1 (US$/oz)1,994 1,753 1,948 1,804 Cash costs1 ($/oz)1,451 1,540 1,579 1,500 All-in sustaining costs1 ($/oz)2,082 2,136 2,231 2,020 All-in sustaining costs1 (US$/oz)1,529 1,573 1,653 1,552 Financial Position Cash and cash equivalents41,371 33,185 41,371 33,185 Working capital(6,894) (38,044) (6,894) (38,044) Total assets618,956 619,127 618,956 619,127 Current liabilities89,115 115,591 89,115 115,591 Total liabilities191,656 220,608 191,656 220,608 Notes: Refer to the section entitled “Non-IFRS Performance Measures” for the reconciliation of these non-IFRS measurements to the financial statements Eagle River, Ontario Q4 2023Q4 2022FY 2023FY 2022 Ore milled (tonnes) Eagle River54,66958,306222,627223,734Mishi--6,15023,153Total Ore Milled54,66958,306228,777246,887 Head grade (grams per tonne, “g/t”) Eagle River14.114.012.611.5Mishi--2.33.2Total head grade14.114.012.410.7 Recoveries (%) Eagle River97.097.496.996.9Mishi--72.583.5Total Gold recovery97.097.496.796.5 Gold production (ounces) Eagle River24,07225,50287,46779,997Mishi003322,005Total Gold Production24,07225,50287,79982,002 Production sold (ounces)25,60021,65091,70079,250 Production costs per tonne milled1526515502436 Cash margin1 ($/oz)1,4621,0831,275998Cash costs1 ($/oz)1,2611,3021,3471,356All-in sustaining costs1 ($/oz)1,9022,0392,0012,003 For the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Eagle River produced 24,072 ounces and 25,502 ounces, respectively, which reflects a decrease of 6% due to a decrease in throughput at Eagle River as Mishi stockpiles were depleted and all ore was sourced from the Eagle River underground subsequent to the first quarter of 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2023, cash costs were $1,261 (US$926) per ounce of gold sold while all-in sustaining costs were $1,902 (US$1,397) per ounce of gold sold. For the full year 2023 and 2022, Eagle River produced 87,799 ounces and 82,002 respectively, which reflects increase in head grade, offset partly by lower throughput as Mishi stockpiles were depleted. The 2023 Eagle River head grade of 12.4 g/t is in the higher range of guidance due to processing additional high-grade ore from the Falcon Zone combined with positive reconciliation from the 300 Zone. During the full year 2023, AISC of $2,001 (US$1,483) per ounce of gold sold was comparable to $2,003 (US$1,539) in 2022, reflecting higher operating costs and sustaining capital expenditure offset by higher ounces sold. In 2024, Eagle River is expected to produce 80,000 to 90,000 ounces at cash costs of $1,275 to $1,425 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs of $2,050 to $2,250 (US$1,550 to US$1,700) per ounce. While production levels are in-line with the prior year, contribution of tonnes and ounces is expected to shift away from 720F Falcon Zone and towards the higher grade 300 Zone at depth.

During the fourth quarter of 2023, cash costs were $1,854 (US$1,361) per ounce of gold sold while all-in sustaining costs were $2,466 (US$1,811) per ounce. For the full year 2023 and 2022, Kiena produced 35,537 ounces and 28,848 ounces respectively, reflecting more tonnes processed, offset in part by lower grade. The 2023 Kiena head grade of 5.9 g/t is above the 2023 Kiena guidance of 3.7 – 4.7 g/t, due to an overall positive reconciliation of recovered diluted material from previous mining, and a higher proportion of ore sourced from the higher grade Kiena Deep. During the full year 2023, AISC of $2,834 (US$2,100) per ounce of gold sold was higher compared to $2,059 (US$1,582) in 2022, reflecting the inclusion of capital expenditures previously classified as Growth capital after the declaration of commercial production on December 1, 2022. Please refer to the Company’s management’s discussion & analysis dated March 12, 2024 for a detailed description of growth capital and sustaining capital. In 2024, Kiena is expected to produce 80,000 to 90,000 ounces at cash costs of $875 to $975 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs of $1,475 to $1,625 (US$1,100 to US$1,225) per ounce. Higher annual production levels reflect declining production contribution from the Martin Zone relative to higher grade ore from the Kiena Deep 129L horizon. Overall development performance subsequent to quarter end has met internal expectations, with higher grade ore expected to be processed in the second quarter. Updated Mineral Reserve and Resources for Year-End 2023 At December 31, 2023, Wesdome’s combined proven and probable mineral reserves totalled 1.1 million ounces (2.8 million tonnes grading 12.7 grams per tonne (""g/t"") gold); combined measured and indicated mineral resources (exclusive of reserves) were 327 thousand ounces (1.3 million tonnes grading 7.8 g/t gold); and combined inferred mineral resources were 808 thousand ounces (3.8 million tonnes grading 6.7 g/t gold).Cutoff grade calculations for resources reflect an increase in the gold price assumption to US$1,700 per ounce (from US$1,500 previously) and a slightly weaker Canadian dollar assumption of 1.32 (from 1.30 previously). The gold price assumption used for reserve calculations remains unchanged at US$1,400 per ounce. Changes to the mineral resources and reserves methodology included applying more conservative estimation parameters and optimized interpolation techniques at both Eagle and Kiena.Reserves and Resource estimates at both sites reflect reduced exploration spend in 2023. Drilling was therefore focused on improving geometric understanding of orebodies and conversion of resources to Measured and Indicated categories at both operations.The drilling program in 2024 has been doubled compared to 2023 to approximately $30 million, or 185,000m across underground delineation and exploration, as well as surface drilling. The program will aim to increase reserves and resources adjacent to mine infrastructure and to test conceptual targets. The Company’s gold mineral reserves effective December 31, 2023 are set out in the table below, and are compared with the gold mineral reserves for the prior corresponding period. 2023 Reserves2022 Reserves TonnesGradeOuncesTonnesGradeOunces (000)​(g/t Au)​(000)​(000)​(g/t Au)​(000)​Eagle River Proven24720.4316213914.1063Probable45215.9423261416.70331Stockpile & Inventory1711.276922.206Total71617.3840076216.33400 Kiena Proven629.5719538.4914Probable1,99511.087111,60511.47592Stockpile & Inventory46.941---Total2,06111.037311,65811.38606 Wesdome Proven30918.2518219212.5978Probable2,44711.989432,21912.93923Stockpile & Inventory2110.417922.236Total2,77812.671,1312,41212.981,007 Note: Mineral Reserves are reported above 4.01 g/t cut-off grade for Kiena Deep, 3.35g/t cut-off grade for Presqu’île and 6.58 g/t for Eagle River.

Exploration Updates Eagle River Ongoing underground drilling of the 300 East Zone has continued to confirm the continuity of the geometry and the consistency of the high-grade mineralization has now been extended to the 1,600 m-level and remains open down plunge. Recent drilling along the eastern margin of the 300 East Zone has returned wider widths, including 77.6 g/t Au over 9.4 m core length and 42.6 g/t Au over 4.9 m core length. In October 2023, the Company announced the discovery of a second zone within the volcanic rocks west of the mine diorite. This new Falcon 311 Zone has been delineated to extend at least 200 meters along plunge and nearly 100 meters along strike, and interpreted to extend 900 metres to surface, similar to the neighbouring Falcon 7 Zone. Recent drilling returned 269.6 g/t Au over 2.3 m core length (26.7 g/t Au capped,1.5 m true width), including 1,261 g/t Au over 0.5 m and 53.0 g/t Au over 2.9 m core length (28.6 g/t Au capped, 1.9 m true width). Additionally, gold mineralization was identified along the eastern margin of the mine diorite with limited drilling near the historic 6 Zone, confirming our theory that volcanic rocks along this trend are a host for gold mineralization, particularly in proximity to the diorite contact. Recent drilling returned 22.5 g/t Au over 1.7 m core length (93.5 g/t Au capped, 1.5 m true width). Both new volcanic-hosted zones have the potential to extend from surface and down plunge to depths equal to that of the neighbouring 300E Zone that has been tested to 1,500 vertical metres below surface. In 2024, the Company increased the exploration program at Eagle River and set the following objectives: Deep drilling below 300E Zone with large step-outs to provide initial indication of mineralization at depth to optimize future drilling and development, as well as convert the large Inferred Resource base at 300E Zone to the Indicated category and subsequently into Reserves.Define and extend the recently discovered Falcon 311 Zone.Test volcanic rocks east of the mine diorite having similar potential to the Falcon zones previously discovered west of the mine diorite proximal to the historic 2 Zone.Test the depth potential of zones adjacent to 300E, including 808, 811, 818, 711 and 7 East.Expand the recently drilled 6 Zone in the eastern portion of the mine diorite.Test regional targets Fork and Birch veins from surface. Year to date, warm weather conditions have deferred this drilling, which may be reallocated to exploration targets immediately east of the mine diorite. Kiena During 2023, exploration drilling was focused on converting Inferred resources to the Indicated category at Presqu’île and at Kiena Deep, and subsequently into the Reserve category. At Kiena Deep, drilling was focused on better defining and extending the South Limb and has confirmed the continuity and high grade of this zone. At Presqu’île, drilling has confirmed not only the continuity of the gold mineralization and the validity of the geologic model, but also the potential for down plunge extensions towards the east. Highlights of recent in-fill drilling include 32.5 g/t over 3.0 m core length. The development of an exploration ramp from surface to access the shallow Presqu’île Zone is underway now that the necessary permits have been secured. The Presqu’île Zone is just one of several zones having the potential to offer a supplementary source of mill feed in the upper mine area for the underutilized Kiena mill. Previous drilling results from the Shawkey and Dubuisson Zones, both adjacent to the existing 33-level track drift development that extends over three kilometres east of the Kiena mine shaft, further reinforces the potential of this area. Additionally, underground drills on the rehabilitated portion of the 33 level continued to test historic zones and anomalous drill results further to the east along strike from the Kiena mine, particularly around the Martin and Wish Zones. Rehabilitation work is progressing eastwards. In 2024, the Company increased the exploration program at Kiena and set the following objectives: Follow up on prospective areas proximal to Martin, Wish and Shawkey zones from the 33-level track drift where recent drilling results have intersected shearing and quartz veining with visible gold.Define and extend Kiena Deep Footwall and Hanging Wall Zones. Both zones have previously returned high grade results and require further definition and expansion. The amount of drilling in this area will increase gradually over the medium term as more optimal drill platforms become available.Drill test the depth potential of the Presqu’île Zone from surface.Convert existing Inferred resources at Dubuisson zone into the Indicated category. Additional structural information will be collected to improve the 3D model.

Non-IFRS Performance Measures Certain non-IFRS financial measures, ratios and supplementary measures are included in this news release, including cash margin, EBITDA, adjusted attributable net loss, adjusted attributable net loss per share, free cash flow, free cash flow per share, cash costs per ounce, average realized gold price, average realized gold price per share, all-in sustaining costs and all-in sustaining costs per ounce, and production costs per tonne milled as well as working capital. Please see the Company’s management’s discussion and analysis for the fiscal year end 2023 (the “Fiscal 2023 MD&A”) for explanations, definitions and discussion of these non-IFRS financial measures and ratios. The Company believes that these measures, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), provide investors an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. The non-IFRS and other financial measures and ratios are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures or ratios of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These measures and ratios do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers. Certain additional disclosures and reconciliations for these and other financial measures and ratios can be found below and in the section 'Non-IFRS Performance Measures' in the Company’s Fiscal 2023 MD&A available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.com and on the Company's website under the 'Investors' section. Cautionary Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures Average realized price per ounce of gold soldAverage realized price per ounce of gold sold is a non-IFRS measure and does not constitute a measure recognized by IFRS and does not have a standardized meaning defined by IFRS. Average realized price per ounce of gold sold is calculated by dividing gold sales proceeds received by the Company for the relevant period by the ounces of gold sold. It may not be comparable to information in other gold producers’ reports and filings.

The Company has included this non-IFRS performance measure throughout this document as Wesdome believes that this generally accepted industry performance measure provides a useful indication of the Company’s operational performance. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company’s performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. The following table provides a reconciliation of total cash costs per ounce of gold sold to cost of sales per the financial statements for each of the last eight quarters: In 000s, except per unit amountsQ4 2023Q4 2022FY 2023FY 2022 Cost of sales per financial statements78,506 61,997 295,422 214,371 Depletion and depreciation(23,861) (13,428) (95,188) (44,562) Silver revenue from mining operations(73) (60) (306) (263) Cash costs (a)54,572 48,509 199,928 169,546 Ounces of gold sold (b)37,620 31,500 126,620 113,000 Cash costs per ounce of gold sold (c) = (a) ÷ (b)1,451 1,540 1,579 1,500 Average 1 USD → CAD exchange rate (d)1.3619 1.3578 1.3495 1.3013 Cash costs per ounce of gold sold USD (c) ÷ (d)1,065 1,134 1,170 1,153 Production costs per tonne milledMine-site cost per tonne milled is a non-IFRS performance measure and does not constitute a measure recognized by IFRS and does not have a standardized meaning defined by IFRS, as well it may not be comparable to information in other gold producers’ reports and filings. As illustrated in the table below, this measure is calculated by adjusting cost of sales, as shown in the statements of income for non-cash depletion and depreciation, royalties and inventory level changes and then dividing by tonnes processed through the mill. Management believes that mine-site cost per tonne milled provides additional information regarding the performance of mining operations and allows Management to monitor operating costs on a more consistent basis as the per tonne milled measure reduces the cost variability associated with varying production levels. Management also uses this measure to determine the economic viability of mining blocks. As each mining block is evaluated based on the net realizable value of each tonne mined, the estimated revenue on a per tonne basis must be in excess of the production cost per tonne milled in order to be economically viable. Management is aware that this per tonne milled measure is impacted by fluctuations in throughput and thus uses this evaluation tool in conjunction with production costs prepared in accordance with IFRS. This measure supplements production cost information prepared in accordance with IFRS and allows investors to distinguish between changes in production costs resulting from changes in production versus changes in operating performance.

It is calculated as the difference between gold sales revenue from mining operations and cash mine site operating costs (see Cash cost per ounce of gold sold under this Section above) per the Company’s Financial Statements. The Company believes it illustrates the performance of the Company’s operating mines and enables investors to better understand the Company’s performance in comparison to other gold producers who present results on a similar basis.

The Company believes that this measure represents the total costs of producing gold from current operations and provides Wesdome and other stakeholders with additional information that illustrates the Company’s operational performance and ability to generate cash flow. This cost measure seeks to reflect the full cost of gold production from current operations on a per-ounce of gold sold basis. New project and growth capital are not included.

The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, the Company and certain investors use EBITDA as an indicator of Wesdome’s ability to generate liquidity by producing operating cash flow to fund working capital needs, service debt obligations and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA is intended to provide additional information to investors and analysts and do not have any standardized definition under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA excludes the impact of cash costs of financing activities and taxes, and the effects of changes in operating working capital balances, and therefore are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS.

The offering price per unit was $38.50, with underwriters exercising their option to purchase additional units. The offering was made under an effective shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The closure of Delek Logistics Partners' public offering of common units is a significant financial event that directly impacts the company's capital structure and liquidity. The successful exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional units not only demonstrates market confidence but also increases the total capital raised to approximately $132.5 million. This capital infusion is earmarked for the repayment of existing debts under the revolving credit agreement, which is a strategic move to manage the company's leverage and interest expenses.From a financial perspective, this transaction could improve Delek Logistics' debt-to-equity ratio, a key metric that investors use to gauge a company's financial health. By paying down debt, Delek Logistics may potentially lower its risk profile and improve its creditworthiness. However, it is essential to consider the dilutive effect of issuing additional equity on existing shareholders, which could impact earnings per share and, consequently, investor returns in the short term.

About IMUNON IMUNON is a fully integrated, clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on advancing a portfolio of innovative treatments that harness the body’s natural mechanisms to generate safe, effective and durable responses across a broad array of human diseases, constituting a differentiating approach from conventional therapies. IMUNON is developing its non-viral DNA technology across four modalities. The first modality, TheraPlas®, is developed for the coding of proteins and cytokines in the treatment of solid tumors where an immunological approach is deemed promising. The second modality, PlaCCine®, is developed for the coding of viral antigens that can elicit a strong immunological response. This technology may represent a promising platform for the development of vaccines in infectious diseases. The third modality, FixPlas®, concerns the application of our DNA technology to produce universal cancer vaccines, also called tumor associated antigen cancer vaccines. The fourth modality, IndiPlas®, is in the discovery phase and will focus on the development of personalized cancer vaccines, or neoepitope cancer vaccines. The Company’s lead clinical program, IMNN-001, is a DNA-based immunotherapy for the localized treatment of newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer currently in Phase 2 development. IMNN-001 works by instructing the body to produce safe and durable levels of powerful cancer-fighting molecules, such as interleukin-12 and interferon gamma, at the tumor site. Additionally, the Company is conducting IND-enabling preclinical studies for the development of a COVID-19 booster vaccine (IMNN-101) and a treatment for the LASSA virus (IMNN-102). The Company has also initiated preclinical work to develop a Trp2 tumor associated antigen cancer vaccine in melanoma (IMNN-201). We will continue to leverage these modalities and to advance the technological frontier of plasmid DNA to better serve patients with difficult-to-treat conditions.

The partnership used part of the proceeds to redeem existing notes and plans to use the rest for further redemptions, aiming to lower interest expenses and enhance flexibility for deleveraging. Positive The partnership successfully closed a private placement transaction for $200 million in new 9.25% senior secured first lien notes due 2029. Proceeds from the placement were used to redeem all outstanding 9.25% senior secured first lien notes due 2024 and will be used to redeem $50 million of outstanding 11.00% senior notes due 2025. The move aims to extend near-term maturities, reduce total interest expenses, and increase financial flexibility for the partnership's deleveraging strategy. Negative None. Financial Analyst The issuance of a new series of 9.25% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2029 by Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P. and its subsidiary is a strategic financial move aimed at restructuring the company's debt profile. By retiring the existing 2024 notes and calling $50 million of the 2025 notes, the company is effectively extending the maturity of its debt, which can alleviate short-term liquidity pressures and provide more leeway in managing cash flows. The interest rate of the new notes being equal to that of the retired notes indicates a neutral stance on the cost of borrowing, which is beneficial given the current interest rate environment.Investors should note that the transaction could signal management's confidence in the company's future cash flows, as the ability to secure financing at the same interest rate despite extending the maturity suggests investor trust in the company's creditworthiness. However, it is also essential to monitor the total leverage ratio post-transaction, as excessive debt can lead to increased financial risk. The company's deleveraging strategy mentioned by the CEO is a positive sign for long-term financial stability, but the effectiveness of this strategy should be evaluated in subsequent financial statements and debt metrics. Debt Market Analyst The refinancing activity undertaken by Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P. reflects a proactive approach to capital management, particularly within the context of the debt markets. The move to retire higher-cost debt ahead of maturity could be seen as an opportunistic play to take advantage of prevailing market conditions, possibly indicating a forecast of tighter credit conditions or rising interest rates in the near future. The choice of a private placement for the issuance might suggest a targeted approach to debt funding, potentially securing more favorable terms or a quicker execution than a public offering.Market participants should consider the implications of such refinancing on the company's credit spreads and the secondary market performance of its bonds. The redemption of the 11.00% Senior Notes due 2025 at a time when the company is issuing new notes at a lower interest rate of 9.25% could indicate management's confidence in reducing the cost of capital over time. This could be a positive signal to bondholders and credit rating agencies, potentially leading to an improved credit profile for the company. Corporate Strategy Expert Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P.'s announcement to retire and call a portion of its existing debt obligations can be viewed within the broader scope of corporate finance strategy. The decision to extend the maturity of its debt is indicative of the company's strategic planning to manage its debt obligations without compromising operational flexibility. This is particularly relevant for stakeholders who are monitoring the company's long-term strategic goals, including its deleveraging strategy.From a corporate strategy standpoint, the move may be interpreted as a signal that the company is prioritizing financial health and is taking active steps to ensure it remains well-positioned to meet its long-term obligations. This could be reassuring for investors who are concerned about the company's ability to navigate potential economic downturns or industry-specific challenges. The management's commentary on reducing total interest expense and adding flexibility should be weighed against the company's operational performance and growth prospects to assess the overall impact of the debt restructuring on shareholder value. 03/12/2024 - 04:58 PM Partnership Retires Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2024Calls $50 million of Senior Notes due 2025INDIANAPOLIS, March 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P.

(NYSE American: SCPX) closes public offering of 10,000,000 shares of common stock, generating $1,500,000 in gross proceeds. The funds will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. ThinkEquity served as the book-running manager for the offering. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Scorpius Holdings, Inc.'s recent public offering is a strategic move to bolster its working capital, which is essential for maintaining operations and funding growth initiatives. The relatively low offering price of $0.15 per share suggests either a strategic pricing decision aimed at ensuring the sale of all shares or a reflection of the current market valuation of the company. The gross proceeds of $1,500,000, while not substantial for a large corporation, could be significant for a smaller CDMO, depending on its financial health and operational scale.The decision to go through with a public offering can have several implications. On one hand, it dilutes existing shareholders' equity, potentially leading to a negative market reaction if investors perceive this as a sign of financial distress or if the dilution is not offset by future growth. On the other hand, if the capital is used effectively to improve the company's financial position or to invest in profitable projects, it could lead to long-term shareholder value creation.An important aspect to consider is the role of ThinkEquity as the sole book-running manager. Their reputation and the success of the offering could influence investor confidence. The fact that the offering was made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement indicates a level of preparedness and regulatory compliance that is crucial for investor trust. Market Research Analyst Examining the broader CDMO market, one can contextualize the significance of Scorpius Holdings' stock offering. The CDMO industry is highly competitive, with companies constantly seeking ways to scale operations, invest in technology and expand their service offerings. The funds raised could enable Scorpius to enhance its competitive position by investing in these areas. However, the success of such investments depends on the company's strategic vision and operational execution.Moreover, the pricing of the stock offering at $0.15 per share is an indicator of market sentiment and valuation of Scorpius relative to its peers. Investors and analysts will likely compare this valuation with industry benchmarks to assess the attractiveness of the offering. It is also essential to monitor the post-offering performance of the stock to gauge the market's response to the dilution and the company's use of the proceeds.In the CDMO industry, where contract stability and client relationships are key, the additional capital might be leveraged to secure new contracts or invest in quality systems that can attract larger clients, potentially leading to increased market share and revenue streams. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the offering's adherence to SEC regulations, including the use of an effective shelf registration statement and the provision of a final prospectus, is critical. These measures ensure transparency and legal compliance, which are fundamental in maintaining investor confidence. The legal language indicating that the offering does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy in any jurisdiction where it would be unlawful, is a standard disclaimer to prevent regulatory issues and to inform investors of the offering's legal boundaries.Furthermore, the involvement of ThinkEquity's Prospectus Department underscores the importance of thorough documentation and disclosure in public offerings. The prospectus provides detailed information about the offering, the company's financial status and risk factors, which are essential for investors making informed decisions. The legal framework surrounding public offerings is designed to balance the company's capital-raising efforts with the protection of investors and the integrity of the market. 03/12/2024 - 05:00 PM DURHAM, N.C., March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Scorpius Holdings, Inc.

(IVT) declared a first quarter 2024 cash distribution of $0.226 per share, a 5% year-over-year increase, amounting to an annualized rate of $0.905 per share. Positive The announcement of a 5% year-over-year increase in cash distribution showcases InvenTrust's commitment to rewarding shareholders. The annualized rate of $0.905 per share indicates a stable and potentially lucrative investment opportunity for investors. The Board of Directors' decision reflects confidence in the company's financial position and growth prospects. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of InvenTrust Properties Corp.'s increased cash distribution is a positive signal to shareholders, reflecting a robust financial position and a commitment to returning value. A 5% year-over-year increase in distributions is notably above the average inflation rate, indicating that the company is not only maintaining but also increasing real shareholder value. This move could potentially attract income-focused investors and bolster the stock's appeal in a market where yield is highly sought after. It is imperative to analyze the company's payout ratio and earnings to ensure that the increased distribution is sustainable without compromising future growth opportunities or financial stability. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, InvenTrust Properties Corp.'s decision to raise its cash distribution could be reflective of its competitive positioning within the real estate sector. Increased distributions can often be an indicator of strong operational performance and effective asset management, especially in the retail real estate market where InvenTrust operates. Investors should consider the company's occupancy rates, lease agreements and the overall health of the retail sector as these factors are critical in assessing the long-term viability of the increased cash distribution. It's also worth noting how this increase aligns with industry trends, as it may set expectations for peer companies. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Analyst As a REIT, InvenTrust Properties is required to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders and the increased distribution suggests that the company is generating ample income. This is a key consideration for REIT investors, as distributions are a major component of total returns in this asset class. The annualized rate of $0.905 per share will need to be evaluated against the company's funds from operations (FFO), a common REIT performance metric, to gauge if the increased distribution is backed by operational cash flows or if it's a strategic decision to distribute reserves. Understanding the underlying financial health, such as the FFO-to-distribution ratio, is crucial for stakeholders. 03/12/2024 - 05:26 PM DOWNERS GROVE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- InvenTrust Properties Corp. (NYSE: IVT) announced today that its Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2024 cash distribution of $0.226 per share of common stock, which represents a 5% year-over-year increase.

The Company does not provide a reconciliation of such forward-looking measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP because to do so would be potentially misleading and not practical given the difficulty of projecting event-driven transactional and other non-core operating items in any future period.

Forward Looking Statements Certain statements contained in this press release constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intends,” “outlook,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “would,” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements about future events and financial results that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties. In particular, these include but are not limited to statements relating to the Company’s business strategy, future offerings and programs and expected financial performance for the first quarter of 2024 and the year ending December 31, 2024. Many factors could cause actual future events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this press release, including but not limited to the fact that we have a relatively short operating history in a rapidly evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful; that if we do not successfully develop and deploy new software, platform features or services to address the needs of our clients, if we fail to retain our existing clients or acquire new clients, and/or if we fail to expand effectively into new markets, our revenue may decrease and our business may be harmed; and the other risks and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors” of the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on November 13, 2023 and August 10, 2023, respectively and the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on March 28, 2023, as well as the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K that will be filed following this earnings release, and other periodic reports filed by the Company from time to time with the SEC. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties (some of which are beyond the control of Springbig), and other assumptions, which may cause the actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and the Company assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements other than as required by applicable law. The Company does not give any assurance that it will achieve its expectations. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) included throughout this press release, we have disclosed EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures that we calculate as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, in the case of EBITDA, and further adjustments to exclude unusual and/or infrequent costs, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, which are detailed in the reconciliation table that follows, in order to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results. Below we have provided a reconciliation of net loss (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because these metrics are key measures used by our management to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of investment capacity. Accordingly, we believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management. Management also believes that these measures provide improved comparability between fiscal periods. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows: Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; andEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us. Because of these limitations, you should consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net income and our other GAAP results. Also, these non-GAAP financial measures, as determined and presented by the Company, may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

(NYSE: CPA) reported a 17.0% increase in capacity and a 17.5% increase in passenger traffic for February 2024 compared to 2023. The load factor also improved by 0.3 percentage points. Copa Holdings is a prominent Latin American airline serving various regions. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in Copa Holdings' capacity (ASM) and passenger traffic (RPM) by 17.0% and 17.5% respectively, compared to the previous year, indicates a robust growth in demand for the airline's services. This growth is noteworthy in the context of the airline industry, which is often volatile and affected by external factors like economic conditions, fuel prices and geopolitical events. The load factor improvement, albeit marginal, suggests that Copa Holdings is not just adding capacity, but is also effectively filling its seats, a key indicator of operational efficiency and profitability.For investors and stakeholders, these metrics are essential as they can influence the company's revenue and earnings. The positive trend in traffic statistics could signal a healthy financial outlook, potentially impacting the company's stock performance. It's important to monitor whether this growth is sustainable and if it translates into improved financial results in the subsequent earnings reports. Financial Analyst The increase in ASM and RPM for Copa Holdings has direct implications for revenue, as more filled seats typically translate to higher income. However, investors should also consider the cost side of the equation. The expansion of capacity often comes with increased expenses, such as fuel, maintenance and labor costs. The profitability of the added capacity will depend on the company's ability to manage these costs effectively.Furthermore, the airline industry is capital-intensive, so assessing the financing of Copa Holdings' fleet expansion is crucial. The source of financing, whether through debt or equity, can affect the company's balance sheet and financial ratios. An increase in leverage, for instance, could raise concerns about financial risk, particularly if the industry faces a downturn. Economist The data provided by Copa Holdings serves as an economic indicator, reflecting broader trends in travel demand within Latin America. The reported growth could suggest economic expansion in the regions served by the airline, as increased travel often correlates with economic activity. Additionally, the airline's performance can be a bellwether for tourism and business travel health, sectors that contribute significantly to many Latin American economies.However, it is essential to contextualize this growth within the broader economic environment. Factors such as currency fluctuations, inflation and regional economic policies can affect the sustainability of demand. Investors should consider these macroeconomic factors when evaluating the long-term prospects of Copa Holdings. 03/12/2024 - 05:16 PM PANAMA CITY, March 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Copa Holdings, S.A.

Cash and restricted cash of $54.2 million as of December 31, 2023. Forecasted Capex for full year 2024 to be $55-60 million with Red River Phase 1 capex expected to be $45-50 million. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 20% YoY increase in Q4 revenues for Arq, Inc.'s Powder Activated Carbon (PAC) business, paired with a gross margin improvement to 50%, signals robust performance in a competitive market. This substantial margin growth, particularly in a manufacturing sector, is indicative of successful cost management and a strategic shift towards profitability. The Adjusted EBITDA of $7.2 million and Net Income of $3.3 million represent a turnaround from previous quarters, which is a positive indicator for investors looking at the company's operational efficiency and profitability.Arq's Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) expansion plans, with commissioning expected by Q4 2024, could further cement the company's market position within the environmental technology sector. The focus on high-performance, environmentally responsible products aligns with global regulatory trends, such as the EPA's PFAS regulations and could drive future demand. However, the increased capital expenditure forecast for 2024, primarily due to construction and equipment costs, may raise concerns about project execution and cost overruns. Investors should weigh the potential for long-term value creation against the risks associated with these capital investments. Market Research Analyst The activated carbon market is witnessing growth driven by increased regulatory focus on environmental standards, particularly in water purification. Arq's strategic pivot to capitalize on this trend, as evidenced by their rebranding and expansion into the GAC market, positions the company to potentially capture a larger market share. The supply agreement with LSR Materials to serve the European market indicates Arq's intention to expand its global footprint and diversify its customer base, which could mitigate regional market volatility.The company's ability to secure sales contracts for its GAC products well in advance of production is a testament to the strong market demand and could provide a steady revenue stream upon commissioning. However, the increased costs for the Red River expansion project raise questions about the company's forecasting accuracy and project management capabilities. Investors should monitor the company's ability to maintain cost discipline while executing on its strategic growth initiatives. Environmental Technology Expert Arq's focus on environmental technology, particularly in the activated carbon space for purification applications, is timely given the heightened global attention on sustainability and environmental remediation. Their emphasis on higher margin PAC products and the development of GAC facilities suggests a strategic alignment with industry trends towards more sustainable and efficient materials.The company's engagement with PFAS ('Forever Chemicals') treatment, which is an area of increasing regulatory scrutiny, particularly in Europe and North America, could offer significant growth opportunities. The planned commissioning of the Red River facility for GAC production is poised to meet the rising demand for such purification solutions. However, the increased cost of the facility's expansion warrants close monitoring to ensure that the long-term benefits justify the short-term financial impacts. 03/12/2024 - 05:05 PM Q4 2023 revenues from foundational Powder Activated Carbon business increase 20% YoY while gross margin improves to 50%, generating Adjusted EBITDA of $7.2 million and Net Income of $3.3 million, while Granular Activated Carbon growth business remains on schedule for commissioning by Q4 2024 GREENWOOD VILLAGE, Colo., March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Arq, Inc. (NASDAQ: ARQ) (the ""Company"" or ""Arq""), a producer of activated carbon and other environmentally efficient carbon products for use in purification and sustainable materials, today announced its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Financial Highlights Achieved positive net income of $3.3 million in Q4 2023, reflecting the first positive net income quarter since Q4 2021.Increased revenue to $28.1 million in Q4 2023, reflecting growth of 20% over the prior year period, driven by higher average selling prices, positive changes in product mix and $4.7 million of take-or-pay revenue, partially offset by natural gas pricing impacts to volume.Improved gross margin to 50% in Q4 2023, due to higher revenue, as well as continued focus on profitability over volume, cost management, and take-or-pay revenue.Achieved Q4 2023 Adjusted EBITDA of $7.2 million, reflecting the second consecutive quarter of positive Adjusted EBITDA (Q3 2023 Adjusted EBITDA of $0.9 million)(1).Exited 2023 with cash and restricted cash of $54.2 million.Capex for full year 2024 forecasted to be $55-60 million with Red River Phase 1 capex expected to be $45-50 million.

(1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the paragraph titled “Non-GAAP Measures” for the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures. Recent Business Highlights Completed corporate rebrand and commenced trading under the new Nasdaq ticker ""ARQ"", reflecting strategic expansion and evolution to a leading North American environmental technology company.Further optimized Powder Activated Carbon (""PAC"") portfolio by prioritizing profitability over volume, managing costs, improving product mix, and eliminating unfavorable contracts. Achieved positive PAC portfolio cash flow in Q4 2023.Continued development of the Corbin facility to optimize for GAC feedstock at Red River; remains on time and within budget, with commissioning activities beginning imminently and expected to conclude in Q2 2024Continued strategic expansion of Red River Granular Activated Carbon (""GAC"") facility; construction commenced in October 2023 and commissioning targeted for Q4 2024.Entered into a framework for a definitive supply agreement with LSR Materials to serve the growing European water purification and filtration market, focusing on PFAS (""Forever Chemicals"") and micropollutants in wastewater. ""We capped off 2023 with strong momentum and are very pleased with the steps we have taken and continue to take to further improve our foundational PAC business,"" said Robert Rasmus, CEO of Arq. ""We delivered fourth quarter results that clearly evidence the improving profitability of our existing business. We grew revenue by 20%, nearly doubled our gross margins to 50%, generated positive cash flow from our PAC business, and achieved positive net income for the first time in 8 quarters. We recently marked the one-year anniversary of our Arq acquisition by completing a corporate rebrand that reflects our transformation to a leading environmental technology company."" Rasmus continued, ""We continue to make good progress in executing our high-return strategic growth projects focused on the robust and growing GAC market. The primary focus is completing the optimization at our Corbin facility to produce cost-effective feedstock for Red River in Q2 2024, and commissioning our 25 million pounds per year GAC expansion at our Red River facility in Q4 2024. We are encouraged by our ongoing conversations with potential GAC customers, and continue to see strong demand for our high-performance environmentally responsible granular products, with sales contracts expected well in advance of first production. The global GAC market remains robust, driven by a variety of factors including continued focus on remediation, and further evidenced by EPA's recent update regarding its targeted PFAS regulations."" Rasmus added, ""While the timing to complete our Red River Phase 1 facility expansion remains on track, the cost to complete the expansion has increased versus our original forecast. The increase was driven by higher construction costs, increased equipment costs and engineering fees, completion schedule acceleration, and inaccurate estimate inputs provided by third party consultants. Despite this increase, we remain in a position to fund the project from cash on hand, cash generation, ongoing cost reduction initiatives, potential customer prepayments for GAC contracts, and a planned refinancing and potential expansion of our term loan - and importantly, we have no plans to issue equity. Despite the cost increases, the project's investment economics remain attractive, as we expect we will achieve investment payback in 3 years or less, while generating long-term stakeholder value."" Fourth Quarter 2023 Results Revenues totaled $28.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, reflecting an increase of 20% compared to $23.4 million in the prior year period.

Other operating expenses totaled $10.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $9.3 million in the prior year period.

The improvement was mainly driven by improved gross margin due to the aforementioned factors.

Adjusted EBITDA was $7.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to Adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.2 million in the prior year period. The improvement was driven by continued focus on profitability over volume, cost management, positive changes in product mix, and take-or-pay revenue.

Cash as of December 31, 2023, including $8.8 million of restricted cash, totaled $54.2 million, compared to $76.4 million as of the prior year period. The reduction in cash on hand was primarily driven by ongoing capital expenditures associated with the strategic expansion of Red River and Corbin facilities. Total debt, inclusive of financing leases, as of December 31, 2023, totaled $20.9 million compared to $4.6 million as of the prior year period. The increase was driven by the $10.0 million term loan entered into in conjunction with the legacy Arq acquisition completed in February 2023 as well as the assumption of legacy Arq's loan. Red River Update & 2024 Capex Forecast Capital expenditures for full year 2024 are expected to total $55-60 million with Red River Phase 1 capital expenditures expected to be $45-50 million. The latest capital expenditures forecast for Red River Phase 1 reflects a midpoint increase of approximately 36% versus the Company's previous forecast provided in January 2024. Of this increase, approximately 45% is due to more accurately accounting for inflation in construction costs, and the impact of shifting to a 6-day accelerated workweek. Approximately 45% is due to increased equipment costs, associated with design changes that will drive greater efficiency and volumes, and correcting for inaccurate estimate inputs previously provided by third party consultants. The remaining approximately 10% is due to various items including engineering fees. Despite the increase for the Red River expansion, Arq management believes project economics remain attractive, with an expected investment payback of 3 years or less. Construction of the Red River GAC facility began in October 2023, and commissioning is expected by the fourth quarter of 2024. Capital expenditures for full year 2024 are expected to be funded with cash on hand, cash generation, ongoing cost reduction initiatives, potential customer prepayments for GAC contracts, and a planned refinancing and potential expansion of our term loan. Full Year 2023 Results Revenues totaled $99.2 million for full year 2023, compared to $103.0 million in the prior year. The revenue decline was primarily driven by lower sales of products due to lower natural gas prices which negatively impacted power generation customers, partially offset by higher average selling prices, positive changes in product mix, and take-or-pay revenue. Cost of revenues totaled $67.3 million for full year 2023, compared to $80.5 million in the prior year. Gross margin was 32.1% for full year 2023, compared to 21.9% in the prior year. The increase was driven by higher average selling prices, positive changes in product mix, and take-or-pay revenue, partially offset by lower volumes. Other operating expenses were $45.2 million for full year 2023, compared to $34.6 million in the prior year. The increase was mainly driven by higher payroll and benefits expense, combined with higher G&A expenses associated with the acquisition of substantially all of the subsidiaries of Arq Limited. Operating loss totaled $13.3 million for full year 2023, compared to an operating loss of $12.1 million in the prior year. The decline was mainly driven by lower revenues resulting from the aforementioned factors, along with higher operating expenses. Interest expense was $3.0 million for full year 2023, compared to $0.3 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by incremental interest expense on the Company’s $10.0 million term loan entered into in conjunction with the legacy Arq acquisition completed in February 2023. Income tax expenses were $0.2 million for full year 2023, compared to $0.2 million in the prior year. Net loss was $12.2 million, or $0.42 per diluted share for full year 2023, compared to net loss of $8.9 million, or $0.48 per diluted share in the prior year. The decline was driven by lower revenue and higher operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $2.6 million for full year 2023, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 million in the prior year. The decline was mainly driven by higher operating costs, which included $4.9 million of one-time transaction and integration costs related to the legacy Arq acquisition, as well as $1.7 million of severance expense for three former executives. See note below regarding the use of the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.

accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA reduced by the non-cash impact of equity earnings from equity method investments and gain on sale of the Marshall Mine, increased by cash distributions from equity method investments, loss on early settlement of a long-term receivable and loss on change in estimate, asset retirement obligations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net income in accordance with GAAP as a measure of performance. See below for a reconciliation from Net income, the nearest GAAP financial measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. The Company believes that the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measures are less susceptible to variances that affect the Company's operating performance. The Company includes these non-GAAP measures because management uses them in the evaluation of the Company's operating performance and believes they help to facilitate comparison of operating results between periods. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and users of the financial statements by excluding certain expenses, gains, and losses which can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry and may not be indicative of core operating results and business outlook.

Vallourec, a global leader in premium tubular solutions for energy markets, reported EBITDA of €1.2 billion in 2023. ArcelorMittal aims to increase exposure to downstream tubular market and energy transition business. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of a 28.4% equity interest in Vallourec by ArcelorMittal for €955 million is a significant investment, indicating a strategic move to strengthen its position in the tubular market. The transaction value, at €14.64 per share, suggests a premium on Vallourec's current market valuation, hinting at ArcelorMittal's confidence in Vallourec's growth trajectory and the synergies expected from this deal. Considering Vallourec's reported EBITDA of €1.2 billion on sales of €5.1 billion, the acquisition price seems justified, especially with the anticipated growth in the energy transition sector.Investors should note that the deal is contingent on regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the latter half of the year. This timeline introduces a degree of uncertainty, as delays or rejections from regulatory bodies could impact the finalization of the deal. Moreover, ArcelorMittal's decision not to launch a tender offer for the remaining shares in the next six months allows them to avoid a full buyout while still gaining significant influence over Vallourec's operations and strategic direction. Market Research Analyst Vallourec's focus on low-carbon, integrated production hubs in the US and Brazil, which are key strategic markets for ArcelorMittal, represents a competitive advantage in the current global push for sustainability in steel production. The company's low carbon emissions in its steel-making facilities and its ambitious CO2 intensity reduction roadmap align with increasing regulatory and consumer demands for environmentally responsible practices. This acquisition could therefore enhance ArcelorMittal's environmental credentials and appeal to ESG-focused investors.Additionally, Vallourec's positioning in the premium tubular solutions market, especially for sectors like energy, automotive and construction, is likely to benefit from the ongoing energy transition. With the company expecting a significant EBITDA contribution from this segment by 2030, this move by ArcelorMittal is well-timed to capitalize on the demand for infrastructure essential for hydrogen, geothermal and carbon capture technologies. Energy Sector Analyst The strategic acquisition highlights ArcelorMittal's commitment to playing a central role in the energy transition, with Vallourec's products being crucial for hydrogen, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and geothermal applications. The demand for such applications is expected to grow, positioning the company to benefit from the burgeoning market for energy transition technologies. Vallourec's comparatively low carbon footprint, coupled with ambitious improvement targets, supports a narrative of sustainable growth in a sector that is increasingly sensitive to carbon emissions.It is also worth noting the potential for Vallourec to capture a larger share of the energy market as global efforts to transition away from fossil fuels intensify. The expected increase in EBITDA from the energy transition business to 10-15% by 2030 offers a glimpse into the strategic importance of this acquisition for ArcelorMittal, as it diversifies its portfolio in anticipation of future market shifts. 03/12/2024 - 05:00 PM 12 March 2024, 22:00 CET ArcelorMittal (the ‘Company’) today announces that it has signed a Share Purchase Agreement to acquire 65,243,206 shares, representing c.28.4% equity interest in Vallourec, for €14.64 per share from Funds managed by Apollo Global Management, Inc., for a total consideration of approximately €955 million. Transaction closing is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the second half of the year. Having carried out a successful restructuring in recent years, Vallourec presents a compelling opportunity to increase ArcelorMittal’s exposure to the attractive, downstream, value-added tubular market. It is a global leader in premium tubular solutions for energy markets and demanding industrial applications, offering innovative, safe and competitive products for sectors including energy, automotive and construction. 85% of Vallourec’s 2.2 million tonnes of annual rolling capacity is focused around low-carbon, integrated productions hubs in US and Brazil, both of which are important strategic markets for ArcelorMittal. In 2023 Vallourec reported EBITDA of €1.2 billion on sales of €5.1 billion. It expects EBITDA from the energy transition business to reach between 10 and 15% by 2030, given the growth potential from hydrogen, geothermal and carbon capture. ArcelorMittal does not intend to launch a tender offer for Vallourec’s remaining shares over the next six months. Commenting, Aditya Mittal, CEO, ArcelorMittal, said: “Vallourec is a quality, high added-value tubular business, with established positions of strength in the attractive Brazilian and US markets.

Chairman Moishe Gubin praised the successful strategic plan, improved asset quality, well-managed capital ratios, and enhanced financial performance. Strong community support and customer loyalty highlighted. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 56% increase in net earnings for OptimumBank Holdings, Inc. is a significant highlight, reflecting a robust year-over-year growth. This performance is particularly noteworthy given the broader banking sector's challenges, such as low-interest rate environments and the competitive landscape. The growth in net earnings could be attributed to several factors, including effective cost management, growth in core banking activities, or possibly favorable loan loss provisions.Moreover, the 41% increase in the loan portfolio suggests aggressive lending strategies that have paid off. However, this should be juxtaposed with the quality of these loans. An increase in loan provisions could indicate potential future risks if these loans do not perform as expected. The capital to total assets ratio at 10.00% reflects a strong capital position, which is crucial for investor confidence, especially in a sector where capital adequacy is closely monitored. Market Research Analyst The issuance of 72,221 shares in a private placement indicates the company's strategy to raise capital without diluting existing shareholders excessively. It's a move that suggests management is balancing growth with shareholder value. The company's focus on maximizing shareholder value, as stated by Chairman Moishe Gubin, aligns with investors' interests and could positively influence the stock's attractiveness.Furthermore, the Bank's focus on community outreach and securing loyal business customers in South Florida demonstrates a commitment to solidifying its market presence. The increase in secured and unsecured lending limits also points to the bank's confidence in its risk management processes and its ability to cater to larger business needs, which might attract investors looking for companies with a clear growth trajectory. Economist The performance of OptimumBank Holdings, Inc. provides insights into the broader economic environment. Strong asset growth and increased lending capacity suggest a healthy demand for loans, which is often a sign of economic expansion in the region they serve. However, one must consider the macroeconomic conditions that could affect future performance, such as interest rate changes, regulatory shifts, or economic downturns, which could impact the bank's ability to maintain such growth rates and manage loan defaults effectively.It is also essential to consider the potential impact of inflation on the bank's net interest margins. While the bank appears to be well-capitalized, inflationary pressures could squeeze margins if the rates on deposits rise faster than the rates on loans. 03/12/2024 - 04:55 PM Fort Lauderdale, FL, March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OptimumBank Holdings, Inc., (NASDAQ: OPHC) The Company had net earnings of $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to net earnings of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 an increase of 56%; and with $70 million of Stockholders’ equity.

Provides Settlement Notice Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. announces preliminary approval of a settlement in a civil action regarding 'short-swing' profits under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, potentially recovering $3,300,000 from Antara Defendants. Positive AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. has received preliminary approval for a proposed settlement in a civil action regarding 'short-swing' profits under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The settlement involves recovering alleged profits realized by the Antara Defendants in connection with their purchases and sales of AMC securities. Plaintiffs Dennis J. Donoghue and Mark Rubenstein, both AMC shareholders, brought the civil action for the benefit of AMC. A federal court in New York has scheduled a hearing on May 2, 2024, to consider final approval of the proposed settlement. If finally approved, AMC stands to receive $3,300,000 from the Antara Defendants, who will then be released from claims of violations of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.

Legal Expert The preliminary approval of a settlement concerning alleged 'short-swing' profits under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by a federal court represents a significant legal development for AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. This statute is intended to prevent corporate insiders from profiting on information not available to the public by buying and selling their company's stock within a six-month period. The settlement, if finalized, would result in a payment of $3.3 million to AMC from the Antara Defendants, which could positively affect AMC's financial position. It also demonstrates the company's commitment to upholding shareholder interests and the enforcement of securities laws, which could potentially enhance investor confidence. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the $3.3 million settlement in AMC's favor may not represent a substantial sum relative to the company's overall market capitalization. However, it is crucial to consider the potential implications for AMC's stock price. The news of a settlement can be perceived positively by the market as it removes legal uncertainty and potential liabilities. Additionally, it may be indicative of a proactive stance by the company's management in safeguarding shareholder value. Investors and analysts will be monitoring the final approval of the settlement and any subsequent financial impact on AMC's quarterly results. Market Research Analyst The broader market impact of this legal settlement for AMC is nuanced. While the direct financial benefit is clear, the settlement also signals to the market that AMC is an active participant in monitoring and addressing corporate governance issues. This can have a ripple effect in the industry, prompting other companies to scrutinize similar transactions more closely. Over the long term, this could contribute to a more transparent market environment, potentially affecting investor sentiment and the valuation of companies within the sector. 03/12/2024 - 04:30 PM LEAWOOD, Kan.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.

The company aims to streamline operations, reduce debt through asset sales, and focus on high-quality wine products. Despite a decline in net revenue and increased interest expense, VWE is actively working on restructuring and transformation plans to enhance profitability. The company has been granted an additional 180-day extension to regain compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement. Positive Generated $11.9 million in cash from operations in the quarter Focus on streamlining operations and reducing debt through asset sales Reported decline in net revenue and increased interest expense Active efforts towards restructuring and transformation for enhanced profitability Granted additional 180-day extension to regain compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement Negative Net revenue decreased by $10.4 million across all business segments Loss from operations in the quarter was $40.7 million Increased interest expense of $6.1 million Net loss attributable to VWE common stockholders was $49.4 million Second quarter fiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA was $(28.8) million Financial Analyst Examining the financial results of Vintage Wine Estates, the reported net loss attributable to VWE common stockholders of $49.4 million is a significant figure that warrants investor attention. Despite this loss, the company's ability to generate $11.9 million in cash from operations indicates a degree of operational efficiency in managing working capital and inventory. This cash generation could be seen as a positive signal in the short-term, suggesting that the company is taking steps to stabilize its financial position.However, the increase in interest expense due to higher interest rates could pose a long-term challenge, as it may affect the company's cost of debt and ultimately its net earnings. Additionally, the adjusted EBITDA being negative at $(28.8) million is concerning, as it reflects the company's operating performance without the impact of non-cash expenses and is a commonly used metric to assess a company's profitability and financial health. Market Research Analyst The strategic shift towards an omnichannel business model and the focus on a core portfolio of Super Premium+ products suggest that Vintage Wine Estates is attempting to adapt to changing market conditions and consumer preferences. The move to streamline operations and sell non-core assets is aimed at reducing costs and debt, which could potentially improve the company's competitive advantage in the long-term. The impact of these changes on the company's market position will depend on the successful execution of the turnaround plan and the ability to leverage its market access effectively.It is also crucial to monitor the end market demand, as a softer demand can have a ripple effect on the company's sales and growth prospects. With the company's stock trading below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement, investor confidence could be influenced by the company's ability to meet the compliance deadline, which now has an extended timeframe until September 2024. Debt Restructuring Analyst The forbearance agreement with lenders is a critical development, granting the company time to restructure its operations and address its debt obligations. The flexibility provided by the forbearance agreement is a temporary relief, but it underscores the urgent need for the company to amend its credit agreement and meet the terms of the forbearance to avoid acceleration of debt maturity. Investors should be aware of the risks associated with the company's current debt level of $305.6 million and the possibility of not having sufficient cash to repay the debt if the forbearance terms are not met.The disclosure that approximately 40% of debt is hedged at a blended rate of 2.3% until 2025 provides some predictability regarding interest payments, which is a positive aspect in terms of financial planning. Nonetheless, the overall debt situation remains a critical factor in assessing the company's long-term financial stability and investor risk. 03/12/2024 - 04:26 PM Generated $11.9 million in cash from operations in the quarter Granted additional time to regain compliance with Nasdaq minimum bid price listing requirement SANTA ROSA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Vintage Wine Estates, Inc. (Nasdaq: VWE and VWEWW) (“VWE” or the “Company”), one of the top wine producers in the U.S., today reported its financial results for the three and six months ended December 31, 2023 (""second quarter fiscal 2024""). Seth Kaufman, President and CEO, commented, “We are intensely focused on our priorities to aggressively execute our turnaround plan as we transform into a nimble, omnichannel wine company that offers a unique portfolio of the highest quality Super Premium+ products in the U.S. Cash generation in the second quarter validates our efforts to monetize inventory and better manage working capital. We have accelerated our efforts to preserve cash through restructuring and have taken measurable steps towards streamlining the business to a competitively advantaged, defensible core portfolio. We are actively working to sell assets to reduce debt and continue to optimize operations to further improve cash generation.” Mr. Kaufman went on to say, “I am encouraged with the progress we are making with our asset sales process given the quantity and quality of our discussions with prospective buyers. Our concerted effort has resulted in numerous attractive indications of interest, bids and a non-binding letter of intent across stand-alone DTC operations, certain production services businesses, and other non-core assets. The sale of these assets will provide cash to reduce debt and we believe will simultaneously help us to substantially reduce costs which have been elevated by these less profitable businesses. We expect the simplification of our operations will also enable us to better deploy human and financial resources to create an omnichannel business that leverages our market access across wholesale partners, tasting rooms, wine clubs and ecommerce in order to acquire, engage, retain, and delight consumers. We expect the restructured foundation of our enterprise that we are working toward will result in a meaningfully smaller revenue base that can ultimately support faster growth while delivering profitability more in line with best-in-class branded beverage alcohol businesses.” Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Results Review (compared with restated prior-year period unless otherwise noted) Net revenue was $68.0 million, down $10.4 million across all business segments. Approximately 58%, or $7.0 million, of the decline was related to the impact of simplification and reallocation of resources including $3.6 million lower in bulk whiskey sales. Other factors impacting revenue were customer program timing and softer end market demand. Cost of goods sold was $83.0 million, which included a $32.3 million provision for inventory comprised of reducing the value of non-core products and aged inventory as well as bulk wine inventory related to the company’s narrowed brand focus. SG&A, which excludes amortization expense, decreased $6.9 million to $25.3 million. Lower SG&A reflects lower stock-based compensation expense, reduced marketing expenses on non-core product lines, improved freight management and tighter cost controls. Loss from operations in the quarter was $40.7 million. Interest expense was $6.1 million, an increase of $0.5 million, or 8.3%, on higher interest rates. Net loss attributable to VWE common stockholders was $49.4 million, compared with $129.1 million in the prior-year period. On a per diluted share basis, net loss attributable to VWE common stockholders was $(0.83) compared with net loss of $(2.19) per diluted share in the prior-year period. Second quarter fiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA1 was $(28.8) million compared with adjusted EBITDA of $5.0 million in the prior-year period. _____________________________________ 1 As referenced here and throughout the release, adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. Please see related disclosures regarding the use of non-GAAP measures in this news release. Balance Sheet and Cash Generation Cash from operations in the second quarter was $11.9 million reflecting inventory reductions, aggressive efforts to collect receivables and carefully managing payables. Inventories were down $44.1 million, or 22%, from September 30, 2023. The decline reflects the $32.3 million reserve as well as monetization of non-core and aged inventory. Property, plant and equipment was reduced by $27.5 million primarily as a result of $26.4 million in net assets being categorized as held for sale at December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $21.4 million in cash and $305.6 million of current debt outstanding. Total debt increased $2.3 million from $303.3 million at June 30, 2023 but decreased $3.9 million from $309.5 million at September 30, 2023. The Company announced on March 5, 2024 that its lender group has accepted its plans to reorganize and dispose of certain assets and has provided an agreement to forbear exercising their rights and remedies under the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement as amended on October 12, 2023 (the “Second A&R Loan and Security Agreement”), in respect of, or arising out of, certain defaults under the Second A&R Loan and Security Agreement until the earlier of March 31, 2024 or in the event of any other event of default other than those designated in the agreement. As previously disclosed, the Second A&R Loan and Security Agreement currently has principal amounts outstanding of $324.3 million at February 29, 2024. The forbearance agreement provides flexibility for the Company to continue executing the previously announced restructuring and transformation while working with its lenders on an amended credit agreement. If the Company does not meet the terms of the forbearance agreement or if the events of default continue past the term of the forbearance agreement, and if the agent and lenders accelerate the maturity of the debt thereunder, the Company does not have sufficient cash to repay the outstanding debt. At December 31, 2023, approximately 40% of debt was hedged at a blended rate of 2.3% until 2025. 180-day extension to continue trading on Nasdaq and regain compliance The Company’s application for transfer to the Capital Markets was approved by Nasdaq. VWE received confirmation today that it has been granted an additional 180-day extension for the Company to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1), which requires the bid price of VWE Common Shares to close at or above US$1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. The Company now has until September 9, 2024 to regain compliance. The Company filed a Form 8-K on September 19, 2023 regarding its receipt of notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) stating that the Company was not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. About Vintage Wine Estates, Inc. Vintage Wine Estates brings to market a unique portfolio of cider and Super Premium+ wines at $15+ per bottle. The Company focuses on building enduring and differentiated brands that resonate with consumers to generate increasing organic demand in the U.S. It leverages brand-affiliated wine clubs, tasting rooms, and owned ecommerce sites in conjunction with deep wholesale relationships to offer consumers a holistic, omnichannel experience. VWE’s ambition is to be one of the fastest growing players in the branded wine space with best-in-class profitability and consistent cash generation to create value for all stakeholders. The Company is doubling down on a culture that is uniquely consumer-centric and intensely data-driven in service of over fifteen core wine brands spanning approachably priced lifestyle labels and high-scoring premium brands. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to reporting net income/(loss) and net income/(loss) margin prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), VWE uses adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income/(loss) and adjusted net income/(loss) per share to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies. Beginning for the three months ended September 30, 2023, Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, casualty losses or gains, impairment losses, changes in the fair value of derivatives, restructuring related income or expenses, acquisition and integration costs, and certain non-cash, nonrecurring, or other items that are included in net income that VWE does not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance. Prior to the three months ended September 30, 2023, we used net income (loss) in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. We believe the use of net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is more helpful than net income (loss) in evaluating our operating performance because it excludes amounts attributable to non-controlling interests. Adjusted EBITDA margin is the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net revenue. Presentations of Adjusted EBTDA EBITDA and Adjusted EBTDA EBITDA margin for prior periods have been recast to conform to the current period presentation. Adjusted net income/(loss) is defined as net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders as reported adjusted for the impacts of amortization of intangible assets, acquisition integration costs, gains or losses on disposition of assets, gain on litigation of proceeds, COVID impact, and inventory acquisition basis adjustment and also adjusted for a normalized tax rate. Adjusted net income/(loss) per share is calculated based on the weighted average shares outstanding for the period. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income/(loss) and adjusted net income/(loss) per share are not recognized measures of financial performance under GAAP. VWE believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into the underlying trends of VWE’s business and assist in analyzing VWE’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that VWE does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance, which allows for a better comparison against historical results and expectations for future performance. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income/(loss), and adjusted net income/(loss) per share have certain limitations as analytical tools, and they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures, as presented, may produce results that vary from the most comparable GAAP measure and may not be comparable with a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies. In evaluating adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income/(loss), and adjusted net income/(loss) per share, be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. VWE’s presentation of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income/(loss), and adjusted net income/(loss) per share should not be construed as an implication that future results will be unaffected by the types of items excluded from the calculation of these non-GAAP measures. Key Performance Indicators A key performance indicator (""KPI"") is generally defined as a quantifiable measurement or metric used to gauge performance, specifically to help determine strategic, financial, and operational achievements, especially compared to those of similar businesses. Case volume represents the number of 9-liter equivalent cases of wine that we sell during a particular period. Case volumes are an important indicator of what is driving gross margin. This metric also allows us to develop our supply and production targets for future periods.

Toll Brothers Announces 10% Increase to Quarterly Cash Dividend,2024-03-12T20:30:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL) announces a 10% increase in quarterly cash dividend to shareholders, marking the fourth consecutive year of dividend growth.","Toll Brothers Announces 10% Increase to Quarterly Cash Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL) announces a 10% increase in quarterly cash dividend to shareholders, marking the fourth consecutive year of dividend growth. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The increase in the quarterly cash dividend by Toll Brothers signals a positive message to the market regarding the company's financial health and future outlook. A consistent rise in dividends, now for the fourth consecutive year, often reflects a stable and potentially growing profit margin. This could indicate that the company has a reliable revenue stream and a prudent capital allocation strategy, which is attractive to investors seeking both growth and income.It is important to note that the dividend yield, calculated as the annual dividend per share divided by the price per share, will be affected by this increase. However, the yield must be evaluated in the context of the overall market conditions, interest rates and the company's stock performance. Investors will be interested in the payout ratio as well, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders, as it provides insight into the sustainability of the dividend. Market Research Analyst The luxury homebuilding industry can be cyclical, influenced by economic factors such as interest rates, employment rates and overall economic health. Toll Brothers' decision to increase its dividend could reflect not only its financial stability but also a broader optimism about the luxury real estate market. The company's performance and investor confidence might be buoyed by current market trends, such as a demand for high-end homes in certain geographic regions.However, investors should also consider the potential risks associated with the sector, including economic downturns or shifts in consumer preferences. A comprehensive analysis of industry trends, competitive positioning and consumer demand is essential to understand the potential impact of Toll Brothers' dividend increase on its stock value and market performance. Economist The announcement of a dividend increase can be a window into the broader economic landscape, especially in sectors sensitive to economic cycles like luxury homebuilding. It suggests that Toll Brothers may be experiencing favorable economic conditions, such as low-interest rates that facilitate mortgage financing and a strong job market that empowers more consumers to purchase luxury homes.Long-term implications of such a dividend increase could include a positive feedback loop where rising dividends attract more investors, potentially raising the stock price. However, it's also crucial to monitor the housing market indicators and macroeconomic factors that could affect consumer spending on luxury goods, as these will ultimately drive the company's ability to maintain its dividend policy. 03/12/2024 - 04:30 PM FORT WASHINGTON, Pa., March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Toll Brothers, Inc.

OPAL Fuels Announces Exchange of High-Voting Stock for Low-Voting Stock by Controlling Stockholder,2024-03-12T20:30:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"OPAL Fuels Inc. announced that its controlling shareholder, Fortistar LLC, exchanged shares to reduce voting control, potentially making the Company's Class A common stock eligible for stock market indices. However, inclusion is not guaranteed to impact stock price.","OPAL Fuels Announces Exchange of High-Voting Stock for Low-Voting Stock by Controlling Stockholder Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary OPAL Fuels Inc. announced that its controlling shareholder, Fortistar LLC, exchanged shares to reduce voting control, potentially making the Company's Class A common stock eligible for stock market indices. However, inclusion is not guaranteed to impact stock price. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst From a market research perspective, the exchange of shares from Class D to Class B by OPAL Fuels Inc.'s controlling shareholder, Fortistar LLC, is a strategic move that could potentially increase the stock's liquidity and attractiveness to a broader range of investors. Index inclusion often leads to a higher demand for a stock, as it becomes a must-own for index funds and passively managed investment vehicles that track these indices. However, it's important to note that inclusion in stock market indices is not guaranteed and depends on various criteria such as market capitalization, liquidity and sector representation.While the economic interest of Fortistar remains unchanged, the reduction in voting power could be seen as a positive step towards democratizing the company's governance structure, making it more appealing to investors who favor companies with less concentrated control. This could potentially lead to a re-rating of the stock as governance and shareholder rights are important factors in investment decision-making. Financial Analyst As a financial analyst, it is essential to consider the implications of this transaction on the company's valuation and investor perception. The exchange of shares does not affect Fortistar's economic interest, which indicates stability in the company's financial backing. However, the dilution of voting rights could be interpreted as a move to align with corporate governance best practices, potentially leading to improved investor confidence.Investors should monitor the company's progress towards index inclusion, as it could increase the stock's visibility and potentially lead to an uptick in trading volume. However, it is also crucial to exercise caution, as the chairman's statement makes it clear that there is no certainty regarding the inclusion or its impact on the stock price. This uncertainty should be factored into any valuation models and investment strategies. Legal Expert Legally, the exchange of Class D to Class B shares is a non-dilutive transaction that maintains Fortistar's economic stake in OPAL Fuels Inc. while altering the governance dynamics. Such a change in voting rights can be interpreted as a move towards a more equitable voting structure. This can be seen as aligning with shareholder activism trends where investors are increasingly advocating for one-share-one-vote principles.It is also pertinent to consider any potential regulatory implications of this move, particularly if the company's securities are to be included in stock market indices. Regulatory compliance with the rules of the index and the broader market can influence investor sentiment and the company's compliance costs. Companies undergoing such restructuring must ensure adherence to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, particularly concerning disclosure and reporting requirements. 03/12/2024 - 04:30 PM WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- OPAL Fuels Inc. (the “Company”) (Nasdaq: OPAL), a vertically integrated leader in the capture and conversion of biomethane into low carbon intensity renewable electricity and renewable natural gas (RNG), announced that its ultimate controlling shareholder, Fortistar LLC (“Fortistar”), has exchanged 71.5 million shares of Class D common stock of the Company held by it, each of which is entitled to five votes per share on all matters on which stockholders generally are entitled to vote, for an equal number of shares of newly issued Class B common stock of the Company, each of which is entitled to one vote on such matters. This transaction has no effect on the economic interest in the Company held by Fortistar. “With Fortistar reducing a significant portion of its voting control, the Company anticipates that its publicly traded Class A common stock will become eligible for inclusion in certain stock market indices, on which many broad-based mutual funds and exchange-trade index funds are based,” said Mark Comora, the Company’s Chairman. Note that the Company cannot ensure that the Company’s Class A common stock will be included in any stock market indices as a result of this exchange, which is out of the Company’s control, or that, if its stock is included, that it will have any effect on the price per share of the Company’s Class A common stock. About OPAL Fuels Inc. OPAL Fuels Inc. is a vertically integrated leader in the capture and conversion of biomethane into low carbon intensity renewable natural gas (RNG) and Renewable Power. OPAL Fuels is also a leader in the marketing and distribution of RNG to heavy duty trucking and other hard to de-carbonize industrial sectors. RNG is chemically identical to the natural gas used for cooking, heating homes, and fueling natural gas engines, with one significant difference: RNG is produced by recycling harmful biomethane emissions created by decaying organic waste as opposed to natural gas which is a fossil fuel pumped from the ground.

ODDITY Announces Secondary Offering of Class A Ordinary Shares,2024-03-12T20:16:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"ODDITY Tech Ltd. announced a secondary public offering of 4,000,000 Class A ordinary shares by a fund managed by L Catterton, with an option for additional shares.

Major investment banks are managing the offering.","ODDITY Announces Secondary Offering of Class A Ordinary Shares Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary ODDITY Tech Ltd. announced a secondary public offering of 4,000,000 Class A ordinary shares by a fund managed by L Catterton, with an option for additional shares. ODDITY will not receive proceeds from the sale. Major investment banks are managing the offering. Positive None. Negative ODDITY will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares in the offering, potentially impacting the company's financial position negatively. Financial Analyst The secondary public offering of 4,000,000 Class A ordinary shares by ODDITY Tech Ltd. represents a significant liquidity event for the Selling Stockholder, L Catterton. The potential addition of a 30-day option for underwriters to purchase up to an additional 600,000 shares could indicate a strong underwriter confidence in the market's reception of the offering. However, it's critical to assess the impact this may have on the stock's liquidity and potential dilution effects, even though ODDITY itself is not issuing new shares or receiving proceeds.From a market perspective, the involvement of top-tier investment banks as joint lead book-running managers suggests a robust handling of the offering. The prestige and expertise of these banks can often lead to a more favorable pricing and distribution network, which is beneficial for current shareholders. Investors should monitor the stock's performance closely around the offering date, as large offerings can sometimes lead to short-term volatility. Market Research Analyst The announcement of a secondary public offering is a pivotal event for existing and potential investors, as it provides insights into the current shareholders' views on the company's valuation and future prospects. In the case of ODDITY, the Selling Stockholder's decision to sell a portion of their holdings might be interpreted in various ways. It could be seen as taking profits after a period of appreciation, or possibly as a move to diversify their portfolio.Understanding the market's perception of such an offering is crucial. If the offering is seen as a vote of confidence, it could lead to increased investor interest. Conversely, if the market interprets the sale as a lack of confidence by a major investor, it could potentially apply downward pressure on the share price. Analyzing past secondary offerings in the tech sector could provide comparative insights into the potential market reaction. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding the secondary offering is of paramount importance. The registration statement's status, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) but not yet effective, is a procedural step that must be finalized before any sales can occur. This ensures compliance with federal securities laws and provides potential investors with essential information about the offering. It's important for investors to understand that the preliminary prospectus will contain vital details regarding the offering and any investment decision should be made on the basis of the final prospectus.The disclaimer about the offering not constituting an offer to sell securities until the registration statement becomes effective is standard legal practice to avoid premature solicitation. This also highlights the regulatory safeguards in place to protect investors, which is an important consideration for maintaining market integrity and investor confidence. 03/12/2024 - 04:16 PM NEW YORK, March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ODDITY Tech Ltd.

The transaction is projected to close in mid to late 2024, reinforcing key supplier relationships to maintain Mattress Firm's status as a leading multi-branded retailer.","Tempur Sealy Provides Update on Mattress Firm Acquisition Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Tempur Sealy International, Inc. provides an update on the acquisition of Mattress Firm Group Inc., expecting the FTC review to conclude by the end of the second quarter. The transaction is projected to close in mid to late 2024, reinforcing key supplier relationships to maintain Mattress Firm's status as a leading multi-branded retailer. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Mattress Firm by Tempur Sealy International represents a significant consolidation within the mattress retail industry. This move will likely enhance Tempur Sealy's market presence and distribution capabilities, considering Mattress Firm's status as the largest specialty mattress retailer in the U.S. It is crucial to assess the competitive landscape post-acquisition, as a combined entity could command greater pricing power and a broader product range, potentially affecting competitors' market shares.Furthermore, the strategic solidification of supplier relationships ahead of the acquisition's closure indicates proactive supply chain management, which is essential in an industry susceptible to disruptions. The inclusion of Purple Innovation, Inc. as a new supplier suggests an expansion of offerings and a commitment to diversity in product lines, which may appeal to a broader consumer base and drive sales growth. However, investors should monitor the FTC's review process closely, as regulatory hurdles can impact the timeline and terms of the deal, subsequently influencing the stock's performance. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the acquisition's successful completion could lead to economies of scale for Tempur Sealy, potentially resulting in cost savings and margin improvements. By acquiring Mattress Firm, Tempur Sealy is not just expanding its retail footprint but is also ensuring that its products have prominent placement within a leading retail chain. The post-closing supply agreements with six other mattress manufacturers, including Purple Innovation, Inc., indicate a strategy to maintain Mattress Firm's multi-brand retailer model, which can diversify revenue streams and reduce reliance on any single supplier.Investors should consider the impact of the acquisition on Tempur Sealy's balance sheet, particularly in terms of debt levels and cash flow implications. The long-term benefits of the acquisition, such as increased market share and enhanced competitive positioning, must be weighed against the short-term financial costs and integration risks. The deal's financing structure will also be an area of interest, as it could affect the company's financial flexibility and credit ratings. Legal Expert The FTC's review of the acquisition is a pivotal factor that could determine the deal's progression. Antitrust considerations are paramount in such reviews, with the FTC examining whether the acquisition could lead to a substantial lessening of competition. A thorough legal analysis of potential market concentration effects is necessary, as the outcome could lead to conditions being imposed on the deal or, in extreme cases, its blockage. Tempur Sealy's expectation that the review will complete by the end of the second quarter provides a tentative timeline, but investors should remain aware that such processes can face delays.Moreover, the legal complexities of integrating two large entities involve meticulous planning to ensure compliance with all relevant laws and regulations. The post-closing supply agreements mentioned are likely part of this legal preparation, securing the continuity of business operations. The legal team's ability to navigate the regulatory landscape will be crucial to the timely and successful completion of the acquisition. 03/12/2024 - 04:30 PM – Expects FTC to complete its review by the end of the second quarter – Continues to expect the transaction to close in mid to late 2024 – Further solidifies key supplier relationships to maintain Mattress Firm's position as a leading multi-branded retailer LEXINGTON, Ky., March 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Tempur Sealy International, Inc. (NYSE: TPX, ""Company"" or ""Tempur Sealy"") today provided an update with respect to the Company's acquisition of Mattress Firm Group Inc. (""Mattress Firm""). On May 9, 2023, Tempur Sealy signed a definitive agreement to acquire Mattress Firm, the largest mattress specialty retailer in the U.S. The Company continues to work with the Federal Trade Commission (""FTC"") to advance the transaction, and now expects that the FTC will complete its review by the end of the second quarter. Consistent with previous expectations, the Company continues to expect the transaction to close in mid to late 2024. Tempur Sealy and Mattress Firm continue to make joint progress in planning for post-closing, including solidifying Mattress Firm's key supplier relationships ahead of the expected closing. Since announcing the acquisition, Tempur Sealy has executed post-closing supply agreements with six (6) other mattress manufacturers, including Purple Innovation, Inc. These contracts are consistent with the Company's plan for Mattress Firm to continue as a multi-branded retailer. Tempur Sealy Chairman and CEO Scott Thompson commented, ""Since announcing the acquisition in May, Tempur Sealy has signed post-closing supply agreements with numerous existing Mattress Firm suppliers, as well as a new supply agreement with a manufacturer not currently supplying Mattress Firm. We have engaged a critical mass of suppliers to provide a robust and diverse offering of high quality bedding products to Mattress Firm customers. These developments are consistent with our plan and expectation that Mattress Firm will continue as a multi-branded retailer post-closing. We look forward to working with quality suppliers and the Mattress Firm organization to facilitate continued innovation and improve the sleep of consumers.""

General Electric Company is expected to exchange the GEHC Shares for indebtedness held by Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. Following the debt-for-equity exchange, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC intends to sell the GEHC Shares to the underwriter in the Offering. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of a secondary underwritten public offering of 13,000,000 shares by GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. represents a significant event for current and potential investors. It is crucial to understand that GE HealthCare itself is not selling any shares, thus not diluting its equity or receiving proceeds. Instead, this transaction allows General Electric Company to exchange shares for debt reduction with Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., which is a strategic financial move.From a financial perspective, this debt-for-equity swap indicates GE's intent to improve its balance sheet by reducing leverage. For investors, the immediate impact may be negligible since the company's fundamentals remain unchanged. However, in the long term, a stronger balance sheet could lead to a re-rating of GE HealthCare's stock as it may imply lower financial risk and potential for improved financial flexibility.Moreover, the involvement of Morgan Stanley as the sole book-running manager suggests confidence in the ability to place these shares in the market. The option for the underwriter to purchase additional shares could also signal anticipated demand or a bullish outlook on the stock's performance. The use of a shelf registration statement indicates preparedness for future offerings, which could be a sign of strategic financing agility. Market Research Analyst Secondary offerings are often market events that can affect the stock price due to the potential for increased liquidity and changes in supply and demand dynamics. The market's response to such offerings can be mixed, depending on the investor perception of the company's growth prospects and the reason behind the offering.In the case of GE HealthCare, the offering's structure as a debt-for-equity exchange rather than a typical capital raise may be viewed more favorably, as it does not involve the issuance of new shares by the company. The market impact could be more subdued than in cases where the company is the direct seller of the stock. Nevertheless, the offering could still influence the stock's trading volume and volatility in the short term, especially as the underwriter begins to sell the shares.It is also worth noting that the transaction's timing and the decision to execute it via a public offering rather than a private transaction may be indicative of the company's market strategy and confidence in its stock's liquidity. Investors will closely monitor the price at which the shares are sold, as it could provide a benchmark for the stock's value in the near future. Legal Expert The use of an automatically effective shelf registration statement for the offering is a legal mechanism that allows for a more expedient and flexible way to issue securities. This method enables the company to take advantage of favorable market conditions quickly. For legal practitioners and investors, the key takeaway is the efficiency and foresight in regulatory compliance and corporate governance that GE HealthCare is demonstrating.Furthermore, the relationship between GE, Morgan Stanley Bank and the subsequent sale to the underwriter involves complex legal agreements. These agreements must ensure regulatory adherence, particularly with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules. The option granted to the underwriter for additional share purchases introduces another layer of legal considerations, particularly in terms of disclosure and fair dealing.Understanding the legal framework behind such transactions is essential for stakeholders to appreciate the safeguards in place to protect their interests and the integrity of the market. It also underscores the importance of transparency and due diligence in corporate transactions that can impact shareholder value. 03/12/2024 - 04:34 PM CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (Nasdaq: GEHC) (the “Company” or “GE HealthCare”) announced today the launch of a secondary underwritten public offering (the “Offering”) of 13,000,000 shares of its common stock (the “GEHC Shares”).

(the “MS Lender”), an affiliate of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, the selling stockholder in the Offering by designation of the MS Lender. Following the debt-for-equity exchange, if consummated, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as the selling stockholder in the Offering, intends to sell the GEHC Shares to the underwriter in the Offering. The selling stockholder in the Offering has granted the underwriter an option to purchase additional shares of GE HealthCare common stock for settlement on or before March 28, 2024. Morgan Stanley is acting as the sole book-running manager for the Offering. Morgan Stanley proposes to offer the GEHC Shares from time to time in one or more transactions on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, in the over-the-counter market or through negotiated transactions at market prices or at negotiated prices.

(SISI) has regained compliance with the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement, with its common stock price being at least $1.00 per share for 15 consecutive business days. The company received formal notice from Nasdaq confirming compliance, signaling positive news for shareholders. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent announcement from Shineco, Inc. regarding its compliance with the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement is a significant development for the company and its investors. The compliance indicates that Shineco's stock has maintained a closing bid price of at least $1.00 for 15 consecutive business days, which can be seen as a reflection of investor confidence and market acceptance of the company's business strategy and outlook.From a market research perspective, this compliance lifts the immediate threat of delisting, which can have severe repercussions, including reduced liquidity and access to capital. It is also a signal to potential investors that the company meets Nasdaq's standards, which could potentially increase the stock's attractiveness. However, it is important to note that while meeting this requirement is positive, it is only one aspect of the company's overall health. Investors should consider other financial metrics and company fundamentals when evaluating Shineco's long-term potential. Financial Analyst Regaining compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement is often seen as a positive step towards stabilizing a company's stock price and can provide a more favorable environment for raising capital. For Shineco, this development might ease investor concerns regarding the stability and future of the company on the stock market. A stabilized stock price above the $1 threshold also helps in avoiding the potential costs and stigma associated with being listed on less prestigious exchanges.However, it is important for investors to analyze whether the price sustainability was due to inherent business improvements or external market conditions. They should also look for trends in the company's revenue growth, profit margins and R&D investments to assess the potential for future growth. A closer examination of the company's quarterly financial reports and future guidance would provide a more comprehensive understanding of its financial health. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, compliance with Nasdaq's Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) is crucial for Shineco to maintain its listing on a major exchange. The formal notice of compliance signifies that the company has successfully navigated the regulatory requirements set forth by Nasdaq, which governs the listing standards for publicly traded companies. This compliance is not only a technical requirement but also serves as a testament to the company's governance and its ability to meet regulatory standards.It is important for current and prospective shareholders to understand that while this compliance resolves an immediate regulatory concern, it does not provide immunity against future non-compliance. Continuous monitoring of the company's adherence to all relevant listing requirements is necessary to ensure long-term stability and to uphold shareholder interests. 03/12/2024 - 04:30 PM BEIJING, March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Shineco, Inc.

Coinbase Announces Proposed Private Offering of $1.0 Billion of Convertible Senior Notes Due 2030,2024-03-12T20:23:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Coinbase Global, Inc. announces a private offering of $1.0 billion Convertible Senior Notes due 2030, with additional $150.0 million option.

Coinbase intends to use the proceeds for debt repayment, general corporate purposes, and potential investments or acquisitions.","Coinbase Announces Proposed Private Offering of $1.0 Billion of Convertible Senior Notes Due 2030 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Coinbase Global, Inc. announces a private offering of $1.0 billion Convertible Senior Notes due 2030, with additional $150.0 million option. The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of Coinbase's Class A common stock, or a combination thereof. Coinbase intends to use the proceeds for debt repayment, general corporate purposes, and potential investments or acquisitions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Convertible senior notes are a form of debt financing that can be converted into equity, typically common stock, at the discretion of the bondholder or under specific conditions. The issuance of $1.0 billion in convertible notes by Coinbase is a strategic move to manage its debt profile by potentially reducing the interest expense and extending the maturity of its obligations. The additional option to purchase up to $150 million to cover over-allotments indicates a buffer for higher demand, which can be a positive signal to the market.Moreover, the decision to enter into capped call transactions is a hedge against dilution for existing shareholders. It suggests that Coinbase is proactively managing the potential equity impact of the conversion feature. This can be beneficial for the stock price as it provides a level of predictability and stability. The market's reaction to such financial instruments often depends on the terms of the conversion and the perceived future growth of the company. A high conversion premium could indicate confidence in the company's prospects, while a low premium might suggest the opposite.Investors and analysts will closely monitor the interest rate and conversion rate set upon pricing, as these will affect the level of dilution and the cost of capital for Coinbase. The implied volatility of Coinbase's stock, as well as the broader cryptocurrency market conditions, will be key factors in determining these rates. Market Research Analyst The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, which impacts companies like Coinbase directly. The offering of convertible notes may be seen as a move to strengthen the company's balance sheet against such volatility. By repaying or repurchasing existing notes, Coinbase is likely aiming to optimize its capital structure and interest expenses in anticipation of future market conditions.Investors will be interested in how these financial maneuvers correlate with Coinbase's operational strategies, such as investments in or acquisitions of other companies. Such activities could signal Coinbase's commitment to expanding its business model or entering new markets. The potential dilution from the conversion of these notes is a concern for current shareholders, but the capped call transactions aim to mitigate this impact.Lastly, the secondary market activities of the option counterparties could influence Coinbase's stock price. Investors should consider the potential implications of these transactions on stock price volatility and conversion decisions. Legal Expert The offering is being made to qualified institutional buyers in compliance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act, which allows for the sale of securities to sophisticated investors without the need for a public offering. This private placement nature limits the pool of potential investors but also simplifies the regulatory requirements and speeds up the process.It's important to note that the notes and any shares issued upon conversion have not been registered under the Securities Act, hence they are subject to restrictions on resale. The legal framework surrounding convertible notes is complex and the potential for legal challenges exists, particularly in scenarios where noteholders may dispute the terms of conversion or if there are allegations of market manipulation through the derivative transactions by the option counterparties.The language of the announcement indicates caution, emphasizing that this is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, which is standard to avoid contravening securities regulations. 03/12/2024 - 04:23 PM Remote-First-Company/PORTLAND, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Coinbase Global, Inc. (“Coinbase”) (Nasdaq: COIN) today announced its intention to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2030 (the “notes”) in a private offering (the “offering”) to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Coinbase also expects to grant the initial purchasers of the notes a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $150.0 million principal amount of notes solely to cover over-allotments. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Coinbase, will accrue interest payable semi-annually in arrears and will mature on April 1, 2030, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of Coinbase’s Class A common stock, or a combination thereof, at Coinbase’s election. The interest rate, initial conversion rate, and other terms of the notes are to be determined upon pricing of the offering. In connection with the pricing of the notes, Coinbase expects to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers or their affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the “option counterparties”). The capped call transactions will cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of Coinbase’s Class A common stock that will initially underlie the notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to Coinbase’s Class A common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or offset any potential cash payments Coinbase is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. Coinbase has been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Coinbase’s Class A common stock and/or purchase shares of Coinbase’s Class A common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Coinbase’s Class A common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, Coinbase has been advised that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Coinbase’s Class A common stock and/or purchasing or selling Coinbase’s Class A common stock or other securities of Coinbase in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and from time to time prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during the relevant valuation period under the capped call transactions or following any early conversion of the notes, any repurchase of the notes by Coinbase on any fundamental change repurchase date, any redemption date or any other date on which the notes are retired by Coinbase, in each case if Coinbase exercises its option to terminate the relevant portion of the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Coinbase’s Class A common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability of noteholders to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes, it could affect the number of shares of Class A common stock, if any, and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes. Coinbase intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to repay at maturity, or repurchase or redeem prior to maturity, from time to time and subject to market conditions, its outstanding 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026, 3.375% Senior Notes due 2028, and 3.625% Senior Notes due 2031 and for other general corporate purposes, which may include working capital and capital expenditures, and to pay the cost of the capped call transactions. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Coinbase expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of such additional notes to enter into additional capped call transactions. Coinbase may also use a portion of the net proceeds to make investments in and acquisitions of other companies, products or technologies that Coinbase may identify from time to time. The notes will only be offered and sold to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act by means of a private offering memorandum. Neither the notes nor the shares of Coinbase’s Class A common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of the notes, if any, have been, or will be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States, except pursuant to an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the notes or any shares of Class A common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of the notes and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation, or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale is unlawful.

Commitment to drive shareholder value through milestone achievements and commercialization progress. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The merger between XTI Aircraft Company and Inpixon resulting in the formation of XTI Aerospace, Inc. represents a significant strategic development within the aerospace sector. The potential to generate over $7 billion in gross revenues from more than 700 conditional pre-orders for the TriFan 600 vertical lift crossover airplane (VLCA) indicates a strong market interest in innovative private air transportation solutions. This interest is spurred by the TriFan 600's promise to offer the versatility of a helicopter with the performance of a fixed-wing aircraft, catering to diverse segments including business, medevac, leisure and cargo.Market demand for efficient and versatile air travel solutions is growing, driven by increasing global mobility and the need for rapid point-to-point transportation. The TriFan 600's unique value proposition could disrupt traditional private aviation market dynamics by providing a new category of air mobility. However, the successful commercialization of the TriFan 600 will hinge on XTI Aerospace's ability to meet its performance goals and adhere to the projected timelines for development, testing and delivery of the aircraft. Financial Analyst The financial implications of the merger and the subsequent commercialization of the TriFan 600 are substantial. With over 700 conditional pre-orders, XTI Aerospace's projected gross revenue of $7 billion signifies a robust pipeline that could translate into significant future cash flows. However, investors should be aware of the risks associated with the aerospace industry, particularly in the development phase of cutting-edge technology. The costs associated with research, development and certification of new aircraft can be considerable and delays or technical setbacks could impact projected revenues.Furthermore, the change in leadership, with new appointments including Scott Pomeroy as chairman and CEO, may bring fresh strategic perspectives but also introduces a period of transition that could affect the company's execution of its business plan. Monitoring the progress of the TriFan 600's development milestones will be crucial for stakeholders to assess the company's potential for long-term value creation. Aerospace Industry Expert The aerospace industry is characterized by high barriers to entry, including rigorous regulatory standards and substantial capital requirements for research and development. The TriFan 600, as a vertical lift crossover airplane, is an example of the industry's push towards innovation in vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities. The successful integration of XTI's aircraft development with Inpixon's RTLS technology could provide XTI Aerospace with a competitive edge in operational efficiency and safety.However, the path to market for new aerospace technologies is often lengthy and complex, involving extensive testing and certification processes by aviation authorities. XTI Aerospace's ability to navigate these challenges will be critical to the TriFan 600's success. The company's focus on a diverse range of private air travel segments also suggests a strategic approach to market penetration, aiming to establish the TriFan 600 as a versatile solution in a market that is increasingly seeking flexibility and convenience in air travel. 03/12/2024 - 04:45 PM XTI Aerospace, Inc.

The sale aims to strengthen the company's portfolio and reduce debt, enhancing liquidity for future investments. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The divestiture of the Avinode Group by World Kinect Corporation for $200 million in cash to CAMP Systems International is a significant financial event that merits a closer look from a valuation and capital allocation perspective. The announced use of proceeds to repay debt is a prudent financial decision, likely to be well-received by the market. Reducing annual interest expenses by $10 million not only improves the company's net income due to lower financial costs but also enhances credit metrics, potentially leading to a better credit rating and lower future borrowing costs.Furthermore, the injection of liquidity into World Kinect's balance sheet provides flexibility for strategic investments, particularly in its core distribution platform and emerging sustainability offerings. This may signal a strategic pivot or intensification of focus in areas where management sees higher growth potential or better returns on investment. Investors should monitor how these investments translate into revenue growth and margin expansion in the medium to long term. Market Research Analyst From a market dynamics perspective, the sale of the Avinode Group, a leading air charter sourcing platform, suggests a consolidation within the aviation software market. As CAMP Systems International absorbs Avinode's portfolio, there could be implications for competition and customer choice in the sector. It's crucial to assess whether this transaction will lead to increased market power for CAMP and how that could affect pricing and innovation.Additionally, World Kinect's focus on its core distribution platform and sustainability offerings post-sale indicates a strategic shift that aligns with broader market trends towards sustainability. This move could open up new market opportunities and partnerships, particularly as industries increasingly prioritize sustainable practices. Investors should consider the potential for World Kinect to capture market share in this emergent area, which could be a driver for long-term growth. Legal Expert It is important to note the transaction's dependence on regulatory approvals, a common hurdle in significant mergers and acquisitions. The outcome of regulatory scrutiny could impact the timing and final terms of the deal. Any conditions imposed by regulators could alter the expected benefits or costs associated with the transaction. Stakeholders should be aware of the regulatory landscape, including antitrust considerations, which could influence the approval process and the competitive environment post-acquisition.Moreover, the stipulated 60-day expected completion timeframe provides a window for due diligence and satisfies customary closing conditions. Investors should be attentive to any announcements or delays during this period, as they could indicate potential issues or changes in the deal's structure that might affect World Kinect Corporation's financial projections and strategic plans. 03/12/2024 - 04:15 PM MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- World Kinect Corporation (NYSE: WKC) announced today it has signed a definitive agreement to sell the Avinode Group, the world’s leading air charter sourcing platform, and its portfolio of aviation FBO software products to CAMP Systems International, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Hearst, for approximately $200 million in cash. “This sale represents another step in sharpening our portfolio, all while generating a solid return,” said Michael J.

Positive Sequential increase in Gross Margin, Cash Flow from Operations, and EPS in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. Focus on operational efficiency, cost reduction, and delivering value to shareholders. Strong balance sheet with reduced senior net leverage ratio and increased operating cash flow. Acquisition of Sureflex, Inc. to enhance manufacturing efficiency and profitability. Negative Decrease in net sales for Q4 2023 and full year 2023 primarily due to lower demand for certain products. Increase in selling and administrative expenses in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. Net income decrease of 22% in 2023 compared to 2022 due to various unfavorable adjustments and expenses. Negative impact on net income from pension cost adjustments and closure of Associated Toolmakers Ltd. Financial Analyst The reported increase in Gross Margin to 26.8% in Q4 2023 from 16.6% in Q4 2022 is a significant improvement, indicating a stronger control over costs or a strategic shift in pricing. This is a critical metric as it reflects the company's ability to manage production costs relative to sales, which is crucial for profitability. The ability to generate increased cash flow from operations, allowing for a $20.2 million debt paydown, is indicative of healthy operational efficiency and enhances the company's financial stability. The rise in Earnings Per Share (EPS) to $0.56 in Q4 2023 from $0.03 in Q4 2022 suggests a substantial increase in profitability, which could positively influence investor sentiment and potentially the company's stock price. However, the full-year net income decrease of 22% warrants further investigation into the factors impacting profitability despite the positive quarterly performance. Market Research Analyst Despite the positive quarterly results, the decrease in net sales year-over-year by 2.0% highlights potential challenges in market demand, particularly in the sectors of truck accessories and returnable transport packaging products. The increased backlog, however, suggests that there is still a healthy pipeline of future revenue. The market context, including supply chain normalization and challenges faced by commercial truck suppliers in adding capacity, may have broader implications for the industrial manufacturing sector. The strategic focus on operational efficiency, capital utilization and targeted acquisitions, such as Sureflex, Inc., indicates a proactive approach to navigating a competitive landscape and pursuing growth through both organic and inorganic means. Operational Efficiency Expert The 'One Eastern' approach to optimizing supply chain operations reflects an industry trend towards consolidation and streamlined operations to reduce costs. The acquisition of Sureflex, Inc. is an example of vertical integration, which can lead to improved manufacturing efficiency and reduced supply chain costs. The reduction of the senior net leverage ratio from 2.27 to 1.41 is a positive sign of improved financial health, signaling a stronger position for future investments. It is essential to monitor how these operational changes translate into long-term profitability and competitive advantage, especially given the increased selling and administrative expenses, which rose 19.9% in Q4 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. 03/12/2024 - 04:30 PM Gross Margin increased sequentially in each quarter of 2023, rising to 26.8% in Q4 2023 compared to 16.6% in Q4 2022.Cash flow from operations for the year ended December 30, 2023 increased $19.0 million compared to fiscal 2022, enabling debt paydown of $20.2 million.EPS increased sequentially in each quarter of 2023, rising to $0.56 per diluted share in Q4 2023 compared to $0.03 in Q4 2022.Strong fourth quarter caps a year of significant changes designed to optimize operations and restore consistent profitability as evidenced by improvements in earnings from operations.SHELTON, CT / ACCESSWIRE / March 12, 2024 / The Eastern Company (""Eastern"") (NASDAQ:EML), an industrial manufacturer of unique engineered solutions serving commercial transportation, logistics, and other industrial markets, today announced the results of operations for the fourth fiscal quarter and full year ended December 30, 2023.President and CEO Mark Hernandez commented, ""2023 was a year of substantial and very positive change for The Eastern Company. With a new leadership team at the helm, we initiated a series of actions to enhance Eastern's operating efficiency, reduce costs and intensify the company's focus on delivering value to shareholders. Our chief goal for 2023 was to position Eastern to achieve efficient operations that consistently deliver strong results. Our team's new approach delivered four consecutive quarters of increasing strength as our operational improvement initiatives took hold and, as we expected, culminated in a very strong final quarter.""We are very pleased with the results our four-pronged strategy -- disciplined operations, optimum capital utilization, focused commercial business and value-adding acquisitions -- enabled us to achieve. Although revenues declined slightly in the fourth quarter as lead times within supply chains decreased, returning closer to historical norms, coupled with the difficulties commercial truck suppliers experienced in adding capacity, we greatly improved gross margin, earnings, and cash flow. We generated strong operating cash flow of $26.5 million in 2023, further strengthening our financial foundation. We also reduced our senior net leverage ratio to 1.41 from 2.27 at the end of fiscal 2022. Our focus on commercial operations and partnering with our customers was a key contributor to these results. The many steps we took within our three operating divisions to reduce inventory and improve on-time delivery helped optimize performance and had an important impact on our results.Mr. Hernandez continued, ""Our plan to drive shareholder value is working well and we are continuing to follow our strategy in 2024. In addition to the four pillars we originally established, we are adding a ""One Eastern"" overlay. Under our One Eastern approach to optimizing our supply chain, we believe we can capture opportunities to reduce manufacturing and supply chain costs, enhance our ability to deliver increases in earnings from operations, and enhance the competitiveness of our products and further profitability. Our June 2023 acquisition of Sureflex, Inc., which enabled our Velvac subsidiary to manufacture electrical products more efficiently, offers a small but telling example. Our greatly strengthened balance sheet increases our opportunity to add accretive acquisitions to Eastern's existing portfolio.""Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial ResultsNet sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased 3.0% to $67.0 million from $69.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net sales for the full year 2023 decreased 2.0% to $273.5 million from $279.3 million in 2022. In both the fourth quarter of 2023 and the full year, sales declined primarily due to lower demand for truck accessories and returnable transport packaging products. Our backlog as of December 30, 2023 increased 10.5% to $80.1 million from $72.5 million on December 31, 2022.Gross margin as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 26.8% compared to 16.6% in the corresponding period in 2022. The increase in margin primarily reflects lower material and freight costs, improved pricing, and a favorable adjustment to the LIFO reserve in the fourth quarter of 2023 combined with other inventory write-offs in the fourth quarter of 2022. In the full year 2023, gross margin as a percentage of sales was 23.8% compared to 21.0% in 2022, primarily due to the impact of improved pricing and lower material and freight costs.Selling and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased $1.9 million, or 19.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to increased payroll and payroll-related expenses, legal and professional, and selling costs. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative costs were 16.8% for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 13.6% for the corresponding period in 2022. In the full year 2023, selling and administrative expenses increased $4.7 million, or 12%, to $44.2 million from $39.5 million in 2022 primarily due to severance and other accrued compensation expenses of $1.8 million related to the elimination of the chief operating officer position and the departure of our previous chief executive officer during the first quarter of 2023 and legal, professional, and selling costs and payroll-related expenses. The increase in selling expenses reflects our investments in sales capabilities and changes in management personnel.Other income and expense in 2023 decreased $3.2 million over 2022. Other income and expense in 2023 included an unfavorable $1.1 million pension cost adjustment, $1.4 million expense associated with the closure of Associated Toolmakers Limited in the second quarter of 2023, an unfavorable working capital adjustment of $0.4 million in the third quarter of 2023 related to the sale of the Greenwald business, partially offset by a $1.6 million favorable adjustment for the final settlement of our swap agreement with Santander in the second quarter of 2023 and $0.7 million of other favorable items. In 2022, other income included a favorable $1.8 million pension cost adjustment, a $0.6 million gain on the sale of the Eastern corporate office building, and $0.4 million of other favorable items, partially offset by a $0.3 million loss on the sale of the Wheeling, IL building.Net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased to $3.5 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, from $0.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted share in the 2022 period. In the fourth quarter of 2022, net income was negatively impacted by restructuring costs of $0.5 million, net of tax, related to a warehouse consolidation into Eberhard. Net income for the full year 2023 decreased 22% to $8.6 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, from $11.1 million, or $1.77 per diluted share, in 2022. In 2023, net income was negatively impacted by unfavorable pension cost adjustments of $1.1 million, $1.4 million expense associated with the closure of Associated Toolmakers Ltd. in the second quarter of 2023, an unfavorable working capital adjustment of $0.4 million in the third quarter of 2023 related to the sale of the Greenwald business, partially offset by a $1.6 million favorable adjustment for the final settlement of our swap agreement with Santander in the second quarter of 2023. In 2022, net income was impacted by favorable pension cost adjustments of $1.8 million, restructuring costs of $0.5 million, net of tax, related to a warehouse consolidation into Eberhard, and a loss on sale of the Wheeling, IL building in the first quarter of 2022 of $0.2 million, net of tax, partially offset by a gain on sale of the Eastern corporate office building in the third quarter of 2022 of $0.5 million, net of tax.Adjusted net income from continuing operations (a non-GAAP measure) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 was $3.5 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income from continuing operations of $0.7 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for the comparable period in 2022. For both the year ended December 30, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022, adjusted net income from continuing operations was $11.3 million, or $1.81 per diluted share.

Other factors include, but are not limited to: restrictions on operating flexibility imposed by the agreement governing our credit facility; risks associated with doing business overseas, including fluctuations in exchange rates and the inability to repatriate foreign cash, the impact on cost structure and on economic conditions as a result of actual and threatened increases in trade tariffs and the impact of political, economic and social instability; the inability to achieve the savings expected from global sourcing of materials;; lower-cost competition; our ability to design, introduce and sell new or updated products and related components; market acceptance of our products; the inability to attain expected benefits from acquisitions or the inability to effectively integrate such acquisitions and achieve expected synergies; domestic and international economic conditions, and more specifically conditions in the automotive, construction, aerospace, energy, oil and gas, transportation, electronic, and general industrial markets; costs and liabilities associated with environmental compliance; the impact of climate change; military conflict (including the Russia/Ukraine conflict, the conflict in Israel and surrounding areas, the possible expansion of such conflicts and geopolitical consequences) or terrorist threats and the possible responses by the U.S. and foreign governments; failure to protect our intellectual property; cyberattacks; materially adverse or unanticipated legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements; and other risks identified and discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on March 12, 2024, and that may be identified from time to time in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other filings we make with the SEC.

The Company undertakes no obligation to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe non-GAAP financial measures we provide in this release should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.To supplement the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have presented Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations, Adjusted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations and Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures in the same way. These measures are not substitutes for their comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as net sales, net income from continuing operations, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, or other measures prescribed by U.S. GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures.Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations is defined as net income from continuing operations excluding, when incurred, gains or losses that we do not believe reflect our ongoing operations, including, for example, the impacts of impairment losses, gains/losses on the sale of subsidiaries, property and facilities, transaction expenses primarily relating to acquisitions and divestitures, factory start-up costs, factory relocation expenses, executive severance, and restructuring costs. Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operating performance.Adjusted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations is defined as earnings per share from continuing operations excluding, when incurred, certain per share gains or losses that we do not believe reflect our ongoing operations, including, for example, the impacts of impairment losses, gains/losses on the sale of subsidiaries, property and facilities, transaction expenses primarily relating to acquisitions and divestitures, factory start-up costs, factory relocation expenses, executive severance, and restructuring costs. We believe that Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share from Continuing Operations provides important comparability of underlying operational results, allowing investors and management to access operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period.Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations is defined as net income from continuing operations before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization and excluding, when incurred, the impacts of certain losses or gains that we do not believe reflect our ongoing operations, including, for example, impairment losses, gains/losses on sale of subsidiaries, property and facilities, transaction expenses primarily relating to acquisitions and divestitures, factory start-up costs, factory relocation expenses, executive severance, and restructuring expenses. Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations.Management uses such measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors, and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. These financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, U.S. GAAP financial measures.We believe that presenting non-GAAP financial measures in addition to U.S. GAAP financial measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management for its financial and operational decision-making. We further believe that providing this information better enables our investors to understand our operating performance and to evaluate the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.Investor Relations ContactsThe Eastern Company Mark Hernandez or Nicholas Vlahos203-729-2255The Eastern CompanyConsolidated Statements of Income Year Ended December 30, December 31, 2023 2022 Net sales $273,454,857 $279,265,146 Cost of products sold (208,501,713) (220,648,900)Gross margin 64,953,144 58,616,246 Product development expense (5,592,355) (4,241,211)Selling and administrative expenses (44,177,459) (39,508,849)Restructuring costs - (699,868)Operating profit 15,183,330 14,166,318 Interest expense (3,506,598) (2,275,612)Other (expense) income (684,790) 2,512,211 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 10,991,942 14,402,917 Income taxes (2,406,940) (3,352,456)Net income from continuing operations $8,585,002 $11,050,461 Discontinued Operations (see note 3) Gain from operations of discontinued units $- $1,360,773 Gain (loss) on sale of businesses - 305,539 Income tax (expense) benefit - (414,855)Net gain (loss) on discontinued operations $- $1,251,457 Net Income $8,585,002 $12,301,918 Earnings per share from continuing operations: Basic $1.38 $1.78 Diluted $1.37 $1.77 Gain (loss) per share from discontinued operations: Basic $- $0.20 Diluted $- $0.20 Total earnings per share: Basic $1.38 $1.98 Diluted $1.37 $1.97 Cash dividends per share: $0.44 $0.44 The Eastern CompanyConsolidated Balance Sheets December 30, December 31, 2023 2022 ASSETS Current Assets Cash and cash equivalents $8,299,453 $10,187,522 Marketable Securities 986,477 - Accounts receivable, less allowances: 2023-$564,816; 2022-$676,678 37,057,488 42,886,250 Inventories: Raw materials and component parts 24,500,087 25,924,696 Work in process 9,957,068 9,323,082 Finished goods 24,815,052 29,388,813 59,272,207 64,636,591 Current portion of note receivable 573,269 1,006,421 Prepaid expenses and other assets 6,047,814 6,598,774 Total Current Assets 112,236,708 125,315,558 Property, Plant and Equipment Land 824,344 824,344 Buildings 14,243,082 14,360,165 Machinery and equipment 45,202,670 40,928,380 Accumulated depreciation (31,980,335) (30,000,797)Property, Plant and Equipment, net 28,289,761 26,112,092 Other Assets Goodwill 70,776,893 70,777,459 Trademarks 5,514,960 5,514,886 Patents, technology and other intangibles net of accumulated amortization 15,325,927 18,819,897 Long term note receivable, less current portion 374,932 2,276,631 Deferred income taxes 2,283,571 488,989 Right of Use Assets 17,236,449 12,217,521 Total Other Assets 111,512,732 110,095,383 TOTAL ASSETS $252,039,201 $261,523,033 The Eastern CompanyConsolidated Balance Sheets (continued) December 30, December 31, 2023 2022 LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY Current Liabilities Accounts payable $25,319,473 $27,638,317 Accrued compensation 5,379,381 3,327,832 Other accrued expenses 4,556,623 3,944,964 Current portion of operating lease liability 4,424,369 3,059,547 Current portion of financing lease liability 182,010 - Current portion of long-term debt 2,871,870 9,010,793 Total Current Liabilities 42,733,726 46,981,453 Other long-term liabilities 640,724 754,762 Operating lease liability, less current portion 12,812,079 9,195,205 Financing lease liability, less current portion 728,100 - Long-term debt, less current portion 41,063,865 55,136,231 Accrued postretirement benefits 554,758 666,222 Accrued pension cost 21,025,365 22,174,465 Total Liabilities 119,558,617 134,908,338 Shareholders' Equity Voting Preferred Stock, no par value: Authorized and unissued: 1,000,000 shares Nonvoting Preferred Stock, no par value: Authorized and unissued: 1,000,000 shares Common Stock, no par value, Authorized: 50,000,000 shares Issued: 9,091,815 shares in 2023 and 9,056,421 shares in 2022 Outstanding: 6,217,370 shares in 2023 and 6,221,976 shares in 2022 33,950,859 33,586,165 Treasury Stock: 2,874,445 shares in 2023 and 2,834,445 shares in 2022 (23,280,467) (22,544,684)Retained earnings 144,805,168 138,985,852 Accumulated other comprehensive loss: Foreign currency translation (866,599) (1,140,978)Unrealized gain on interest rate swap, net of tax - 1,449,754 Unrecognized net pension and postretirement benefit costs, net of tax (22,128,377) (23,721,414)Accumulated other comprehensive loss (22,994,976) (23,412,638)Total Shareholders' Equity 132,480,584 126,614,695 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY $252,039,201 $261,523,033 See accompanying notes.

The company is working with external advisors to address these concerns and has filed a Form 12b-25 with the SEC for additional time to complete necessary tasks. Positive None. Negative Delayed release of financial results may impact investor confidence and lead to uncertainty in the market. Material weaknesses in internal controls could result in regulatory scrutiny and potential fines or penalties. Ongoing review of revenue recognition issues may uncover further discrepancies impacting financial statements for multiple periods. Financial Analyst The disclosure of revenue recognition issues by Luna Innovations Incorporated raises significant concern regarding the company's financial integrity and compliance with accounting standards. The announcement of potential material weaknesses in internal controls is a red flag for investors, as it directly impacts the reliability of financial statements. This situation could lead to revisions of past financial results and restatements, which typically result in stock price volatility. Investors should closely monitor the situation for any updates on the extent of the restatements and the company's plan to remediate the weaknesses.From a financial perspective, the delay in the filing of the annual report coupled with the need to re-evaluate previous quarters' revenues could suggest a more systemic issue within the company's financial practices. The market may react negatively to this uncertainty and there could be a period of underperformance until the company provides clarity and reassurance that corrective measures are effective. Legal Expert The filing of a Form 12b-25 indicates that Luna Innovations Incorporated is aware of its inability to meet the SEC's filing deadline, which is a procedural step to inform regulators and the public of the delay. The involvement of external legal advisors suggests that the company is taking the necessary steps to ensure that the review is thorough and that any legal implications are addressed. This situation could potentially lead to regulatory scrutiny or enforcement actions if the SEC deems the revenue recognition practices to have been intentionally misleading or if they significantly misrepresented the company's financial position.For stakeholders, it is crucial to understand that the company's proactive approach in announcing the review and its cooperation with the SEC may mitigate some legal risks. However, the legal ramifications could extend beyond SEC actions, including potential shareholder lawsuits if investors feel they have been misled. The duration and outcome of the review will be pivotal in determining the legal consequences for Luna Innovations Incorporated. Market Research Analyst The announcement by Luna Innovations Incorporated may have broader implications for the market, especially within the technology and fiber optics sectors. If the revenue recognition issues are indicative of aggressive accounting practices, it could lead to increased scrutiny of similar companies by investors and regulators, potentially affecting valuations across the sector. The market will be looking for trends in how these companies recognize revenue and manage their internal controls.Furthermore, this development could prompt a reassessment of risk for companies with complex customer arrangements that are vulnerable to misinterpretation under U.S. GAAP. It underscores the importance of robust financial governance and transparency in reporting practices. Competitors who maintain stringent controls and transparent practices may benefit from a flight to quality, as investors seek to minimize exposure to accounting-related risks. 03/12/2024 - 04:20 PM ROANOKE, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Luna Innovations Incorporated (NASDAQ: LUNA) (the “Company”), a global leader in advanced fiber optic-based technology, today announced it will delay the release of its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 financial results and the subsequent conference call. A Special Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors is conducting an independent review, with the assistance of external legal and financial advisors, of certain transactions for which revenue was recognized in the second and third quarters of 2023 that did not qualify for revenue recognition under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Special Committee is examining the circumstances surrounding these issues and is evaluating, among other things, the Company’s disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting and whether changes in accounting policies or other policies are necessary. The Company currently anticipates reporting material weaknesses in internal controls related to evaluating customer arrangements for proper revenue recognition and other controls and will be working to remediate these issues. The Company also announced it has filed a Form 12b-25, Notification of Late Filing, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the Company’s Annual Report on its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “Annual Report”), as additional time is needed to complete tasks and steps necessary to prepare and finalize the annual financial statements and other disclosures required to be included in the Annual Report, as well as to complete the ongoing review of recognition of revenue referenced above. There can be no assurance as to how long the review will take or when the Company will be able to complete the preparation and filing of the Annual Report. In addition, the review is ongoing, and the Company has not yet determined the full extent of the impact on the second and third quarters of 2023 and whether and to what extent there may be an impact on financial statements for any other periods. The Company is working diligently on this matter and will provide an update once more information is known.

Champions Oncology is facing economic challenges in the biotech sector but remains confident about future prospects. The company is actively seeking capital for its subsidiary, Corellia, AI, and progressing towards potential licensing deals. Strategic cost reductions are being implemented to improve short-term results. Loss from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $2.6 million with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.7 million. Total revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 decreased by 11.4% to $36.2 million compared to the same period last year. Champions ended the quarter with approximately $4.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt. Negative Revenue decline of 6% may impact investor confidence. Loss from operations and adjusted EBITDA loss indicate financial challenges. Reductions in costs may affect certain operational aspects of the business. Year-to-date revenue decline of 11.4% raises concerns about long-term growth. Ending the quarter with $4.5 million in cash may limit flexibility for future investments. Financial Analyst Champions Oncology's reported decline in third-quarter revenue and gross margin contraction reflects the company's struggle in a challenging biotech environment. The decrease in revenue by 5.9% year-over-year, coupled with a gross margin reduction from 39.7% to 34.7%, indicates pressure on profitability. This could be attributed to fixed costs remaining relatively unchanged while revenue decreased, highlighting a lack of scalability in the cost structure. Operational inefficiencies, as mentioned, also contributed to the margin squeeze.Adjusted EBITDA loss widening slightly from $1.6 million to $1.7 million suggests that operational improvements are not keeping pace with the revenue decline. The decrease in R&D expenses by 31.7% could be seen as a red flag for future growth prospects, as it may indicate a scaling back of investment in innovation. However, the management's statement about potential licensing deals in the pipeline could counterbalance this concern if those deals materialize.The company's net cash used in operating activities and the lack of financing activities in the third quarter highlight the need for capital efficiency and possibly signal a cautious approach to cash management, which is prudent given the current financial performance. Champions Oncology's cash position of $4.5 million with no debt provides some buffer, but the burn rate will be a key metric to watch in subsequent quarters. Market Research Analyst The biotechnology sector has faced economic headwinds and Champions Oncology's performance appears to be in line with broader industry trends of reduced study revenue and customer cancellations. The company's proactive engagement with investors for raising capital for its subsidiary, Corellia AI, indicates a strategic pivot towards leveraging artificial intelligence in oncology. This move could be pivotal in differentiating the company in a crowded marketplace and could potentially lead to new revenue streams.Strategic cost reductions mentioned by the CFO suggest that Champions Oncology is attempting to optimize its operations without sacrificing long-term growth potential. The market will likely monitor how these cost reductions impact the company's agility in responding to future opportunities. The accreditation of the laboratory by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) is a positive development, potentially enhancing the company's reputation and quality assurance in its services.The mention of operational inefficiencies leading to increased mouse costs and compensation expenses requires further scrutiny. It raises questions about the company's ability to manage variable costs, which could be a critical lever for improving margins in the future. Medical Research Analyst The reduction in R&D spending by Champions Oncology may reflect a strategic reallocation of resources or a response to the current economic climate. However, sustained R&D is crucial for long-term innovation and maintaining a competitive edge in the oncology research services market. The company's focus on its two lead targets and the potential for a licensing deal could be indicative of a more targeted and potentially lucrative R&D strategy, but it also represents a concentration of risk if those targets do not succeed.The CAP accreditation is a testament to the company's commitment to maintaining high laboratory standards, which is essential for ensuring the integrity of preclinical and clinical research data. This could enhance trust among existing and potential clients, potentially leading to more business opportunities.Overall, Champions Oncology's financial health and strategic decisions will need to be closely monitored, particularly their investment in R&D and the execution of their strategic initiatives, such as the development of Corellia AI and the pursuit of licensing deals. 03/12/2024 - 04:30 PM HACKENSACK, NJ / ACCESSWIRE / March 12, 2024 / Champions Oncology, Inc.

However, we still remain confident that the tide is turning and we will emerge stronger over the coming quarters."" Morris added, ""We remain actively engaged with investors in an effort to raise capital for our wholly owned subsidiary, Corellia, AI. Conjunctively, our two lead targets continue to progress with the potential of a licensing deal in the coming quarters.""David Miller, CFO of Champions, added, ""In response to our lower revenue growth, we're strategically right-sizing the business to reduce costs and improve short term results as we rebound to previous revenue levels. These reductions will not have a long-term impact on the business and we believe our quarterly results will gradually improve going forward.""Third Fiscal Quarter Financial ResultsTotal revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $12.0 million compared to $12.8 million for the same period last year, a decrease of 5.9%. The decline in revenue was primarily from customer cancellations in prior periods which led to lower study revenue in the third quarter. Total costs and operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were $14.6 million compared to $15.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, a decrease of $635,000 or 4.2%.For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, Champions reported a loss from operations of $2.6 million, including $379,000 in stock-based compensation and $481,000 in depreciation and amortization expenses, compared to a loss from operations of $2.5 million, inclusive of $331,000 in stock-based compensation and $575,000 in depreciation and amortization expenses, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.

The increase in cost of sales was primarily from an increase in compensation expense and mouse costs resulting from some operational inefficiencies. For the three-months ended January 31, 2024, total gross margin was 34.7% compared to 39.7% for the three-months ended January 31, 2023. The lower margin resulted primarily from a combination of a decline in revenue against relatively unchanged fixed costs and higher variable costs due to some operational inefficiencies.Research and development expense for the three-months ended January 31, 2024 was $2.2 million, a decrease of $1.0 million or 31.7%, compared to $3.2 million for the three-months ended January 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to reduced investment in our target discovery program. Sales and marketing expense for the three-months ended January 31, 2024 was $1.8 million, a slight increase of $36,000, or 2.0%, compared to $1.8 million for the three-months ended January 31, 2023. General and administrative expense for the three-months ended January 31, 2024 was $2.8 million, an increase of $195,000, or 7.6%, compared to $2.6 million for the three-months ended January 31, 2023. The increase was primarily from compensation and recruiting expenses and an increase in bad debt reserves.Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $920,000 for the three-months ended January 31, 2024 and was primarily due to our operational loss, offset by net changes in our working capital accounts and deferred revenue in in the ordinary course of business. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $125,000 for investment in additional lab and computer equipment. There were no financing activities for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024.Year-To-Date Financial ResultsFor the first nine months of fiscal 2024, revenue decreased 11.4% to $36.2 million compared to $40.8 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The decline in revenue was primarily from customer cancellations in fiscal year 2023 resulting in lower study revenue during fiscal year 2024. Total costs and operating expenses for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 were $43.2 million compared to $43.5 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2023, a decrease of $296,000 or 0.7%.For the first nine months of fiscal 2024, Champions reported a loss from operations of $7.1 million, including $855,000 in stock-based compensation and $1.4 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, compared to a loss from operations of $2.7 million, inclusive of $656,000 in stock-based compensation and $1.7 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Excluding stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expenses, Champions reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.8 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $400,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2023.Cost of oncology solutions was $22.2 million for the nine-months ended January 31, 2024, a slight decrease of $43,000, or 0.2% compared to $22.2 million for the nine-months ended January 31, 2023. For the nine-months ended January 31, 2024, total gross margin was 38.7% compared to 45.6% for the nine-months ended January 31, 2023. The lower margin resulted from lower revenue against a generally unchanged cost base. The variable cost component of cost of sales did not decline meaningfully despite the lower study volume due to some operational inefficiencies.Research and development expense for the nine-months ended January 31, 2024 was $7.5 million, a decrease of $1.2 million or 13.8%, compared to $8.7 million for the nine-months ended January 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily from reduced investment in our target discovery program. Sales and marketing expense for the nine-months ended January 31, 2024 was $5.3 million, a slight increase of $135,000, or 2.6%, compared to $5.2 million for the nine-months ended January 31, 2023. The increase was a result of an increase in compensation expense. General and administrative expense for the nine-months ended January 31, 2024 was $8.3 million, an increase of $811,000, or 10.8%, compared to $7.5 million for the nine-months ended January 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation and recruiting expenses and allowances for bad debt, offset by a reduction in IT costs.Net cash used in operating activities was $4.3 million for the nine-months ended January 31, 2024.

Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Certain unusual or non-recurring items that management does not believe affect the Company's basic operations do not meet the GAAP definition of unusual or non-recurring items.

The acquisition is expected to be accretive in 2025, with projected revenue for 2024 in the range of $145-155 million. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Alfamation by inTEST Corporation represents a strategic move to enhance inTEST's product offerings and market presence. The annual revenue of approximately $25 million from Alfamation contributes to inTEST's scale and offers deeper penetration in key markets such as automotive/EV and life sciences. This transaction is likely to influence investor perceptions positively, given the double-digit annual revenue growth reported by Alfamation, which suggests potential for strong future earnings.However, it's noteworthy that the acquisition is expected to be dilutive to earnings per diluted share in 2024, although accretive to non-GAAP adjusted earnings. This indicates short-term financial impact due to costs associated with the acquisition, such as the amortization of intangible assets, but a longer-term expectation of positive financial adjustments. Investors should consider the balance between immediate dilution and future accretion when evaluating the financial health and prospects of inTEST. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, inTEST's updated full year 2024 guidance with expected revenue in the range of $145 million to $155 million reflects the immediate impact of the Alfamation acquisition. The backlog of $15 million as of December 31, 2023, is a critical factor that provides visibility into Alfamation's future revenue stream and suggests a healthy order pipeline.The market will likely monitor the accretion expected in 2025 closely, as it will be a key indicator of the acquisition's success. It's important for stakeholders to understand the nuances of non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted earnings, to fully appreciate the underlying financial performance without the distortion of one-time costs or non-cash expenses like amortization. Industrial Analyst The integration of Alfamation into inTEST’s Electronic Test division is poised to strengthen their position in the automotive/EV and life science markets. Alfamation's Hyperion™, WALOT™ and Pixelshooter™ product lines are particularly relevant, given the increasing demand for sophisticated testing solutions in these sectors. The acquisition also strategically extends inTEST’s geographic reach, especially in Europe, which could lead to increased market share and customer base diversification.Understanding the significance of Alfamation's Flexmedia XM® within the automotive test and measurement industry is crucial, as it represents a competitive advantage in a market with high barriers to entry. The synergy between Alfamation's engineering expertise and inTEST's existing solutions could lead to enhanced product development and innovation, potentially resulting in long-term competitive gains. 03/12/2024 - 04:17 PM In line with the Company’s 5-Point Strategy, Alfamation augments inTEST’s automated test solutions and extends its geographic market reach Alfamation brings strong test equipment engineering and production capabilities for developing innovative test systems and solutions for electronics, micro-optics and optoelectronics manufacturing Designs and manufactures test solutions used for automotive infotainment, telematics and central control systems, as well as biometric monitoring equipment, mobile communications and wafer-level optical components Alfamation’s annual revenue of approximately $25 million increases inTEST’s scale while providing deeper penetration into key target markets Conference call to discuss acquisition scheduled for Wednesday, March 13 at 8:30 am ET MT. LAUREL, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- inTEST Corporation (NYSE American: INTT), a global supplier of innovative test and process technology solutions for use in manufacturing and testing in key target markets which include automotive/EV, defense/aerospace, industrial, life sciences, security, and semiconductor (“semi”), announced today that it has acquired Alfamation S.p.A. (“Alfamation”), a leading global provider of state-of-the-art test and measurement solutions for the automotive, life sciences and specialty consumer electronics markets. Terms of the acquisition are being filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Alfamation will become a part of the Electronic Test division within inTEST. Nick Grant, President and CEO, commented, “We identified the opportunity with Alfamation through our disciplined pursuit for acquisitions that will enhance our innovative test and process technology solutions and further strengthen our position in key target markets. We believe this acquisition is an excellent fit for our Electronic Test division and advances all dimensions of our 5-Point Strategy. Alfamation will deepen our presence in automotive/EV and life science markets, expand our exposure in consumer electronics, extend our geographic reach with a sizable footprint in Europe, and widen our portfolio of products and solutions. Additionally, Alfamation brings exceptional engineering talent and a strong management team that culturally aligns with inTEST’s mission to provide innovative, engineered solutions that address high-value challenges of our customers.” Alfamation was established in 1991. Headquartered in Milan, Italy, the business also has a small sales and service subsidiary based in Suzhou City, China. Alfamation designs, builds, and supports a wide range of products, from individual functional test modules to fully automated systems for production quality control and product development. Offerings include Alfamation's Hyperion™, a functional test platform that addresses a broad range of test requirements from wireless communication telematics through automotive infotainment and computer control units. Alfamation’s range of automated test solutions also includes wafer-level optical component testers (WALOT™) and fully automated display and instrument cluster testers with integrated robotics for haptic and touch test functionality (Pixelshooter™). Alfamation is well known in the automotive test and measurement industry for Flexmedia XM®, its family of specialty test tools. This is a modular, robust and cost-effective solution for building flexible, scalable, functional testers for applications that include audio and video generators and analyzers, automotive ethernet and communication interfaces, and analog measurements. At current exchange rates, Alfamation’s annual revenue in 2023 was approximately $25 million and had backlog at December 31, 2023 of approximately $15 million. The Company expects the acquisition to be accretive in 2025. Alfamation has generated healthy, double-digit, annual revenue growth over the last few years. Updating Full Year 2024 Guidance As a result of the acquisition, revenue for full year 2024 is expected to be in the range of $145 million to $155 million. The acquisition is expected to be dilutive to earnings per diluted share in 2024, but accretive to non-GAAP adjusted earnings per diluted share(1) due to the anticipated impacts associated with the amortization of intangible assets. Given the timing of the acquisition, the impact to first quarter 2024 results from operations are expected to be nominal.

Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures This release includes certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share. Forward-looking adjusted earnings per diluted share is derived by dividing estimated adjusted net earnings by estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. We have provided these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures because management uses such measures to make operational decisions, to forecast future operational results, and for comparison with our business plan, historical operating results and the operating results of our peers. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures of earnings. The Company has not quantified forward-looking adjusted earnings per diluted share or provided a reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures because the Company cannot do so without unreasonable efforts. Key Performance Indicators Management uses backlog as a key performance metric to analyze and measure the Company’s financial performance and results of operations. Management uses backlog as a measure of current and future business and financial performance, and it may not be comparable with measures provided by other companies. Backlog is calculated on the basis of firm purchase orders we receive for which revenue has not yet been recognized. Management believes tracking backlog is useful as it often times is a leading indicator of future performance. In accordance with industry practice, contracts may include provisions for cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the customer. Given that backlog is an operational measure and that the Company's methodology for calculating backlog does not meet the definition of a non-GAAP measure, as that term is defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a quantitative reconciliation for backlog is not required or provided. Forward-Looking Statements This press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. These statements do not convey historical information but relate to predicted or potential future events and financial results, such as statements of the Company’s plans, strategies and intentions, or our future performance or goals, that are based upon management's current expectations. These forward-looking statements can often be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “believe,” “expects,” “further,” “expand,” “extend,” “widen,” “will,” “plan,” “potential,” “anticipates,” “target,” or similar terminology. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, any mentioned in this press release as well as the Company’s ability to execute on its 5-Point Strategy, realize the potential benefits of acquisitions and successfully integrate any acquired operations, including the operations of Alfamation, grow the Company’s presence in its key target and international markets, manage supply chain challenges, convert backlog to sales and to ship product in a timely manner; the success of the Company’s strategy to diversify its markets; the impact of inflation on the Company’s business and financial condition; indications of a change in the market cycles in the semi market or other markets served; changes in business conditions and general economic conditions both domestically and globally including rising interest rates and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates; changes in the demand for semiconductors; access to capital and the ability to borrow funds or raise capital to finance potential acquisitions or for working capital; changes in the rates and timing of capital expenditures by the Company’s customers; and other risk factors set forth from time to time in the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including, but not limited to, the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Any forward-looking statement made by the Company in this press release is based only on information currently available to management and speaks to circumstances only as of the date on which it is made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update the information in this press release to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events, except as required by law. 1 Estimated adjusted earnings per diluted share is a forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure.

The company also leads in pension group annuity sales with $10.4 billion, showcasing its market dominance and commitment to providing retirement solutions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Athene USA topping LIMRA's 2023 U.S. Retail Annuity Survey is a significant indicator of the company's market position and operational performance. With a record $35 billion in total annuity sales, Athene has demonstrated a robust growth trajectory in the retirement savings products sector. This performance likely translates to increased revenue streams and profitability, which are key drivers of shareholder value. Furthermore, the company's leading position in pension group annuity sales, with $10.4 billion in total volume, underscores its competitive advantage in the pension risk transfer market. Investors should consider the implications of this market leadership on Athene's financial stability and its ability to capitalize on the demographic trend of an aging population, which could result in sustained demand for its retirement solutions. Market Research Analyst Understanding the context of Athene's achievements requires a closer look at the broader annuities market and consumer trends. The fact that over 11,000 Americans are turning 65 every day highlights the growing target demographic for retirement products. Athene's strategic focus on expanding distribution and offering products that provide principal protection and guaranteed income aligns with the increasing consumer demand for financial security in retirement. This strategic alignment may not only enhance Athene's market share but could also set a precedent for product innovation and distribution strategies within the industry. The company's performance and strategic direction could influence other market players, potentially leading to increased competition and product diversification in the annuities space. Economist From an economic perspective, Athene's record sales in annuities and pension group annuities reflect broader economic trends, such as the shift towards defined contribution plans and the increasing need for private retirement funding solutions. As public pension systems face sustainability challenges, the role of private sector players like Athene becomes more pronounced. This shift represents a reallocation of risk from employers and the public sector to individuals and private entities, which in turn impacts how retirement risks are managed and priced in the economy. The success of Athene's pension risk transfer business suggests a growing reliance on private market solutions to manage pension liabilities, with potential long-term implications for the retirement system's stability and the financial well-being of retirees. 03/12/2024 - 04:30 PM WEST DES MOINES, Iowa, March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Athene USA (“Athene”), a leading provider of retirement savings products, ranked number one in total annuity sales in LIMRA’s 2023 U.S. Retail Annuity Survey, with a record $35 billion.

Announces Public Offering of Ordinary Shares Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Ichor Holdings, Ltd. (ICHR) has announced a $125 million underwritten public offering of its ordinary shares. The company plans to use the proceeds for debt repayment, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, growth opportunities, and strategic transactions. TD Cowen and Stifel are the joint book-running managers for the offering. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst With Ichor Holdings, Ltd. initiating a public offering of $125 million in ordinary shares, there is a clear indication of the company's strategy to strengthen its financial position. The decision to offer additional shares to repay outstanding debt and for general corporate purposes suggests a proactive approach to managing the company's capital structure. Such a move typically aims to reduce interest expenses and improve the balance sheet, potentially leading to an enhanced credit profile.The offering also hints at possible future expansions or acquisitions, as the company has mentioned the use of proceeds for capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, growth opportunities and strategic transactions. This could indicate that Ichor Holdings is positioning itself for growth in the semiconductor capital equipment industry, which is known for its cyclicality and competitive landscape. Investors might view this as a positive step towards long-term value creation, provided that the company invests wisely in opportunities that align with its core competencies and market trends.However, the dilutive effect of the new shares on existing shareholders cannot be ignored. The immediate impact could be a decrease in earnings per share, which might affect the stock price negatively in the short term. It's crucial for investors to monitor the final terms of the offering, disclosed in the final prospectus supplement, to understand the full implications of the offering on their investment. Market Research Analyst The semiconductor industry is characterized by high capital intensity and rapid technological advancements. Ichor Holdings' move to secure additional capital through a public offering could be a strategic maneuver to stay competitive in this dynamic environment. The intended use of the proceeds for capital expenditures may signal the company's commitment to investing in state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities and innovation.Moreover, the involvement of established financial institutions like TD Cowen and Stifel as joint book-running managers, along with other co-managers, lends credibility to the offering and might attract institutional investors seeking exposure to the semiconductor sector. This could potentially increase trading volumes and liquidity for Ichor Holdings' shares, which is generally favorable from a market perspective.It's also worth noting that the semiconductor industry is benefiting from trends such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G technology, which drive demand for advanced semiconductor components. If Ichor Holdings leverages the raised capital to tap into these growth areas, it could see substantial returns on investment over the long term. However, investors should be aware of the inherent risks associated with the sector, including cyclical demand patterns and intense competition. Legal Expert The offering is being conducted under an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which allows for a more streamlined process and quicker access to the market. The use of a shelf registration is common for companies that meet certain regulatory criteria, offering them flexibility in timing the market for capital raising activities. The fact that Ichor Holdings has filed a preliminary prospectus supplement with the SEC provides transparency to investors, allowing them to make informed decisions based on the latest information about the company's financial health and strategic direction.It is important for potential investors to review the prospectus supplement and accompanying base prospectus carefully to understand the risks involved. Legal disclosures regarding investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses are not only regulatory requirements but also essential for assessing the potential impact of the investment on one's portfolio. The final terms of the offering, once filed, will provide definitive details that are crucial for evaluating the offering's suitability for individual investment strategies. 03/12/2024 - 04:20 PM FREMONT, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ichor Holdings, Ltd.

Financial Analyst The declaration of an extraordinary cash dividend by International General Insurance Holdings Ltd. (IGI) represents a significant return of capital to shareholders, which can be perceived as a strong signal of financial health and confidence from the company's management. Typically, extraordinary dividends are not common and are often a result of excess cash on the company's balance sheet, which management has decided to distribute to shareholders rather than reinvesting in the business. This can lead to a positive reaction in the stock market, as investors may interpret the dividend as a sign of strong earnings and a solid balance sheet.However, it's important to assess the sustainability of such dividends. A one-time dividend may not necessarily indicate a long-term trend and investors should consider the company's future earnings potential and any potential impact on its growth strategy. An extraordinary dividend could also suggest that the company lacks profitable reinvestment opportunities, which might be a concern for long-term growth prospects. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the timing and size of the dividend can influence investor sentiment and stock performance. The market often reacts favorably to dividend announcements, especially when they exceed expectations. In the case of IGI, an extraordinary dividend of $0.50 per share is substantial when compared to the regular quarterly dividend of $0.01 per share. This could attract income-focused investors and potentially increase the stock's liquidity.It is also essential to evaluate the industry context. If IGI's dividend payout is significantly higher than its peers', it could place the company in a favorable position among competitors. However, if such payouts are common in the industry, the impact might be muted. Additionally, the market will monitor how the dividend payment affects IGI's financial ratios, such as the payout ratio and debt levels, which are critical indicators of financial stability. Economist An extraordinary dividend can have broader economic implications. It can be reflective of the macroeconomic environment, where a low-interest-rate climate might make holding large cash reserves less attractive for companies, prompting them to return cash to shareholders instead. For the economy, this can mean more cash in circulation, potentially stimulating spending and investment on the part of shareholders.However, it's also important to consider the opportunity cost of such dividends. The funds used for the extraordinary dividend could have been deployed towards corporate growth or strategic investments. The decision to pay out this capital may indicate management's stance on the current economic landscape and their assessment of the risk-reward profile of potential investments. 03/12/2024 - 04:15 PM HAMILTON, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- International General Insurance Holdings Ltd. (“IGI” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IGIC) today announced that its Board of Directors has declared an extraordinary cash dividend of $0.50 per common share for the period October 1, 2023 – December 31, 2023, in addition to the Company’s regular quarterly common share dividend of $0.01 per share. The extraordinary dividend plus the regular quarterly dividend, totaling $0.51, is payable on April 22, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 1, 2024.

Quarterly dividend increased by 33% despite challenges in natural gas pricing. Negative Decrease in total production volumes by 3% for the full fiscal year. Net income of $2.5 million for the fiscal fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA of $4.5 million for the fiscal fourth quarter. Financial Analyst PHX Minerals Inc. reported a year-over-year increase in net income for the fiscal fourth quarter, while experiencing a decrease for the full fiscal year. The company's successful expansion in royalty volumes by 23% and reserve growth of 9% indicates a strategic focus on high-quality mineral acquisitions, particularly in the Haynesville and SCOOP plays. The increase in net proved royalty interest reserves is a positive indicator of the company's asset quality and future production potential.The company's declaration of a higher quarterly dividend despite a challenging natural gas pricing environment showcases a strong balance sheet and a strategy of modest leverage. This financial prudence is crucial in an industry characterized by price volatility. The debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.45x is within a reasonable range, suggesting that the company maintains a manageable level of debt relative to its earnings.However, the decrease in total revenue and natural gas, oil and NGL sales raises concerns about the impact of commodity price fluctuations on the company's top-line growth. The reduction in working interest sales also reflects a strategic shift away from direct operational involvement towards a royalty-based income model which may reduce exposure to operational risks and capital expenditure requirements. Market Research Analyst The reported decrease in natural gas, oil and NGL prices, coupled with a decrease in oil volumes sold, indicates broader market challenges that could affect investor sentiment towards the energy sector. The company's hedging strategy, which resulted in a net gain on derivative contracts, demonstrates an effective risk management approach that can protect against price volatility. The hedging percentages suggest a balanced approach, shielding a portion of the revenue from price swings while still allowing for upside potential.PHX Minerals' focus on acquiring high-quality minerals aligns with industry trends emphasizing the importance of asset quality over quantity. The strategic shift towards royalty interests, as opposed to working interests, may attract investors seeking lower risk profiles. The company's operational outlook for 2024, with projected stable mineral and royalty production, provides a clear expectation for investors and could be seen as a stabilizing factor for the stock. Energy Sector Analyst The increase in royalty production volumes and the conversion of wells to producing status reflect PHX Minerals' operational efficiency and effective capital deployment. The company's optimism about the balance of the market and improvement in commodity prices due to reduced drilling activity and the expansion of LNG export facilities is shared by other industry players who anticipate a tightening of supply-demand dynamics.The company's investment of over $30 million in mineral acquisitions and the subsequent increase in royalty interest reserves underscore a strategic growth focus. This is particularly relevant in the context of the energy transition where natural gas plays a critical role as a bridge fuel. PHX Minerals' positioning in plays like the Haynesville Shale, which is known for its high-quality assets and proximity to growing LNG export markets, could provide a competitive advantage as global energy dynamics evolve. 03/12/2024 - 04:15 PM FORT WORTH, Texas, March 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- PHX MINERALS INC., ""PHX"" or the ""Company"" (NYSE: PHX), today reported financial and operating results for the quarter and fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2023.

Stephens, President and CEO, commented, ""In 2023, PHX delivered year-over-year royalty volume growth of 23%, expanding 2P royalty reserves by 12%, generating significant operating cash flow and net income. These results enabled us to raise our quarterly dividend by 33% despite another challenging year in the natural gas pricing environment. Our strong balance sheet and strategy of modest leverage enabled us to deliver consistent results despite a historic drop in gas prices and rising interest rates validating our business strategy, which positions us for success in both up and down markets."" ""Looking forward, we are optimistic that reduced drilling activity, announced production curtailments, and the expansion of LNG export facilities should balance the market and improve commodity prices,"" continued Mr. Stephens. ""During the past year, PHX deployed more than $30 million to acquire almost 2,400 net royalty acres in the Haynesville and SCOOP plays. The acquisition of these high-quality minerals will further drive our royalty volumes, margin expansion and cash flow over the course of the next two to three years. With our strong financial position and a highly focused acquisition strategy we are poised to unlock value for our shareholders as the commodity pricing environment improves.""

The change in net income was principally the result of a decrease in natural gas, oil and NGL sales, a decrease in gains on asset sales, and an increase in DD&A, partially offset by decreases in impairment, lease operating expenses, and transportation, gathering and marketing expenses. Natural gas, oil and NGL revenue decreased $6.3 million, or 43%, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, compared to the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2022, due to decreases in natural gas, oil and NGL prices of 55%, 5% and 17%, respectively, and a decrease in oil volumes of 24%, partially offset by an increase in natural gas volumes of 6%. The increase in royalty production volumes during the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023 to 1,946 Mmcfe from 1,628 Mmcfe during the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2022 resulted from new wells in the Haynesville Shale and SCOOP coming online. The production decrease in working interest volumes during the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, as compared to the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2022, resulted from the divestiture of working interest properties in the Arkoma Stack and Eagle Ford Shale plays. The Company had a net gain on derivative contracts of $3.2 million for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, comprised of a $2.9 million non-cash gain on derivatives and a $0.3 million gain on settled derivatives, as compared to a net gain of $3.3 million for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2022. The change in net gain on derivative contracts was due to the Company's settlements of natural gas and oil collars and fixed price swaps and the change in valuation caused by the difference in Dec. 31, 2023 pricing relative to the strike price on open derivative contracts. The Company recorded no impairment and made immaterial divestitures during the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023. Lease operating expenses and transportation, gathering and marketing expenses were lower due to the divestiture of working interest properties in the Arkoma Stack and Eagle Ford Shale plays. Twelve Months Ended Dec. 31, 2023 Results The Company recorded net income of $13.9 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2023, as compared to net income of $17.1 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2022. The change in net income was principally the result of a decrease in natural gas, oil and NGL sales and a decrease in gains on asset sales, partially offset by an increase in gains associated with our derivative contracts and decreases in impairment, lease operating expenses, production and ad valorem taxes, and transportation, gathering and marketing expenses. Natural gas, oil and NGL revenue decreased $34.5 million, or 49%, for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2023, compared to the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2022, due to decreases in natural gas, oil and NGL prices of 58%, 18% and 37%, respectively, and decreases in natural gas, oil and NGL volumes of 1%, 10% and 14%, respectively. The increase in royalty production volumes during the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2023 to 8,123 Mmcfe from 6,613 Mmcfe during the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2022 resulted from new wells in the Haynesville Shale and SCOOP coming online. The production decrease in working interest volumes during the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2023, as compared to the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2022, resulted from the divestiture of working interest properties in the Fayetteville Shale, Arkoma Stack, and Eagle Ford Shale plays. The Company had a net gain on derivative contracts of $6.9 million for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2023, comprised of a a $4.3 million non-cash gain on derivatives and a $2.6 million gain on settled derivatives, as compared to a net loss of ($16.3) million for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2022. The gain on settled derivative contracts for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2023 excludes $0.4 million of cash paid to settle off-market derivative contracts. The total net cash received to settle hedge contracts during the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2023 was $2.2 million. The change in net gain on derivative contracts was due to the Company's settlements of natural gas and oil collars and fixed price swaps and the change in valuation caused by the difference in Dec. 31, 2023 pricing relative to the strike price on open derivative contracts. Lease operating expenses and transportation, gathering and marketing expenses were lower due to the divestiture of working interest properties in the Fayetteville Shale, Arkoma Stack, and Eagle Ford Shale plays. Production and ad valorem taxes decreased due to a 49% decrease in natural gas, oil and NGL sales. Operations Update During the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, the Company converted 46 gross (0.098 net) wells to producing status, including 21 gross (0.044 net) wells in the Haynesville and 14 gross (0.024 net) wells in the SCOOP, compared to 60 gross (0.27 net) wells in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2022.

These non-GAAP financial measures are calculated using GAAP amounts in the Company's financial statements. These measures, detailed below, are provided in addition to, not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in the Company's financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes thereto), included in the Company's SEC filings and posted on its website. Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation The Company defines ""adjusted EBITDA"" as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, excluding non-cash gains (losses) on derivatives and gains (losses) on asset sales and including cash receipts from (payments on) off-market derivatives and restricted stock and deferred directors' expense. The Company has included a presentation of adjusted EBITDA because it recognizes that certain investors consider this amount to be a useful means of measuring the Company's ability to meet its debt service obligations and evaluating its financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flow from operations or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of other companies. The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA for the quarters indicated: Three Months Ended Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Three Months Ended Dec. 31, 2023 Dec. 31, 2022 Dec. 31, 2023 Dec. 31, 2022 Sept. 30, 2023 Net Income $ 2,513,444 $ 3,346,133 $ 13,920,800 $ 17,073,156 $ 1,895,403 Plus: Income tax expense 1,245,460 981,000 4,735,460 4,421,000 589,000 Interest expense 723,685 637,698 2,362,393 1,625,971 556,941 DD&A 2,443,154 1,802,114 8,566,185 7,496,472 2,022,709 Impairment expense - 6,100,696 38,533 6,109,676 36,460 Less: Non-cash gains (losses) on derivatives 2,936,659 6,265,041 4,302,531 (584,976) (940,592) Gains (losses) on asset sales 57,505 934,207 4,728,759 7,478,781 243,041 Plus: Cash receipts from (payments on) off-market derivative contracts(1) - (903,461) (373,745) (5,738,164) - Restricted stock and deferred director's expense 572,709 569,084 2,433,927 2,649,194 522,965 Adjusted EBITDA $ 4,504,288 $ 5,334,016 $ 22,652,263 $ 26,743,500 $ 6,321,029 (1) The initial receipt of $8.8 million of cash from BP Energy Company, or BP, for entering into the off-market derivative contracts had no effect on the Company's statement of operations and was considered cash flow from financing activities.

Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (TTM) Reconciliation ""Debt to adjusted EBITDA (TTM)"" is defined as the ratio of long-term debt to adjusted EBITDA on a trailing 12-month (TTM) basis. The Company has included a presentation of debt to adjusted EBITDA (TTM) because it recognizes that certain investors consider such ratios to be a useful means of measuring the Company's ability to meet its debt service obligations and for evaluating its financial performance. The debt to adjusted EBITDA (TTM) ratio has limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flow from operations or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of debt to adjusted EBITDA (TTM) may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of other companies.

Operating expenses decreased by 15%, with an additional $30 million in expense reductions announced. The company completed a $200 million ABS deal in February at lower pricing compared to a previous transaction. Full Year 2024 guidance anticipates improved profitability. Positive Total revenue for Oportun Financial Corporation in Q4 2023 was $263 million, contributing to a total of $1.1 billion for the full year 2023, marking an 11% growth compared to the previous year. Operating expenses saw a 15% decrease in the fourth quarter, and the company announced an additional $30 million in operating expense reductions. Oportun completed a $200 million asset-backed securitization deal in February, achieving pricing 160 bps lower than a transaction in October. Full Year 2024 guidance indicates expectations for significantly improved profitability for Oportun. Adjusted EBITDA for the company was $6.1 million in Q4 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial metrics from Oportun Financial Corporation indicate a robust performance in terms of revenue growth, with an 11% year-over-year increase. This growth trajectory is commendable in the current economic climate and suggests that the company has successfully navigated market challenges. The decrease in quarterly operating expenses by 15% is a strong indicator of effective cost management strategies being implemented, which is crucial for improving profitability.However, the net income figures present a significant loss, which raises concerns about the company's bottom line despite top-line growth. This could be attributed to one-time charges or underlying issues that need to be addressed. The announced $30 million in operating expense reductions further signals a strategic shift towards cost optimization, which could be beneficial for long-term profitability but may also have implications for the company's operational capabilities.The $200 million asset-backed securitization deal completed at a substantially lower pricing than the previous transaction reflects positively on investor confidence and the company's creditworthiness. This financial maneuver not only provides immediate capital but also reduces interest expenses, contributing to future earnings potential. Market Research Analyst Oportun's focus on three differentiated core products—unsecured personal loans, secured personal loans and savings—suggests a strategic pivot to diversify and strengthen its portfolio. This approach could mitigate risks associated with market fluctuations and consumer credit behavior. The emphasis on quality of originations under a tightened credit posture indicates a prudent risk management strategy, which is crucial in maintaining a healthy loan book, especially in uncertain economic times.The full year 2024 guidance projecting markedly improved profitability is a positive signal to the market, indicating management's confidence in the company's strategic direction. However, investors should closely monitor the execution of the cost reduction plans and their impact on the company's growth prospects and service quality. Economist The financial results from Oportun Financial Corporation must be contextualized within the broader economic environment. The company's performance, particularly the revenue increase in a period of potential economic tightening, indicates resilience in the consumer finance sector. The asset-backed securitization deal's success at lower pricing points to a favorable debt market condition for quality borrowers, which could have broader implications for the credit market.Yet, the substantial net losses reported may reflect broader economic pressures such as increased default rates or competitive dynamics impacting profitability. The forward-looking statements about improved profitability in 2024 suggest that the company anticipates a favorable shift in these conditions or the realization of significant efficiencies from their cost reduction strategies. Stakeholders should consider these factors when assessing the company's future performance in the context of potential economic headwinds. 03/12/2024 - 04:15 PM 4Q23 Total revenue of $263 million, bringing FY23 to $1.1 billion, up 11% year-over-year Quarterly operating expense down 15% $30 million in additional operating expense reductions announced $200 million February ABS deal completed at 160 bps lower pricing than October transaction Full Year 2024 guidance reflects expectations for markedly improved profitability SAN CARLOS, Calif., March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oportun Financial Corporation (Nasdaq: OPRT) (“Oportun”, or the ""Company"") today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. ""We executed well during the fourth quarter and met each of our guidance metrics,"" said Raul Vazquez, CEO of Oportun. ""Our top-line remained resilient and we completed full year 2023 with a record $1.1 billion of total revenue, for 11% growth year-over-year, while continuing to focus on the quality rather than the quantity of our originations under a tightened credit posture. We also continued to drive operating efficiencies and reduced our quarterly operating expenses by 15% year-over-year, setting our sixth consecutive post-IPO record for Adjusted Operating Efficiency. We're pleased that the $200 million asset backed securitization we completed in February was ten times oversubscribed, indicative of the investment community's strong confidence in the quality of Oportun's underwriting and its business model. Committed to enhancing our profitability while serving our members as a much leaner enterprise, we're ardently focused on winning in the marketplace with three differentiated core products: unsecured personal loans, secured personal loans and savings. Our initial full year 2024 guidance reflects markedly improved profitability on an adjusted basis, supported by an additional $30 million in run-rate operating expense savings to be achieved by 4Q24.""

Operational Drivers Members – Members as of the end of the fourth quarter grew to 2.2 million, up 18% from 1.9 million at the end of the prior-year quarter. Products – Products as of the end of the fourth quarter grew to 2.4 million, up 19% from 2.0 million at the end of the prior-year quarter. Originations – Aggregate Originations for the fourth quarter were $437 million, a decrease of 28% as compared to $610 million in the prior-year quarter. Aggregate Originations for the full year 2023 were $1.8 billion, a decrease of 38% as compared to $2.9 billion in 2022. The decrease is primarily due to credit tightening actions. The decrease in number of loans originated was partially offset by growth in average loan size due to a focus on returning members. Portfolio Yield – Portfolio Yield as of the end of fourth quarter was 32.7%, an increase of 100 basis points as compared to 31.7% in the prior-year quarter. Portfolio Yield for the full year 2023 was 32.2%, an increase of 23 basis points as compared to 32.0% in 2022. Both figures were primarily attributable to higher pricing on our personal loan products. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Revenue – Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $263 million, essentially flat as compared to total revenue of $262 million in the prior-year quarter. Total revenue was flat as increased portfolio yield and higher non-interest income was offset by a decrease in the Average Daily Principal Balance. Net Revenue for the fourth quarter was $72 million, a decrease of 50% as compared to Net Revenue of $143 million in the prior-year quarter. Net Revenue declined from the prior-year quarter due to an unfavorable change in fair value and increased interest expense, partially offset by improved net charge-offs. Operating Expenses and Adjusted Operating Expenses – For the fourth quarter, total operating expense was $129 million including $7 million of costs related to severance, a decrease of 15% as compared to $151 million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted Operating Expense, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and certain non-recurring charges, decreased 27% year-over-year to $101 million. Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) – Net loss was $41.8 million, as compared to net loss of $8.4 million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted Net Loss was $21 million, as compared to Adjusted Net Income of $4.6 million in the prior-year quarter. The decreases in net income and Adjusted Net Income are attributable to an unfavorable net change in fair value, and increased interest expense. Earnings (Loss) Per Share and Adjusted EPS – GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted, were both $1.09 , as compared to basic and diluted loss per share of $0.25 each in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted loss per share was $0.54 as compared to adjusted earnings per share of $0.14 in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA – Adjusted EBITDA was $6.1 million, up $40 million from the prior year quarter, driven by a significant reduction in operating expenses. Full Year 2023 Financial Results Revenue – Total revenue for the full year was $1.1 billion, an increase of 11% as compared to total revenue of $953 million in 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased interest income attributable to a higher Average Daily Principal Balance and increased non-interest income attributable to interest earned on our savings product, recently rebranded as ""Set & Save."" Operating Expenses and Adjusted Operating Expenses – For the full year, total operating expense was $534 million, a decrease of 25% as compared to $716 million in 2022. Adjusted Operating Expense, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and certain non-recurring charges, decreased 17% year-over-year to $452 million, primarily driven by the Company's reductions in force, decreased marketing spend as we shifted our strategy to focus efforts on existing and returning members and other cost savings measures. Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) – Net loss was $180 million, as compared to a net loss of $78 million in 2022. Adjusted Net Loss was $124 million, as compared to Adjusted Net Income of $69 million in 2022. The decreases in net income and Adjusted Net Income are attributable to non-cash fair value mark-to-market adjustments, increased charge-offs and interest expense, partially offset by increased revenues. Earnings (Loss) Per Share and Adjusted EPS – GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted, were both $4.88 for the full year 2023 as compared to basic and diluted loss per share of $2.37 each in 2022.

Oportun Financial CorporationABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES(unaudited) This press release dated March 12, 2024 contains non-GAAP financial measures. The following tables reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in this press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that the provision of these non-GAAP financial measures can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of Oportun's core business and useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results. However, non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income, adjusted to eliminate the effect of certain items as described below. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure because it allows management, investors and its board of directors to evaluate and compare operating results, including return on capital and operating efficiencies, from period to period by making the adjustments described below. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of Oportun's business, as it removes the effect of income taxes, certain non-cash items, variable charges and timing differences. The Company believes it is useful to exclude the impact of income tax expense, as reported, because historically it has included irregular income tax items that do not reflect ongoing business operations.The Company believes it is useful to exclude depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense because they are non-cash charges.The Company believes it is useful to exclude the impact of interest expense associated with the Company's corporate financing facilities, as it views this expense as related to its capital structure rather than its funding.The Company excludes the impact of certain non-recurring charges, such as expenses associated with our workforce optimization, acquisition and integration related expenses and other non-recurring charges because it does not believe that these items reflect ongoing business operations. Other non-recurring charges include litigation reserve, impairment charges, debt amendment and warrant amortization costs related to our corporate financing facilities.The Company also reverses origination fees for Loans Receivable at Fair Value, net. The Company believes it is beneficial to exclude the uncollected portion of such origination fees, because such amounts do not represent cash received.The Company also reverses the fair value mark-to-market adjustment because it is a non-cash adjustment. Revised Adjusted EBITDA Beginning in 2024, we will transition to an updated definition of Adjusted EBITDA which better represents how management views the results of operations and makes management decisions. Reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures, updated definitions of reconciling items, and comparative calculations for 2022 and 2023 for Adjusted EBITDA using the new definition can be found below. Adjusted EBITDARationale for ChangeInterest on Corporate FinancingWe have updated the interest on corporate financing adjustment to include interest on our acquisition related financing previously included within the adjustment for acquisition and integration related expenses.Depreciation and amortizationWe have updated the adjustment related to depreciation and amortization to include the amortization of acquired intangibles. This amortization was previously included within the adjustment for acquisition and integration related expenses.Acquisition and integration related expensesWe have removed the adjustment related to acquisition and integration related expenses. Interest expense related to our acquisition related financing has been reclassified to the adjustment for corporate financing. Amortization of acquired intangibles has been reclassified to depreciation and amortization.Origination fees for loans receivable at fair value, netWe have removed the adjustment related to origination fees for loans receivable at fair value, net as we believe this better aligns with common practices within our industry. Adjusted Net IncomeThe Company defines Adjusted Net Income as net income adjusted to eliminate the effect of certain items as described below. The Company believes that Adjusted Net Income is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management, investors, and the Company's board of directors to evaluate and compare its operating results, including return on capital and operating efficiencies, from period to period, excluding the after-tax impact of non-cash, stock-based compensation expense and certain non-recurring charges. The Company believes it is useful to exclude the impact of income tax expense (benefit), as reported, because historically it has included irregular income tax items that do not reflect ongoing business operations. The Company also includes the impact of normalized income tax expense by applying a normalized statutory tax rate.The Company believes it is useful to exclude the impact of certain non-recurring charges, such as expenses associated with our workforce optimization, acquisition and integration related expenses and other non-recurring charges because it does not believe that these items reflect its ongoing business operations. Other non-recurring charges include litigation reserve, impairment charges, debt amendment and warrant amortization costs related to our Corporate Financing facility.The Company believes it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation expense because it is a non-cash charge. Revised Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Beginning in 2024, we will transition to an updated definition of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) which better represents how management views the results of operations and makes management decisions. Reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures, updated definitions of reconciling items, and comparative calculations for 2022 and 2023 for Adjusted Net Income (Loss) using the new definitions can be found below. Adjusted Net Income (Loss)Rationale for ChangeAcquisition and integration related expensesWe have removed the adjustment related to acquisition and integration related expenses. Interest expense related to our acquisition related financing has been reclassified to the adjustment for Corporate Financing. Amortization of acquired intangibles has been reclassified to depreciation and amortization.Fair value mark-to-market adjustment on Asset-Backed Notes at Fair ValueWe have added an adjustment to exclude the Fair value mark-to-market adjustments related to Asset-Backed Notes at Fair Value. This adjustment aligns with our decision in 2023 to stop electing the fair value option for new debt financings. By the end of 2025 nearly all our existing Asset-Backed Notes at Fair Value will have paid down to zero, so after that there will be no mark-to-market adjustment for our debt. Adjusted Operating Efficiency and Adjusted Operating ExpenseThe Company defines Adjusted Operating Efficiency as Adjusted Operating Expense divided by total revenue. The Company defines Adjusted Operating Expense as total operating expenses adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense and certain non-recurring charges, such as expenses associated with our workforce optimization, acquisition and integration related expenses and other non-recurring charges. Other non-recurring charges include litigation reserve, impairment charges, and debt amendment costs related to our Corporate Financing facility. The Company believes Adjusted Operating Efficiency is an important measure because it allows management, investors and Oportun's board of directors to evaluate how efficiently the Company is managing costs relative to revenue. The Company believes Adjusted Operating Expense is an important measure because it allows management, investors and Oportun's board of directors to evaluate and compare its operating costs from period to period, excluding the impact of non-cash, stock-based compensation expense and certain non-recurring charges. Adjusted Return on EquityThe Company defines Adjusted Return on Equity (“ROE”) as annualized Adjusted Net Income divided by average stockholders’ equity. Average stockholders’ equity is an average of the beginning and ending stockholders’ equity balance for each period. The Company believes Adjusted ROE is an important measure because it allows management, investors and its board of directors to evaluate the profitability of the business in relation to its stockholders' equity and how efficiently it generates income from stockholders' equity. Adjusted EPSThe Company defines Adjusted EPS as Adjusted Net Income divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding.

U.S. Bancorp announces quarterly dividends,2024-03-12T20:47:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) announces regular quarterly dividends for common and preferred stockholders, with a total annual dividend of $1.96 per common share.","U.S. Bancorp announces quarterly dividends Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) announces regular quarterly dividends for common and preferred stockholders, with a total annual dividend of $1.96 per common share. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of U.S. Bancorp's regular quarterly dividend is a substantive piece of information for current and potential investors. The dividend of $0.49 per common share signals the company's current profitability and its ability to generate cash flow, which is a strong indicator of financial health. Moreover, the consistency of the dividend payments suggests a stable financial position and a commitment to returning value to shareholders.For investors, the yield, calculated as the annual dividend per share divided by the stock's price, is a key metric. It provides insight into the return on investment from the dividend relative to the stock price. In this context, the declared annual dividend of $1.96 per common share can be compared against the sector's average to assess attractiveness.Furthermore, the declaration of dividends on various series of preferred stock indicates a tiered approach to dividend payments, catering to different investor preferences. Preferred stock dividends are typically higher than those of common stock and are prioritized in payment, which might appeal to income-focused investors. Market Research Analyst U.S. Bancorp's dividend announcement also has implications for market perception and the bank's competitive positioning. Dividends are often seen as a signal of a company's confidence in its future earnings. Thus, maintaining or increasing dividends can positively influence investor sentiment and potentially the stock price.Investors and analysts often look at dividend payout ratios (the percentage of earnings paid to shareholders in dividends) to gauge whether a company is paying out a sustainable amount of its earnings. A payout ratio that is too high might not be sustainable in the long term, while a ratio that is too low might indicate that the company is retaining more earnings for growth or that it has ample room to increase dividends in the future.Additionally, in the banking industry, regulatory capital requirements and stress tests impact the ability of banks to pay dividends. It's essential to consider the regulatory environment and capital adequacy when analyzing dividend announcements in this sector. Economist From an economic perspective, dividend declarations can reflect broader economic conditions. In a robust economy, banks typically perform well due to increased lending and investment activities, which can lead to higher dividends. Conversely, during economic downturns, banks may face pressure on profits, which could affect dividend payments.The decision to pay dividends also relates to the opportunity cost of capital allocation. By opting to pay dividends, U.S. Bancorp is indicating that returning capital to shareholders is currently a preferable option over alternative uses of funds, such as reinvestment in the business or acquisitions. This decision is influenced by the bank's assessment of potential growth opportunities and the economic landscape.It is also important to consider the impact of interest rate changes on the banking sector. As interest rates rise, banks may benefit from wider net interest margins, which could support stronger dividend payments. However, if rates rise too quickly, it could stifle loan growth and increase payment defaults, potentially impacting dividends negatively. 03/12/2024 - 04:47 PM MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Board of Directors of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) has declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.49 per common share, payable April 15, 2024, to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 29, 2024.

The company expanded its practitioner network and launched BioteRx products. They also repurchased founder shares and initiated a $20M share repurchase program. Despite a net loss in 2023, adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin increased. The 2024 financial outlook predicts revenue of $200-$204 million and adjusted EBITDA of $60-$63 million. Positive Revenue increased to $185.4 million in 2023, a 12.4% rise from the previous year. Procedure revenue was up by 9.3% to $141.0 million in 2023. Gross profit margin improved to 68.8% in 2023. Net loss in 2023 was $(2.8) million, with a net loss margin of (1.5)%, compared to a net income of $1.3 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 was $55.3 million, with an EBITDA margin of 29.8%. 2024 financial guidance includes revenue of $200-$204 million and adjusted EBITDA of $60-$63 million. Biote repurchased 18.4M founders' shares and initiated a $20M share repurchase program. The company launched BioteRx products in 2023 and expanded its practitioner network to over 7,100. Operating income for 2023 was $28.7 million, compared to an operating loss of $(60.7) million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA margin for 2023 was 29.8%, compared to 30.4% in 2022. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported revenue growth of 12.4% in 2023, compared to the previous year, indicates a positive trend in Biote's financial performance. The increase in procedure revenue and dietary supplements revenue signifies a robust demand for the company's services. However, the net loss of $(2.8) million for the year, despite an increase in gross profit margin, raises concerns about the company's cost management and operational efficiency.Investors should note the gross profit margin improvement, which suggests effective cost control in the production and service delivery process. Nevertheless, the reported net loss margin of (1.5)% could impact investor confidence and may require a deeper analysis of the operational costs and one-time expenses that contributed to the loss.The share repurchase program and the agreement to repurchase founders' shares at an average price of $4.17 per share are strategic moves that could potentially enhance shareholder value by reducing the number of outstanding shares and potentially increasing earnings per share. This repurchase strategy is frequently used to signal confidence in the company's future prospects and to return value to shareholders. Market Research Analyst Biote's expansion of its practitioner network and the launch of BioteRx hormone and therapeutic wellness products align with the growing consumer focus on health and wellness. The positive initial feedback from providers for the new product offerings indicates potential market acceptance and could contribute to future revenue growth.The company's reaffirmation of its 2024 financial guidance, with anticipated acceleration in the second half of the year, reflects management's confidence in their strategy and market position. However, the anticipated low-single-digit revenue growth in the first half of 2024 suggests a cautious outlook that investors should monitor, as it may be indicative of underlying challenges in the market or operational execution.Biote's strategy to address the underserved market for hormone optimization and its anticipated second-half margin contribution from the acquisition of Asteria Health suggest a long-term growth trajectory. The company's focus on expanding its evidence-based product offerings is likely to resonate well with the current market trends toward personalized and preventive healthcare solutions. Legal Expert The settlement with the company's founder, Dr. Gary S. Donovitz, to resolve litigation is a significant development that could reduce legal uncertainties and future expenses related to the dispute. Resolving protracted legal battles is often viewed positively by investors, as it allows management to refocus on core business activities without the distraction and financial drain of ongoing litigation.However, it is important to consider the financial implications of the share repurchase agreement as part of the settlement. The repurchase will have an immediate cash outflow impact and the effectiveness of this action in enhancing shareholder value will depend on the company's future performance and stock price stability. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM Grew practitioner network to over 7,100 from 6,400 in 2022 Launched BioteRx, our new hormone and therapeutic wellness offerings Enhancing shareholder value with agreement to repurchase 18.4M founders’ shares in addition to a separate $20M share repurchase program Reaffirms 2024 financial guidance, with an acceleration in second half growth IRVING, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Biote (NASDAQ: BTMD), a leading solutions provider in preventive health care through the delivery of personalized hormone optimization and therapeutic wellness, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Highlights (All financial result comparisons made are against the prior-year period) Revenue of $45.7 million, a 2.7% increase and in line with pre-released financial guidance Procedure revenue of $34.9 million, up 6.6% Gross profit margin of 69.4%, a more than 400-basis point increase Net income of $12.1 million, representing net income margin of 26.4%, and diluted earnings per share attributable to biote Corp. stockholders of $0.18, compared to net income of $12.8 million, representing net income margin of 28.8%, and diluted earnings per share attributable to biote Corp. stockholders of $0.18 Adjusted EBITDA1 of $13.6 million, a 3.5% increase and in line with pre-released financial guidance Adjusted EBITDA margin1 of 29.7% Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights (All financial result comparisons made are against the prior year) Revenue of $185.4 million, a 12.4% increase Procedure revenue of $141.0 million, up 9.3% Gross profit margin of 68.8%, an approximately 190-basis point increase Net loss of $(2.8) million, representing net loss margin of (1.5)%, and diluted earnings per share attributable to biote Corp. stockholders of $0.13 per diluted share compared to net income of $1.3 million, representing net income margin of 0.8%, and diluted loss per share attributable to biote Corp. shareholders of $(0.12) per diluted share Adjusted EBITDA1 of $55.3 million, a 10.2% increase Adjusted EBITDA margin1 of 29.8% “Fourth quarter procedure revenue increased approximately 6.6%, reflecting stability for our hormone optimization therapies,” said Terry Weber, Biote Chief Executive Officer. “Over the year, we also continued to expand our nationwide network, growing the net number of Biote-certified practitioners to more than 7,100. “This past month, we were pleased to reach a settlement with Dr. Gary S. Donovitz, Biote’s founder, to resolve protracted and costly litigation. Under the terms of the agreement, Biote will repurchase all of his outstanding shares and paired interests over three years at an average price of $4.17 per share. We believe this repurchase will be accretive to shareholder value. In addition, we recently announced that our board of directors approved a separate stock repurchase program for up to $20 million of our Class A common stock. Ms. Weber continued, “As consumers prioritize their health and well-being, we continue to effectively address the large and underserved market for hormone optimization. In February, we began the phased launch of our new BioteRx hormone and therapeutic wellness products in the areas of body composition, sexual health and preventive wellness. Initial provider feedback has been positive, strengthening our conviction in the growth opportunity in front of us. We remain focused on accelerating the number of Biote-certified practitioners and further expanding our evidence-based product offerings to promote positive health outcomes for our patients.” 2023 Fourth Quarter Financial Review (All financial result comparisons made are against the prior-year period unless otherwise noted) Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $45.7 million, an increase of 2.7% from $44.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase in revenue was driven by procedure revenue growth of 6.6%, partially offset by a decline in dietary supplement revenue of 14.6%. As expected, fourth quarter dietary supplement revenue decreased, primarily as a result of one of the Company’s larger dietary supplement distributors exiting the nutraceutical business during the quarter. Gross profit margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 69.4% compared to 65.3% for the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to product mix and effective cost management. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $5.5 million, compared to $7.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating income in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased as growth in revenue and improved gross profit were more than offset by higher expenses, primarily for professional services. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $12.1 million, representing a margin of 26.4%, and diluted earnings per share attributable to biote Corp. stockholders of $0.18, compared to net income of $12.8 million, representing a margin of 28.8%, and diluted earnings per share attributable to biote Corp. stockholders of $0.18, for the fourth quarter of 2022. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022 included a gain of $5.4 million and $6.9 million, respectively, due to a change in the fair value of the earnout liability. Additionally, net income for the fourth quarter of 2022 included a gain of $0.6 million due to a change in the fair value of the warrant liability. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $13.6 million, with an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 29.7%, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $13.1 million, with an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 29.5% for the fourth quarter of 2022. 2023 Full Year Financial Review (All financial result comparisons made are against the prior year unless otherwise noted) Revenue for 2023 was $185.4 million, an increase of 12.4% from $165.0 million in 2022. The increase was driven by growth in both procedure revenue and dietary supplements revenue. Gross profit margin for 2023 was 68.8% compared to 66.9% for 2022. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to product mix and effective cost management. Operating income for 2023 was $28.7 million, compared to an operating loss of $(60.7) million for 2022. Operating income in 2023 included $9.1 million in stock compensation expense, $8.5 million in legal and settlements expense unrelated to on-going business and $6.1 million in transaction-related, merger and acquisition and other costs. Excluding these costs, operating income would have been $52.4 million in 2023. Operating loss in 2022 included $82.2 million in stock compensation expense, $4.2 million in legal and settlements expense unrelated to on-going business and $22.3 million in transaction-related and other costs. Excluding these costs, operating income would have been $48.0 million in 2022. Net loss for 2023 was $(2.8) million, representing a margin of (1.5)%, and diluted earnings per share attributable to biote Corp. stockholders of $0.13, compared to net income of $1.3 million, representing net income margin of 0.8%, and diluted loss per share attributable to biote Corp. shareholders of $(0.12) in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 was $55.3 million, with an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 29.8% compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $50.1 million, with an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 30.4% for 2022. 2024 Financial Outlook “As we continue to execute on our strategy, we are forecasting solid financial performance in 2024, with an expectation for stronger revenue growth in the back half of the year,” concluded Ms. Weber. ($ in millions) 2024 Guidance Ranges Revenue $200-$204 Adjusted EBITDA2 $60-$63 The Company’s 2024 financial guidance includes: (i) procedure revenue growth in the first half of 2024 similar to that of the second half of 2023 with improved growth in the back half of 2024; (ii) a return to nutraceutical revenue growth in the second half of 2024; (iii) expected modest contributions from new therapeutic wellness products; and (iv) a second-half margin contribution from the anticipated impact of the acquisition of Asteria Health. First half 2024 consolidated year-on-year revenue growth is expected to be in the low-single digits, with significant improvement expected in the second half of 2024. Total revenue growth in the first half of 2024 is expected to be impacted by the transition in the nutraceutical distribution channel and timing of seasonal promotions.

A replay of the webcast will be available on the Events page of the Biote Investor Relations website, at ir.biote.com, shortly after the event concludes. Discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, Biote has disclosed Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that it calculates as net income before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, litigation expenses, legal settlements, transaction-related expenses, merger and acquisition expenses, fair value adjustments to certain equity instruments classified as liabilities and other expenses. Below we have provided a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin because it is a key measure used by our management to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and determine payments under compensation programs. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows: Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements of our assets; Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are subject to inherent limitations as it reflects the exercise of judgment by Biote’s management about which expenses are excluded or included. A reconciliation is provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin alongside other financial performance measures, including net income and our other GAAP results. Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP financial measures because it could not do so without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of certain information needed to calculate reconciling items. For example, the Company has not included a reconciliation of projected Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income (loss), which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for the periods presented in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. The Company’s projected Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items that are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict including, but not limited to, share-based compensation expense, income taxes, due diligence expenses and legal expenses. Due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of the adjusting items that would be excluded from projected Adjusted EBITDA in future periods, management does not forecast them for internal use and therefore cannot create a quantitative projected Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income (loss) reconciliation for the periods presented without unreasonable efforts. A quantitative reconciliation of projected Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income (loss) for the periods presented would imply a degree of precision and certainty as to these future items that does not exist and could be confusing to investors. From a qualitative perspective, it is anticipated that the differences between projected Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income (loss) for the periods presented will consist of items similar to those described in the financial tables later in this release, including, for example and without limitation, share-based compensation expense, income taxes, due diligence expenses and legal expenses. The timing and amount of any of these excluded items could significantly impact the Company’s GAAP net income (loss) for a particular period. When planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods, the Company does so primarily on a non-GAAP basis without preparing a GAAP analysis.

Negative Decrease in revenue compared to the previous period. Significant net loss attributed to the sale of myAlphie. Adjusted EBITDA showing a negative value. Financial Analyst An examination of reAlpha Tech Corp's financial results for the transition period ending December 31, 2023, reveals a strategic pivot away from real estate acquisitions towards enhancing AI technology for commercial use. This shift is a response to the current macroeconomic climate characterized by rising interest rates, inflation and high property prices. The company's reported revenue of $121,690, a significant decrease from the previous year's $284,666, is largely due to a reduction in short-term rental income following property disposals and the sale of myAlphie, a technology platform. However, the firm's net loss has notably decreased from $4,241,555 to $1,251,259, which could be interpreted as an improvement in operational efficiency or a one-off benefit from the sale of myAlphie.From a liquidity perspective, reAlpha's cash and cash equivalents have increased to $6,456,370, up from $1,256,868. This improved cash position, combined with the recent capital raise of $8.0 million through a public offering, suggests a strengthened balance sheet. Nonetheless, the Adjusted EBITDA remains negative at $(2,297,480), though improved from the prior period's $(4,031,674), indicating ongoing operational challenges.The company's focus on commercializing AI technologies, such as GENA and the strategic acquisitions of Naamche and the intent to acquire United Software Group, suggest a diversification strategy that could potentially open new revenue streams and mitigate the risks associated with the volatile real estate market. Market Research Analyst The real estate technology sector is undergoing rapid transformation, with AI integration becoming a key competitive differentiator. reAlpha's introduction of GENA, an AI-powered technology designed to enhance residential property listings, positions the company at the forefront of this innovation wave. The strategic acquisitions of Naamche and the potential acquisition of United Software Group are likely to augment reAlpha's technological capabilities and market reach.Investors and stakeholders should consider the potential for reAlpha's AI technologies to disrupt traditional real estate models, especially in light of the company's pivot from direct real estate investing to technology-driven revenue generation. The company's ability to navigate the regulatory landscape and successfully integrate these acquisitions will be critical to its long-term growth trajectory and market positioning.It is also important to note the broader industry trend towards technology enablement in real estate, which is likely to increase demand for solutions that can streamline operations, enhance customer experiences and optimize property management. reAlpha's strategic direction appears to align with these industry trends, potentially offering a competitive edge in an evolving market. Legal Expert The definitive agreements to acquire Naamche and the letter of intent to acquire United Software Group underscore the importance of due diligence and regulatory compliance in corporate transactions. These acquisitions, subject to closing conditions and jurisdictional approvals, will require careful navigation of legal frameworks to ensure a smooth integration into reAlpha's business operations.Investors should be aware that such transactions can carry legal risks, including potential challenges in obtaining necessary approvals, integration issues and intellectual property considerations. The success of these acquisitions will depend on reAlpha's legal strategy and its ability to effectively manage these risks.Furthermore, the change in fiscal year-end from April 30 to December 31 demonstrates reAlpha's strategic planning and compliance with financial reporting standards. This realignment may provide a more accurate reflection of the company's financial performance and aid in the standardization of reporting practices, which is beneficial for stakeholders tracking the company's financial health. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM DUBLIN, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- reAlpha Tech Corp. (“reAlpha,” “Company,” “us,” “we” or “our”) (Nasdaq: AIRE), a real estate technology company focused on developing, utilizing and commercializing real estate-focused artificial intelligence (“AI”) technologies, today provides a business update and reports financial results for the eight month period ended December 31, 2023. In accordance with a change of its fiscal year end from April 30 to December 31, effective as of December 31, 2023, the Company is reporting results for the transition period between May 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023. “2023 marked a pivotal chapter in reAlpha’s journey,” said Giri Devanur, Chief Executive Officer of reAlpha. “We successfully debuted on the Nasdaq Capital Market in October, raised $8.0 million in gross proceeds through a public offering in November, and introduced GENA, our AI-powered real estate technology, to kick-start our goal to commercialize our technologies. Additionally, with the execution of definitive agreements to acquire Naamche, Inc. and Naamche Inc. Pvt. Ltd., coupled with a non-binding letter of intent to acquire United Software Group and certain affiliated entities, the due diligence process for which is still ongoing, we believe reAlpha is well-positioned to drive sustainable growth and create stockholder value while advancing innovative AI solutions,” concluded Mr. Devanur. Recent strategic and operational highlights during the transition period ended December 31, 2023 include: Listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker symbol “AIRE” on October 23, 2023. Announced the launch of GENA, formerly known as BnBGPT, a technology that enhances residential property listings in multiple online real estate marketplaces through the integration of personalized generative AI descriptions. Consummated a public offering for gross proceeds of $8.0 million on November 24, 2023. Entered into definitive agreements to acquire Naamche, Inc. and Naamche, Inc. Pvt. Ltd (collectively, “Naamche”), a technology company focused on developing AI-powered solutions for large industries, including real estate, which is subject to closing conditions and jurisdictional approval (the “Acquisitions”). Approved the change of our fiscal year-end from April 30 to December 31, effective as of December 31, 2023. Entered into a non-binding letter of intent to acquire United Software Group and certain subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “USG”), an Ohio-based privately-held, multi-industry information technology consulting company. Business Strategy Update Given the current macroeconomic climate, including rising interest rates, inflation, and high property prices, we decided to pause our efforts in acquiring real estate. Instead, we shifted our focus towards improving and developing our AI technologies for commercial applications, aiming to create revenue through technology while our short-term rental operations are on hold. We intend to continue commercializing our technologies to further add technology-derived revenue streams. We may resume the complementary direct real estate investing model from our rental business segment when prevailing interest rates and other macroeconomic factors align more favorably. In the meantime, our growth strategy will encompass both organic and inorganic methods through commercialization of our AI technologies that are in varying stages of development and acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies. Financial Results In accordance with a change of our fiscal year end from April 30 to December 31, effective as of December 31, 2023, we are reporting results for the transition period between May 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023. Revenue for the eight months ended December 31, 2023 was $121,690, compared to $284,666 for the eight months ended December 31, 2022. Our revenues consist of both the short-term rental revenue that we receive from our listed properties, if any, and platform services income that we receive from our technologies. This decrease in revenues is mainly attributed to lower rental income segment due to the disposal of properties during the eight months ended December 31, 2023, and lower platform services segment revenue compared to the eight months ended December 31, 2022 as a result of the sale of myAlphie. We had cash and cash equivalents of $6,456,370 as of December 31, 2023 and $1,256,868 as of April 30, 2023. Net loss was $1,251,259 for the eight months ended December 31, 2023, compared to a net loss of $4,241,555 for the eight months ended December 31, 2022. This significant decrease in net loss is predominantly attributable to the sale of myAlphie during the eight months ended December 31, 2023. This decrease in net loss may not accurately represent our current business operations and may be unusually elevated for this period due to the impact of the myAlphie sale. Adjusted EBITDA was $(2,297,480) for the eight months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $(4,031,674) for the eight months ended December 31, 2022. The full reconciliation to Adjusted EBITDA is set forth below. Explanatory Notes on Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP (“GAAP”), we believe “Adjusted EBITDA,” a “non-GAAP financial measure”, as such term is defined under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), is useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. We reconcile our non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA to our net income, adjusted to exclude interest expense, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-recurring acquisition-related compensation expenses, non-recurring direct listing expenses, unrealized gain or loss on foreign exchange, non-recurring legal reserves, settlement expenses and related costs and non-recurring gains and losses. For the transition period ended December 31, 2023 and the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023, we did not have any restructuring expenses or non-recurring acquisition-related compensation expenses.

Net loss increased significantly in Q4 2023 and FY 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. Operating costs and expenses saw a significant increase in FY 2023, including a non-cash impairment charge to goodwill of $49.6 million. Adjusted EBITDA was negative for both Q4 2023 and FY 2023. Product revenue decreased for FY 2023. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $456.8 million as of December 31, 2023. Financial Analyst Revenue Trends and Market Performance: The reported year-over-year decrease in total revenue of 2% for FY 2023, coupled with the decline in Biopharma/Pharma and Animal Health revenues, indicates a contraction in certain key market segments for Cryoport. This contraction could be attributed to broader industry challenges or increased competition. However, the substantial growth in BioStorage/BioServices and support for commercial Cell & Gene therapies, which saw a 45% and 33% increase respectively, suggests a strategic pivot or stronger demand in these emerging sectors. The 8% increase in services revenue for FY 2023 emphasizes a potential shift towards a more service-oriented business model, which may offer more stable recurring revenue streams compared to product sales.Investment and Strategic Acquisitions: Cryoport's strategic investments and acquisitions, such as Bluebird Express and Tec4med, signal an aggressive expansion strategy, aimed at enhancing their service offerings and geographical reach. These moves could position Cryoport favorably within the Cell & Gene therapy supply chain, potentially capturing more market share as the industry grows. However, investors should be mindful of the integration risks and the impact of these investments on the company's short-term financials.Stock Repurchase Program: The repurchase of common stock and convertible senior notes suggests management's confidence in the company's intrinsic value. This could be a positive signal to investors, indicating a perceived undervaluation or a strategic move to reduce dilution. Nevertheless, the efficacy of this program should be evaluated in the context of the company's overall capital allocation strategy and its long-term growth prospects. Market Research Analyst Industry Growth and Competitive Positioning: The growth in Cell & Gene therapy support and clinical trials indicates Cryoport's strong positioning within a high-growth industry. With 675 global clinical trials supported, a net increase from the previous year and the anticipation of new therapy approvals, Cryoport appears to be capitalizing on the expansion of this niche market. The company's focus on this segment could offer competitive advantages as more therapies move towards commercial approval. However, the need to continuously innovate and maintain high-quality standards is critical in this highly regulated space.Economic and Geopolitical Factors: The outlook for 2024, with revenue guidance of $242 - $252 million, suggests moderate optimism. However, the company's performance may be influenced by external factors such as supply chain constraints, inflationary pressures and geopolitical events. Cryoport's ability to navigate these challenges will be crucial in achieving its revenue targets and sustaining growth.Operational Efficiency and Margin Pressures: The decrease in gross margin from 43.8% for FY 2022 to 42.6% for FY 2023, along with increased operating costs and expenses, raises concerns about margin pressures and operational efficiency. As Cryoport expands its service offerings and scales its operations, maintaining cost control and improving margins will be essential for profitability and investor confidence. Legal Expert Regulatory Landscape and Compliance: The Cell & Gene therapy industry is subject to stringent regulatory requirements. Cryoport's support for a growing number of clinical trials and commercial therapies indicates its compliance with regulatory standards, which is pivotal for its continued operation and expansion. The company's strategic relationships, such as with NMDP BioTherapies and Cell & Gene Therapy Catapult, may enhance its regulatory expertise and compliance infrastructure. However, any changes in regulatory policies or non-compliance issues could have significant implications for Cryoport's business operations and financial performance. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM FY 2023 revenue of $233.3 million, in-line with guidanceYear-over-year, Commercial Cell & Gene Therapy revenue rose 33%; BioStorage/BioServices revenue increased 45% Global clinical trials supported reached a record 675NASHVILLE, Tenn., March 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Cryoport, Inc. (NASDAQ: CYRX) (""Cryoport""), a global leader in supply chain solutions for cell & gene therapies, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter (Q4) and year (FY) ended December 31, 2023. Jerrell Shelton, CEO of Cryoport, commented, ""Today we reported full year results including total revenue of $233.3 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Our results were within our revenue guidance range, despite the challenging operating environment we experienced throughout the year. ""Notwithstanding these challenges, there were several bright spots. In 2023, our services business, the core driver of our growth, increased to 62% of total revenue. We also experienced year-over-year growth in our revenues from BioStorage/BioServices and from the support of commercial Cell & Gene therapies of 45% and 33%, respectively, demonstrating strong demand for our services offerings. In addition, we ended the year supporting a record 675 clinical trials worldwide, a net increase of 21 clinical trials over last year with 82 of these in phase 3. We believe our clinical trials portfolio constitutes a significant long-term revenue growth opportunity for Cryoport as more therapies continue to proceed through clinical trials towards commercial approval. ""Product revenues were lower than historical levels; however, MVE Biological Solutions' revenue began to stabilize in the latter part of the year. Moreover, MVE continues to be a strong business unit, which has generated considerable free cash flow and maintained margins on its product revenue. ""Throughout 2023, we made targeted investments in our business and formed strategic relationships to further position ourselves for continued growth. Some of our actions included our acquisition of Bluebird Express last November, which is in support of accelerating CRYOPDP's U.S. expansion plans; our expanded relationship with NMDP BioTherapies (formerly known as Be The Match Biotherapies) in which they will be leveraging our new IntegriCellTM platform in support of allogeneic donor recruitment, collection, and cryo-processing; our acquisition of Tec4med, providing next generation condition monitoring; and our new collaboration with Cell & Gene Therapy Catapult in the U.K. to support Cell & Gene therapies' clinical trials and future commercial growth throughout Europe. We also made substantial progress on the business development front, welcoming a number of key new clients, as well as continuing to launch innovative products and services, including our Cryoport Elite™ UltraCold -80°C shipper, further expanding our end-to-end solutions supporting Cell & Gene therapies. ""As we enter 2024, we are focused on leveraging the strength of our industry-leading brands to serve our clients while capitalizing on the growth of the Cell & Gene therapy industry, as more of these lifesaving therapies receive regulatory approvals globally. By continuing to build out our platform and broaden our scope, we expect to further expand our market leading position in Cell & Gene therapy, arguably one of the most important segments of the life sciences. We believe our solutions, services, and products set industry standards and are critical components to bringing these life-saving treatments to patients globally. We anticipate 2024 as a year of progressive advancement in our business with stronger overall growth in our services business,"" concluded Mr. Shelton.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures, including revenue at constant currency, revenue growth rate at constant currency and adjusted EBITDA, should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that revenue growth is a key indicator of how Cryoport is progressing from period to period and we believe that the non-GAAP financial measures, revenue at constant currency and revenue growth rate at constant currency, are useful to investors in analyzing the underlying trends in revenue. Under GAAP, revenues received in local (non-U.S. dollar) currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate for the period presented. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the results of our operations and the value of our foreign assets and liabilities, which in turn may adversely affect results of operations and cash flows and the comparability of period-to-period results of operations. When we use the term ""constant currency,"" it means that we have translated local currency revenues for the current reporting period into U.S. dollars using the same average foreign currency exchange rates for the conversion of revenues into U.S. dollars that we used to translate local currency revenues for the comparable reporting period of the prior year. Revenue growth rate at constant currency refers to the measure of comparing the current reporting period revenue at constant currency with the reported GAAP revenue for the comparable reporting period of the prior year. However, we also believe that data on constant currency period-over-period changes have limitations, particularly as the currency effects that are eliminated could constitute a significant element of our revenue and could significantly impact our performance. We therefore limit our use of constant currency period-over-period changes to a measure for the impact of currency fluctuations on the translation of local currency revenue into U.S. dollars. We do not evaluate our results and performance without considering both period-over-period changes in non-GAAP constant currency revenue on the one hand and changes in revenue prepared in accordance with GAAP on the other. We caution the readers of this press release to follow a similar approach by considering revenue on constant currency period-over-period changes only in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, changes in revenue prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted for interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition and integration costs, investment income, unrealized (gain)/loss on investments, foreign currency (gain)/loss, gain on insurance claim, gain on extinguishment of debt, goodwill impairment, changes in fair value of contingent consideration and charges or gains resulting from non-recurring events. Management believes that adjusted EBITDA provides a useful measure of Cryoport's operating results, a meaningful comparison with historical results and with the results of other companies, and insight into Cryoport's ongoing operating performance. Further, management and the Company's board of directors utilize adjusted EBITDA to gain a better understanding of Cryoport's comparative operating performance from period to period and as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. Adjusted EBITDA is also a significant performance measure used by Cryoport in connection with its incentive compensation programs. Management believes adjusted EBITDA, when read in conjunction with Cryoport's GAAP financials, is useful to investors because it provides a basis for meaningful period-to-period comparisons of Cryoport's ongoing operating results, including results of operations, against investor and analyst financial models, helps identify trends in Cryoport's underlying business and in performing related trend analyses, and it provides a better understanding of how management plans and measures Cryoport's underlying business.

Positive 15.2% increase in fourth-quarter revenue for AdTheorent Holding Company, Inc. Fourth-quarter revenue reaches $59.7 million with a 19.3% gross profit increase.

Financial Analyst Analyzing the reported financials, the 15.2% increase in Q4 revenue for AdTheorent is a strong indicator of the company's growth trajectory, particularly in the context of a challenging advertising market transitioning away from traditional cookie-based tracking. The improvement in both gross profit and adjusted gross profit margins suggests operational efficiencies and a higher value product mix. The year-over-year revenue growth of 136% in self-service is particularly noteworthy, signaling a shift in the company's business model towards more scalable, platform-based solutions.However, the decrease in net income from $7.6 million to $1.3 million in Q4 and a break-even net result for the full year, compared to $28.8 million in net income the previous year, raises questions about the company's cost structure and the sustainability of its growth. The fluctuations in mark to market gains and losses related to the Seller's Earn-Out and Warrants liabilities also add a layer of complexity to the financial analysis, potentially obscuring the underlying operational performance. Market Research Analyst The strategic focus on growing accounts with larger media budgets is a prudent approach, as evidenced by the 11.8% increase in average revenue per active customer. This suggests that AdTheorent is successfully targeting and retaining higher-value clients. The growth in the health sector, with an 89% increase in revenue, is particularly impressive and indicates that AdTheorent's offerings are resonating in verticals with strict privacy requirements. The recognition by Frost & Sullivan positions AdTheorent favorably within the competitive landscape of demand-side platforms (DSPs). Technology Industry Analyst AdTheorent's focus on ID-independent machine learning technology is a strategic move in anticipation of the industry's shift away from cookies. Their efforts to configure systems to leverage Google APIs and aggregate data exchanges align with the broader industry's pivot towards privacy-centric advertising solutions. As the market continues to adapt to privacy regulations and changes in consumer data usage, AdTheorent's technology could provide a competitive edge and drive long-term growth. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM Fourth quarter revenue increased 15.2%Exceeded fourth quarter and full-year guidance NEW YORK, March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AdTheorent Holding Company, Inc.

Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. See the supplementary schedules in this press release for a discussion of how the Company defines and calculates these measures and a reconciliation thereof to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Full-Year 2024 Financial Outlook: Based on the current business environment, recent performance and the current trends in the marketplace and subject to the risks and uncertainties inherent in forward-looking statements, the Company's outlook for the full-year 2024 includes the following: Revenue in the range of $188.0 million to $195.0 million.Adjusted Gross Profit* between 64% to 65% of revenue.Adjusted EBITDA* margin of between 20% and 25% of Adjusted Gross Profit*. Although the Company provides guidance for Adjusted EBITDA, it is not able to provide guidance for net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Certain elements of the composition of net income, including equity-based compensation, are not predictable, making it impractical for the Company to provide guidance on net income or to reconcile its Adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income without unreasonable efforts. Similarly, although the Company provides guidance for Adjusted Gross Profit, it is not able to provide guidance for Gross Profit, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Certain elements of the composition of Gross Profit, including equity-based compensation, are not predictable, making it impractical for the Company to provide guidance on Gross Profit or to reconcile its Adjusted Gross Profit guidance to Gross Profit without unreasonable efforts. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information regarding net income and Gross Profit, which could be material to future results.

The Company’s management believes that this information can assist investors in evaluating the Company’s operational trends, financial performance, and cash generating capacity and make strategic decisions. Management believes these non-GAAP measures allow investors to evaluate the Company’s financial performance using some of the same measures as management. Because of the limitations associated with these non-GAAP financial measures, “Adjusted Gross Profit,” “EBITDA,” “Adjusted EBITDA,” “Adjusted Gross Profit as a percentage of Revenue” and “Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of Adjusted Gross Profit” should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate AdTheorent’s business. The tables below show the Company’s non-GAAP financial metrics reconciled to the comparable GAAP financial metrics included in this release. Adjusted Gross Profit Adjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP profitability measure. Adjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure of campaign profitability, monitored by Company management and the Board, used to evaluate the Company’s operating performance and trends, develop short- and long-term operational plans, and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. The Company believes this measure provides a useful period-to-period comparison of campaign profitability and is useful information to investors and the market in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as its management and board. Gross profit is the most comparable GAAP measurement, which is calculated as revenue less platform operations costs. In calculating Adjusted Gross Profit, the Company adds back other platform operations costs, which consist of amortization expense related to capitalized software, depreciation expense, allocated costs of personnel which set up and monitor campaign performance, and platform hosting, license, and maintenance costs, to gross profit. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of revenue to Adjusted Gross Profit for the periods presented: Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (In thousands) Revenue $59,658 $51,781 $170,809 $166,082 Less: Platform operations 28,004 25,237 89,145 83,444 Gross Profit 31,654 26,544 81,664 82,638 Add back: Other platform operations 8,248 7,203 29,567 27,182 Adjusted Gross Profit $39,902 $33,747 $111,231 $109,820 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined by the Company as net income, before interest income, net, depreciation, amortization and income tax provision. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before equity-based compensation expense, transaction costs, non-core operations and other non-recurring items. Net income is the most comparable GAAP measurement. Collectively these non-GAAP financial measures are key profitability measures used by Company management and the Board to understand and evaluate its operating performance and trends, develop short-and long-term operational plans, measure performance goals in employee equity incentive awards, and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. The Company believes that these measures can provide useful period-to-period comparisons of campaign profitability. Accordingly, the Company believes that these measures provide useful information to investors and the market in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as Company management and the Board.

Net loss of $(18.3) million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $(71.7) million in the previous year. Financial Analyst The reported financials of Purple Innovation, Inc. indicate a mixed performance with modest revenue growth in Q4 2023, but a significant annual revenue decline. The company's ability to achieve a positive adjusted EBITDA in December and its forecast for 2024 suggest a potential turnaround. However, the year-over-year increase in operating expenses, particularly in marketing, could raise concerns about cost management and profitability. The increase in showroom expenses and strategic investments, such as the expansion of showrooms and the launch of new products, may be aimed at capturing market share in the long term, but they have not yet resulted in improved bottom-line performance.Investors should consider the company's inventory management, as the reduction in inventories could be indicative of improved efficiency or a response to decreased demand. The amended debt facilities in January 2024, which increased liquidity, are a positive sign, but they also add to the company's debt burden. The projected revenue growth for 2024 and the anticipated positive adjusted EBITDA in the second half of the year could be a sign of recovery, but these projections must be weighed against the overall downward trend in the past year and the ongoing industry headwinds. Market Research Analyst The home goods sector, particularly the mattress industry, has been facing a soft demand environment, as indicated by Purple Innovation's report. The company's focus on repositioning as a premium brand and launching new products may be an attempt to differentiate itself in a competitive market. The reported increase in DTC revenue, particularly from showrooms, suggests that the company's strategy to enhance customer experience and brand perception is gaining traction, albeit slowly.Investors should note the company's efforts to increase conversion rates on its e-commerce site and optimize ad spending, which could improve sales efficiency. The emphasis on product mix shifts and manufacturing improvements may enhance margins over time. However, the efficacy of these strategies in the face of persistent industry challenges will be critical to monitor. Economist The broader economic context, including consumer spending behavior and interest in home-related goods, has a direct impact on companies like Purple Innovation. The soft demand environment suggests a cautious consumer stance, potentially influenced by macroeconomic factors such as inflation or economic uncertainty. The company's strategic initiatives to drive productivity and efficiency, as well as its focus on innovation, are essential in such an environment to maintain competitiveness and financial health.While Purple Innovation's projection of mid to high single-digit percentage revenue growth in 2024 is encouraging, it must be assessed in light of potential shifts in consumer spending patterns and economic conditions. The company's ability to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA in the latter half of 2024 will be a key indicator of its operational resilience and the success of its strategic initiatives. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM Company Projecting Mid to High Single Digit Percentage Revenue Growth in 2024 with Positive Adjusted EBITDA in the Second Half of the Year LEHI, Utah, March 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Purple Innovation, Inc.

""The fourth quarter represented an encouraging finish to 2023 as sales finished within our guidance range and increased year-over-year for the first time in eight quarters,"" said Chief Executive Officer Rob DeMartini. ""Throughout last year we made meaningful progress capturing market share and repositioning Purple as a premium brand despite ongoing industry headwinds. The launch of our innovative new mattresses and new marketing campaign fueled improved sales trends across all channels in the second half. Backed by marketing efficiencies, fourth quarter profitability was in-line with expectations highlighted by positive operating income in the month of December."" DeMartini continued, ""Looking ahead, we will continue to implement the strategic initiatives that are clearly resulting in operating and financial improvements. Specifically, our focus is on further share gains and enhancing earnings by driving productivity, efficiency and innovation across the business. This includes improving showroom and wholesale door velocity through new revenue initiatives and cost controls. Increasing conversion rates on our ecommerce site is also a priority through ongoing testing and optimization. At the same time, earnings expansion should come from price increases, product mix shifts and manufacturing improvements combined with more efficient ad spending focused on existing mattress shoppers. While near-term industry challenges persist, the foundation is now in place for long-term, profitable growth."" Fourth Quarter 2023 Review Fourth quarter 2023 net revenue increased 1.1% to $145.9 million, compared to $144.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. This increase was driven by the positive response to the Company's new product lineup, along with increased advertising spend to support the new product launch and enhanced brand positioning, partially offset by soft industry-wide demand for home-related products in the current operating environment. By channel, DTC net revenues increased 4.3% driven by slightly higher e-commerce revenue, in addition to growth in Purple showroom revenue from the addition of five net new showrooms over the previous 12 months and improvements in stores open greater than 12 months. Wholesale revenue for the fourth quarter was down 2.7%, which was ahead of industry trends driven by growing consumer adoption of the new product line. Gross margin for the fourth quarter 2023 decreased to 33.2% compared to 34.6% in the year ago period. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes discounts and one-time costs associated with the product transition, was 36.7% in the fourth quarter. These discounts and costs included industry standard price reductions on the sell-in of new mattress floor models to wholesale partners associated with the transition to the new premium and luxury product lineups and inventory reserves for legacy products. In addition, the Company experienced increased labor and airfreight costs associated with the new product launch. Net of these transitional items, gross margins were positively impacted by manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes in 2023 and increased average selling prices of the company's expanded product line. Operating expenses were $64.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $61.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. This increase in operating expenses was largely driven by a $4.0 million increase in advertising expenses to support the product launch including a brand campaign that highlights Purple's premium positioning and showcases the benefits of its proprietary sleep technology. Operating loss was $(16.2) million for the fourth quarter 2023 compared to an operating loss of $(11.9) million in the prior year period. Net loss was $(18.3) million for the fourth quarter 2023 compared to a net loss of $(71.7) million in the year ago period. Adjusted net loss which excludes adjustments for certain non-cash items and other items the Company does not consider in the evaluation of ongoing operational performance, including losses associated with the extinguishment of debt, was $(15.8) million, or $(0.15) per adjusted diluted share, compared to $(8.1) million, or $(0.09) per adjusted diluted share in the prior year period. Adjusted net income and adjusted net loss has also been adjusted to reflect an estimated effective income tax rate of 25.9% for the current year period and 25.1% for the comparable prior year period. EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2023 was $(10.1) million compared to $155.4 million in the fourth quarter 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $(9.8) million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $(0.8) million in the prior year period. Full Year 2023 Review Full year 2023 net revenue decreased 10.9% to $510.5 million, compared to $573.2 million in 2022. This decrease was primarily due to a continuation of the soft demand environment for home-related goods, partially offset by the positive response to the launch in May 2023 of the Company's new Premium and Luxe products. By channel, versus prior year, direct to consumer net revenues declined 10.2%. Within DTC, ecommerce declined 16.4%, driven primarily by the ongoing impact of softening demand. Showroom net revenue increased 15.8% driven largely by the opening of five net new showrooms in 2023 and the annualization impact of adding 27 net new showrooms in 2022 combined with the positive response to the Company's new higher-priced Luxe product, improving average selling price within the showroom channel. Wholesale net revenues decreased 11.9% year-over-year driven primarily by the soft demand environment along with the impact related to the new product launch in May 2023, including the industry-standard practice the sell-in of new floor models to wholesale partners at reduced pricing. These factors were partially offset by the growth in net new wholesale partners slots in 2023 resulting from the positive response to the new product collection. Gross margin for 2023 was 33.7% compared to 36.3% in the year ago period. This decrease was largely due to the impact of the new product launch including the industry-standard practice of new floor models being sold to wholesale partners at reduced pricing, higher labor and freight cost, decreased manufacturing efficiency, inventory reserves for legacy products and increased discounting of discontinued product through the Company's DTC sales channels. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes discounts and one-time costs associated with the product transition, was 37.2% in 2023. Operating expenses increased $34.7 million to $285.5 million compared to $250.8 million in 2022. This increase was driven primarily by an increase in marketing and sales expense of $16.9 million, or 10.2%, to $182.3 million, largely attributable to showroom expansion, coupled with costs incurred as part of the launch of the Company's new product lineup. These incurred costs include the increase in advertising expenses to support the new product launch and increased wholesale marketing and sales costs due to the transition of partner product inventories to the Company's new product lineup. In addition, the Company incurred $11.4 million of Special Committee costs and a $6.9 million goodwill impairment charge in 2023. Operating loss for 2023 was $(113.7) million compared to an operating loss of $(42.8) million in the prior year. Net loss was $(120.8) million for 2023 compared to a net loss of $(92.5) million in 2022. Adjusted net loss which excludes adjustments for certain non-cash items and other items the Company does not consider in the evaluation of ongoing operational performance, including charges in 2022 to provide for a full valuation allowance for income taxes and to fully reserve for the tax receivable agreement, Special Committee fees, goodwill impairment and losses associated with the extinguishment of debt, was $(73.0) million, or $(0.70) per adjusted diluted share, compared to $(31.4) million, or $(0.38) per adjusted diluted share in the prior year period. Adjusted net income and adjusted net loss has also been adjusted to reflect an estimated effective income tax rate of 25.9% for the current year period and 23.7% for the comparable prior year period. EBITDA for 2023 was $(92.9) million compared to $142.5 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $(54.7) million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $(0.2) million in the prior year. Balance Sheet As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, of $26.9 million compared to $41.8 million as of December 31, 2022. As released previously, in January 2024 we amended and restated our two primary debt facilities into a new $61 million term loan which increased the company's liquidity by $22 million, resulting in $48 million cash and cash equivalents subsequent to closing the transaction. Inventories at December 31, 2023 were $66.9 million, a decrease of 8.6% compared with $73.2 million at December 31, 2022, and a decrease of 7.2% compared with inventories of $72.1 million at September 30, 2023. 2024 Outlook For 2024, the Company currently expects full year revenue to be in the range of $540 to $560 million, representing an increase in the mid to high-single digit range over 2023 levels, and adjusted EBITDA between $(20) million and $(10) million. The Company expects its quarterly revenue and adjusted EBITDA performance to improve sequentially as it progresses through the year with adjusted EBITDA projected to be positive for the second half of 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and adjusted net income per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures that remove the impact of certain non-cash and non-recurring costs. Management believes that the use of such non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with additional useful information with respect to the impact of various adjustments, which we view as a better measure of our operating performance. Refer to the attached table for the reconciliation of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measure. With respect to the Company's Adjusted EBITDA outlook for the full year 2024, a quantitative reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP information cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because of the inherent difficulty of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact of the various adjusting items necessary for such reconciliation that have not yet occurred, are out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted, including but not limited to warrant liabilities and stock based compensation.

These non-GAAP financial measures are EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss, and adjusted net loss per diluted share. Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP measures differently than we do. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA A reconciliation of GAAP net loss to the non-GAAP measures of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is provided below. EBITDA represents net loss before interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, other expense (income), net, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA excluding costs incurred due to changes in the fair value of the warrant liability, debt extinguishment, stock-based compensation expense, impairment of goodwill, vendor separation fee, tax receivable agreement, nonrecurring legal fees, Board special committee costs, executive interim and search costs, severance costs, showroom opening costs, new production facility start-up costs and COVID-19 related expenses. We believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide additional useful information with respect to the impact of various adjustments and provide meaningful measures of our operating performance.

Adjusted gross margin represents adjusted net revenue less adjusted cost of revenues. Adjusted revenue represents revenue adjusted for revenue deemed lost through discounts on products during our transition to our new product line. Adjusted cost of revenues presents cost of revenues excluding certain incremental costs incurred during our transition to our new product line. We believe adjusted gross margin provides additional useful information with respect to the impact of certain temporary or one-time items and provides a meaningful measure of our operating performance.

(i.e. there is no allocation of net loss to noncontrolling interests), which assumes the full exchange at the beginning of the period of all outstanding Paired Securities for shares of Class A common stock of Purple Innovation, Inc., adjusted for certain nonrecurring items that we do not believe directly reflect our core operations. Adjusted net loss per share, diluted, is calculated by dividing adjusted net loss by the total shares of Class A common stock outstanding plus any dilutive warrants, options and restricted stock as calculated in accordance with GAAP and assuming the full exchange of all outstanding Paired Securities as of the beginning of each period presented. Adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per diluted share, are supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent, and should not be considered, alternatives to net loss and loss per share, as calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per diluted share, supplement GAAP measures and enable us to more effectively evaluate our performance period-over-period.

The company highlighted positive growth in Food Service Technology sales but a decline in Casino and Gaming sales. The CEO expressed confidence in the company's transition and the potential for growth in 2024. Financially, there was a decrease in net income and EBITDA for the fourth quarter, although full-year results showed improved net sales, gross profit, and operating income compared to 2022. Positive Positive points include the growth in Food Service Technology sales by 54% year-over-year and a 25% increase in full-year net sales compared to 2022. The company's focus on enterprise-level sales with the new BOHA! Terminal 2 received positive customer feedback, leading to the addition of twelve new logos in the fourth quarter. The strategic engagement of a long-term advisor to determine the company's best strategy reflects a proactive approach to business development. The outlook for 2024 anticipates total net sales between $53 million and $58 million, with a breakeven adjusted EBITDA. The company's use of non-GAAP financial measures like EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provides investors with insights into the company's core operations. These measures help evaluate operating performance by excluding items that do not reflect ongoing operations, allowing for a clearer assessment of the business's financial health. Negative Negative aspects include a 62% decrease in Casino and Gaming sales for the fourth quarter of 2023. Operating loss was reported for the same period, with a net loss of $(62) thousand. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA also decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The uncertainty regarding the occurrence or amount of adjustments necessary for a quantitative reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial measures may pose challenges for investors seeking a clear understanding of the company's financial performance. The $1.5 million severance charge related to the former CEO's resignation impacted adjusted net income for the full year 2023, potentially affecting investor perception of the company's financial stability. Market Research Analyst The reported decline in quarterly net sales by 26% year-over-year for TransAct Technologies is a significant indicator of the company's performance in a competitive market. This contraction can be attributed to various factors, including market saturation, increased competition, or a potential decline in demand for the company's products. However, the 54% increase in Food Service Technology (FST) sales suggests a strategic pivot or a successful product launch that could potentially offset declines in other segments, such as Casino and Gaming, which saw a 62% decrease. The diversification of revenue streams is crucial in mitigating risks associated with market volatility.Investors should consider the implications of the company's operating loss in the fourth quarter, juxtaposed with a full-year operating income, reflecting a potential variability in quarterly performance. The increase in gross margin year-over-year from 45.8% to 48.0% for the quarter and a more pronounced full-year gross margin increase from 42.0% to 52.9%, indicate improving efficiency or a shift towards higher-margin products. The engagement of a strategic advisor to determine the company's long-term strategy could signal a transformative phase, possibly involving restructuring, divestment, or acquisition opportunities. Financial Analyst TransAct's financials reveal a complex picture, with a significant year-over-year sales drop in the fourth quarter yet an overall annual increase in net sales. The discrepancy between quarterly and annual performance highlights the need for a detailed analysis of the underlying causes, such as cyclical trends or one-off events. The increase in FST recurring revenue by 33% for the quarter and 28% for the full year suggests a growing customer base and a successful subscription-based model, which is a positive sign for future revenue stability and predictability.However, the forecast for 2024 indicates expected total net sales to be lower than the full year 2023, with adjusted EBITDA projected to be approximately breakeven. This outlook may raise concerns about the company's growth trajectory and profitability potential. Investors should also note the use of non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, which exclude certain expenses and provide a different view of financial health compared to GAAP measures. It is essential to understand these adjustments to fully evaluate the company's operational performance. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures such as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA requires careful consideration. While these measures can offer valuable insights into a company's operational performance, they must be presented alongside the most comparable GAAP measures, with reconciliations provided. TransAct's use of non-GAAP measures is in line with regulatory requirements, as they furnish reconciliations to GAAP net income (loss). However, investors and analysts should be aware of the adjustments made and the reasons behind them, such as the exclusion of share-based compensation and severance charges, to fully understand the company's financial position.Additionally, the engagement of a strategic advisor indicates that the company is exploring significant changes that could have legal implications, such as mergers, acquisitions, or corporate restructuring. Shareholders and potential investors should monitor these developments closely, as they can have material effects on the company's future operations and stock performance. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM 2023 Fourth Quarter Net Sales of $13.3 Million, down 26% on a Year-Over-Year Basis Quarterly Food Service Technology (“FST”) Sales of $4.7 Million, up 54% on a Year-Over-Year Basis Quarterly Casino and Gaming Sales of $4.2 Million, down 62% on a Year-Over-Year Basis HAMDEN, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TransAct Technologies Incorporated (Nasdaq: TACT) (“TransAct” or the “Company”), a global leader in software-driven technology and printing solutions for high-growth markets, today reported preliminary results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. “This was a year of change here at TransAct, and I believe that the organization has emerged from this transition stronger, more efficient, and operationally more effective,” said John Dillon, Chief Executive Officer of TransAct. “On the FST side, we believe that we now have the right team in the right places selling to enterprise-level organizations with our new BOHA!

Our outlook for non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is presented only on a non-GAAP basis because not all of the information necessary for a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is available without unreasonable effort, primarily due to uncertainties relating to the occurrence or amount of these adjustments that may arise in the future. If one or more of the currently unavailable items is applicable, some items could be material, individually or in the aggregate, to GAAP reported results. 2023 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Conference Call and Webcast TransAct is hosting a conference call and webcast today, March 12, 2024, beginning at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss the Company’s preliminary fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and other matters. Both the call and the webcast are open to the general public. The conference call number is 877-704-4453 and the conference ID number is 13744766 (domestic or international). Please call ten minutes prior to the presentation to ensure that you are connected. Interested parties may also access the conference call live on the Internet at www.transact-tech.com (select “Investor Relations” followed by “Events & Presentations”). Approximately two hours after the call has concluded, an archived version of the webcast will be available for replay at the same location. Non-GAAP Financial Measures TransAct is providing certain non-GAAP financial measures because the Company believes that these measures are helpful to investors and others in assessing the ongoing nature of what the Company’s management views as TransAct’s core operations. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide the Company with an understanding of one aspect of earnings before the impact of investing and financing charges and income taxes. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide relevant and useful information to an investor evaluating the Company’s operating performance because these measures are: (i) widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items that do not reflect the Company’s ongoing operations and are excluded from the calculation of such measure; (ii) used as financial measurements by lenders and other parties to evaluate creditworthiness; and (iii) used by the Company’s management for various purposes including strategic planning and forecasting and assessing financial performance. Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share provide the Company with an understanding of the results of the primary operations of the business by excluding the effects of special items (for example, the $1.5 million severance charge related to the resignation of the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer) that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of the Company’s operations. The Company uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period operating performance because the Company believes this provides a more comparable measure of the Company’s continuing business, as these measures adjust for the special items that are not reflective of the normal results of the business. The presentation of this non-GAAP information is not considered superior to or a substitute for, and should be read in conjunction with, the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. A reconciliation of EBITDA to net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found attached to this release. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and is adjusted for (1) share-based compensation, (2) the $1.5 million severance charge related to the resignation of the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer and (3) any other items, when they occur, that we believe do not reflect the ordinary earnings of the Company’s ongoing business. The Company adjusts EBITDA for share-based compensation because the Company considers share-based compensation to be a non-cash expense similar to depreciation and amortization. The Company also adjusts for the severance charge related to the resignation of the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer because the Company believes this charge does not reflect the ordinary earnings of the Company’s operations. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found attached to this release. Adjusted net income (loss) is defined as net income (loss) adjusted for (1) the $1.5 million severance charge related to the resignation of the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer and (2) any other items, when they occur, that we believe do not reflect the ordinary earnings of the Company’s ongoing business. A reconciliation of adjusted net income (loss) to net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found attached to this release. Adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share is defined as adjusted net income (loss) divided by diluted shares outstanding. A reconciliation of adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share to net income (loss) per diluted share, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found attached to this release.

(NYSE: NRGV) reported impressive FY 2023 financial results with revenue of $341.5 million, up 134% YoY and 18% QoQ, and a cash position of $146 million. They reduced quarterly cash OpEx by 25-30% and expect to be cash flow positive by 2024. The company saw strong global momentum in Gravity energy storage, including new agreements and projects across multiple continents. Energy Vault also announced new product developments and an Investor and Analyst Day in May 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported revenue increase of 134% year-over-year (YoY) and 18% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) for FY 2023 is a significant indicator of robust growth, particularly for a company in the sustainable energy storage sector. This performance, being within the annual guidance range, suggests that the company's financial planning is effective and reliable. The increase in cash position to $146 million, surpassing prior guidance, demonstrates strong liquidity and financial health, which is particularly important for investors assessing risk. However, a gross margin of 5.1% is relatively low, indicating potential inefficiencies or high costs relative to revenue, which could be a concern for profitability in the long term. The reduction in the quarterly cash Operating Expense run rate by 25-30% is a decisive action towards cost control and could signal an improvement in future profitability and a strategic shift towards becoming cash flow positive.Energy Vault's focus on expanding its commercial pipeline and global presence, particularly in gravity energy storage, is noteworthy as it diversifies revenue streams and reduces geographical risk. The growth in the commercial pipeline by 89% YoY is impressive and suggests a strong market demand for the company's products. The development agreement with the US public utility for long-duration energy storage requirements could also provide a stable revenue source in the future. However, the net loss widening by 26% YoY could raise concerns about the company's current ability to manage expenses relative to revenue growth. Energy Market Analyst Energy Vault's strategic advancements in the energy storage sector, including the interconnection with China's state grid and the expansion in Southern Africa, indicate a significant competitive edge in the global market. The successful deployment of battery energy storage systems and the commencement of construction on the green hydrogen energy storage micro-grid system in collaboration with PG&E highlight the company's innovative approach and capability to deliver on complex projects. The proprietary VaultOS Energy Management Software is a key differentiator that not only streamlines operations but also introduces a SAAS recurring revenue model, which is favorable for long-term financial stability.The emphasis on gravity energy storage technology and the signing of a $20 million license and royalty agreement are strategic moves that can lead to high-margin recurring revenue streams. This is particularly important in the renewable energy sector where long-term contracts and technology licensing can provide predictable and stable cash flows. The development agreement in Washington State and the construction of the green hydrogen project both suggest that Energy Vault is actively pursuing growth in the burgeoning long-duration energy storage market, which is critical as the world transitions to more sustainable energy solutions. Sustainability Analyst Energy Vault's operational highlights reflect a strong commitment to sustainability and innovation in the energy sector. The deployment of gravity-based energy storage systems and the focus on green hydrogen technology position the company at the forefront of long-duration energy storage solutions, which are essential for integrating renewable energy sources into the grid. The company's efforts in reducing its cash Operating Expense run rate align with sustainable business practices by improving operational efficiency and reducing waste.

The Investor Day will include new product and customer announcements, portfolio updates and financial guidance. WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Energy Vault Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: NRGV) (“Energy Vault” or “the Company”), a leader in sustainable, grid-scale energy storage solutions, announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2023. “The Energy Vault team successfully executed on our most important priority that we set at the beginning of 2023 –deployments of our first energy storage projects across multiple customers delivered on time, on budget and at the quality, safety and performance levels that meet or exceed our customer expectations,” said Robert Piconi, Chairman and CEO of Energy Vault. “In addition to commissioning ~1 GWh of battery and hybrid short duration energy storage systems in the second half of 2023 under our new OS-Vault Energy Management System, we also continued to solidify our global leadership position in long duration energy storage with gravity energy territory expansions across the globe in the US with a large public utility and Southern Africa to complement explosive growth in China with total projects now surpassing 3.7 GWh of EVx gravity energy systems. With the innovation in motion with the construction start of the largest green hydrogen energy storage micro-grid in the USA with PG&E in California serving a multi-day, ultra-long duration storage need, we are clearly demonstrating our unmatched capabilities as an energy storage solutions provider. We look forward to sharing more at our upcoming Investor and Analyst Day in May.” Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights Fourth quarter revenue of $118.2 million and full year 2023 revenue of $341.5 million largely driven by successful deployment of our battery energy storage systems. Full year revenue was within our 2023 guidance range held consistent through the year. Fourth quarter GAAP gross margin of 3.4% and gross profit of $4.0 million. Q4 quarterly gross margin was lower than expected due to timing of recognition of positive margin impacts in both battery and gravity related gross profit that shifted from Q4 and is now expected in 2024. Gross margin and gross profit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, were thus 5.1% and $17.5 million, respectively. Fourth quarter net loss improved 4.8% year over year to $(22.2) million while full year net loss was 26% larger at $(98.4) million due to the impact of non-cash related stock-based compensation and the shift of gross profit from Q4 2023 to 2024. Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA declined $3.6 million year over year to $(14.8) million reflecting a shift in timing of both battery and gravity revenue and gross profit from Q4 2023 to 2024. Full year Adjusted EBITDA declined $50.7 million to $(62.1) million, within our guidance range. Total cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet of $145.6 million and no debt as of December 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents improved $13.4 million compared to the balance as of September 30, 2023. Secured non-cash project performance bonding capacity remains in excess of $1 billion available to facilitate upcoming project deployment and customer growth in the near to intermediate term. Operating and Other Highlights Gravity energy storage is building momentum: The Rudong, China 100 MWh gravity energy storage system is approaching full operation as it was fully interconnected to the local state utility grid in December 2023, which will enable full commissioning, inverse power transmission, and operational activity powered by the State Grid. Three additional gravity based EVx projects totaling 368 MWh have broken ground in China including 68 MWh Zhangye, 200 MWh Jinta, and 100 MWh Huailai. Gravity-based EVx projects in China now total 3.7 GWh, all of which are expected to generate high margin recurring revenue royalty streams to Energy Vault. Signed a $20 million 10-year gravity technology license and royalty agreement with GESSOL covering the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC). GESSOL is a consortium including WBHO, one of the largest listed EPC companies in Southern Africa, iX Engineers, and Sizana Solutions. Total addressable market for the 16 member-state SADC is expected to be 125 GWh through 2035, providing us another attractive growth geography for our gravity technology. Signed a development agreement with a public utility in Washington State to develop and deploy Energy Vault gravity energy storage technology with total need being multiple GWh’s of storage capacity. VaultOS Energy Management Software delivered in SAAS recurring revenue model with Vault-Bidder and Vault-Manager software rounding out the portfolio Battery energy storage execution and outlook are strong: Began Commercial Operations of the Stanton Battery Energy Storage System with Wellhead and W Power. Built using Energy Vault’s proprietary system design and Energy Management System, the Stanton Energy Storage System is one of the largest energy storage systems in Southern California. The 68.8 MW/275.2 MWh battery energy storage system is fully operational at its maximum capacity, providing clean power and improving grid resiliency in the Southern California Edison service territory. Reached substantial completion on our 440 MWh battery energy storage system with NV Energy as of December 2023 and expect to achieve final completion in the first quarter 2024. 100 MW/200 MWh project with Jupiter Power expected to be commissioned in the first quarter 2024. Awarded 2.5 GWh-DC battery energy storage by leading international IPP. Green hydrogen energy storage creating new and disruptive segment: Began construction of the largest green hydrogen long duration energy storage system in the US with PG&E in Calistoga, California. The project is supported by a 10.5-year tolling agreement with commercial operation expected by the end of the second quarter 2024. This solidifies Energy Vault’s global leadership role in green hydrogen technology for long duration energy storage. Proactively shortened the expected time required to reach positive Adjusted EBITDA: Optimized cost structure resulting in 2024 expected cash operating expense approximately 25 – 30% lower compared to 2023, with cost reductions beginning to be realized in the fourth quarter 2023.

The adjusted EBITDA measure excludes the financial impact of items management does not consider in assessing our ongoing operating performance, and thereby facilitates review of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis. In evaluating adjusted EBITDA, one should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments noted above. Our presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these types of adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss, operating loss, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Our adjusted EBITDA measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: it does not reflect our cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments; it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; it does not reflect stock-based compensation, which is an ongoing expense; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and our adjusted EBITDA measure does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; it is not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows; it does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; it does not reflect limitations on or costs related to transferring earnings from our subsidiaries to us; and other companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be available to use to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using adjusted EBITDA only supplementally.

The company emphasized its focus on the purchase market and highlighted acquisitions to drive growth.","Guild Holdings Company Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Guild Holdings Company (GHLD) announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023, with $15.0 billion in originations, $0.7 billion in net revenue, and $39.1 million in net loss for the year. The company emphasized its focus on the purchase market and highlighted acquisitions to drive growth. Positive Total in-house originations of $15.0 billion in 2023, with $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter Net revenue of $0.7 billion in 2023, including $57.2 million in the fourth quarter Net loss of $39.1 million in 2023, with $93.1 million in the fourth quarter Adjusted net income of $48.0 million in 2023, including $12.5 million in the fourth quarter Expanded market share with acquisitions and extended share repurchase program Acquisition of Academy Mortgage to become the 8th largest non-bank retail mortgage lender Decline in net revenue and adjusted net income compared to the prior year Servicing segment net loss of $72.1 million in the fourth quarter Share repurchase program and extension of the program Cash and cash equivalents of $120.3 million as of December 31, 2023 Negative Net loss of $39.1 million in 2023 Decrease in adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA compared to the prior year Valuation adjustments with respect to MSRs resulting in a loss of $134.7 million in the fourth quarter Decrease in gain on sale margins on originations and pull-through adjusted locked volume Financial Analyst The reported figures indicate a substantial year-over-year decline in net income and a shift from a net gain in the previous year to a net loss in the current year. The reduction in total in-house originations by 22% and net revenue by 44% reflect a challenging environment for the mortgage industry, likely due to higher interest rates and a cooling housing market. The gain on sale margin contraction signifies tightening profitability, which is concerning for investors. A return on equity of (-3.2%) and an adjusted return on equity of 3.9% suggest capital is not being utilized efficiently, potentially affecting investor confidence and stock valuation. The acquisition of Academy Mortgage, however, could be a strategic move to bolster market share and may provide a pathway for recovery once the market stabilizes. Market Research Analyst Despite the overall negative financial performance, Guild Holdings' focus on purchase originations at 93% vs. the industry estimate of 81% indicates a strategic alignment with current market demand, favoring purchase over refinance in a rising rate environment. The acquisition of Academy Mortgage could enhance their competitive positioning, expanding their geographic footprint and product offerings. This strategic move, coupled with the extended share repurchase program, reflects management's confidence in the company's long-term value proposition. However, market stabilization remains uncertain and the company's performance will likely be influenced by broader economic trends and interest rate movements. Real Estate Economist The mortgage industry is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations and overall economic conditions. The data suggests that Guild Holdings has experienced a downturn consistent with broader industry trends, as indicated by the decline in origination volumes and profitability. The servicing portfolio's unpaid principal balance (UPB) growth of 8% is a positive note, indicating a growing asset base that could provide stable revenue streams. However, the significant valuation adjustment loss on MSRs (Mortgage Servicing Rights) reflects the impact of higher interest rates on these assets' value. The company's future performance will be contingent on its ability to navigate a potential economic slowdown and capitalize on its recent acquisitions. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM Originations of $15.0 Billion in 2023, Including $3.5 Billion in Fourth Quarter Net Revenue of $0.7 Billion in 2023, Including $57.2 Million in Fourth Quarter Net Loss of $39.1 Million in 2023, Including $93.1 Million in Fourth Quarter Adjusted Net Income of $48.0 Million in 2023, Including $12.5 Million in Fourth Quarter Return on Equity of (3.2%) and Adjusted Return on Equity of 3.9% in 2023 Gain on Sale Margin on Originations of 330 bps in the Fourth Quarter 93% of Originations were Purchase Originations in the Fourth Quarter Expanded Market Share Subsequent to Quarter-End with Acquisition Extended Share Repurchase Program SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Guild Holdings Company (NYSE: GHLD) (“Guild” or the “Company”), a growth-oriented mortgage company that employs a relationship-based loan sourcing strategy to execute on its mission of delivering the promise of homeownership, today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. “We have continued to leverage the strength of our platform to grow market share as we execute on our strategy that is focused on the purchase market,” stated Terry Schmidt, Guild Holdings Chief Executive Officer. “We are proud to be a lender of choice in the communities across the country that we serve by providing creative solutions for homebuyers seeking to finance their homes in this higher rate environment. As we look forward, we are encouraged by the market stabilization that is emerging, but anticipate a more muted environment in the near term, particularly in the seasonally slower first quarter.” Ms. Schmidt continued, “By being disciplined and focusing on maintaining a robust capital position, we have effectively pursued complementary and compelling acquisitions and team additions to position us for growth when the cycle turns. We are pleased with our most acquisition of Academy Mortgage, which lifts Guild to become the 8th largest non-bank retail mortgage lender and represents a 25% increase to origination volume based on results from both organizations through the third quarter of 2023, according to data from Inside Mortgage Finance Publications. This acquisition marks the fifth transaction over past year and a half, adding new geographies, loan officers and products that will continue to distinguish Guild in the marketplace and allow us to create meaningful value for our shareholders over time.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights Total in-house originations of $3.5 billion compared to $4.3 billion in the prior quarter Originated 93% of closed loan origination volume from purchase business, compared to the Mortgage Bankers Association industry estimate of 81% Net revenue of $57.2 million compared to $257.3 million in the prior quarter Net loss of $93.1 million compared to net income of $54.2 million in the prior quarter Servicing portfolio unpaid principal balance of $85.0 billion as of December 31, 2023, up 2% compared to $83.7 billion as of September 30, 2023 Adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA totaled $12.5 million and $13.2 million, respectively, compared to $29.0 million and $43.9 million, respectively, in the prior quarter Return on equity of (30.2%) and adjusted return on equity of 4.1%, compared to 17.2% and 9.2%, respectively, in the prior quarter Full Year 2023 Highlights Total in-house originations of $15.0 billion compared to $19.1 billion in the prior year Originated 93% of closed loan origination volume from purchase business, compared to the Mortgage Bankers Association estimate of 81% Net revenue of $0.7 billion compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year Net loss of $39.1 million compared to net income of $328.6 million in the prior year Servicing portfolio unpaid principal balance grew 8% to $85.0 billion as of December 31, 2023 compared to $78.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 Adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA totaled $48.0 million and $74.8 million, respectively, compared to $70.0 million and $103.5 million, respectively, in the prior year Return on equity of (3.2%) and adjusted return on equity of 3.9%, compared to 30.3% and 6.4%, respectively, in the prior year Fourth Quarter and Full Year Summary Please refer to “Key Performance Indicators” and “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations” elsewhere in this release for a description of the key performance indicators and definitions of the non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the nearest comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).

Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP and to provide investors with additional information regarding our GAAP financial results, we disclose certain financial measures for our consolidated and operating segment results on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP (adjusted) basis. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, results prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Adjusted Net Income. Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP for Adjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP measure. We define Adjusted Net Income as earnings or loss attributable to Guild excluding (i) the change in the fair value measurements related to our MSRs due to changes in model inputs and assumptions, (ii) change in the fair value of contingent liabilities related to completed acquisitions, net of change in fair value of notes receivable related to acquisitions, (iii) amortization of acquired intangible assets and (iv) stock-based compensation. We exclude these items because we believe they are non-cash expenses that are not reflective of our core operations or indicative of our ongoing operations. Adjusted Net Income is also adjusted by applying an estimated effective tax rate to these adjustments. In addition, we exclude the change in the fair value of MSRs due to changes in model inputs and assumptions from Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA below because we believe this non-cash, non-realized adjustment to net revenues is not indicative of our operating performance or results of operations but rather reflects changes in model inputs and assumptions (e.g., prepayment speed, discount rate and cost to service assumptions) that impact the carrying value of our MSRs from period to period. Adjusted Earnings Per Share—Basic and Diluted. Earnings per share is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP for Adjusted Earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure. We define Adjusted Earnings Per Share as our Adjusted Net Income divided by the basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding of our Class A and Class B common stock. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding is adjusted include potential shares of Class A common stock related to unvested RSUs that were excluded from the calculation of GAAP diluted loss per share because they were anti-dilutive due to the net loss, when applicable. Adjusted EBITDA. Net income (loss) is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP for Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before (i) interest expense on non-funding debt (without adjustment for net warehouse interest related to loan fundings and payoff interest related to loan prepayments), (ii) taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization and (iv) net income attributable to the non-controlling interests and excluding (v) any change in the fair value measurements of our MSRs due to valuation assumptions, (vi) change in the fair value of contingent liabilities related to completed acquisitions, net of change in fair value of notes receivable related to acquisitions and (vii) stock-based compensation. We exclude these items because we believe they are not reflective of our core operations or indicative of our ongoing operations. Adjusted Return on Equity. Return on equity is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP for Adjusted Return on Equity, a non-GAAP measure. We define Adjusted Return on Equity as annualized Adjusted Net Income as a percentage of average beginning and ending stockholders’ equity during the period. Tangible Net Book Value Per Share. Book value per share is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP for Tangible Net Book Value Per Share. We define Tangible Net Book Value Per Share as total stockholders’ equity attributable to Guild, less intangible assets, net and goodwill divided by the total shares of our Class A and Class B common stock outstanding. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for Tangible Net Book Value Per Share is book value per share. We use these non-GAAP financial measures (other than Tangible Net Book Value Per Share) to evaluate our operating performance, to establish budgets and to develop operational goals for managing our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are designed to evaluate operating results exclusive of fair value and other adjustments that are not indicative of our business’s operating performance. Accordingly, we believe that these financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects.

Highlights include gross written premiums of $164.9 million in Q4, net income of $33.0 million, and a combined ratio of 76.7%. CEO Mr. Waleed Jabsheh emphasized consistent underwriting and growth strategies. Positive IGIC reported a 46.7% increase in net income for Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022, driven by underwriting income and net investment income growth. Return on average equity for Q4 2023 was 26.1%, up from 22.7% in Q4 2022, showcasing strong financial performance. Underwriting income for the full year 2023 increased by 23.2% to $183.1 million, with a combined ratio of 76.7% indicating efficient operations. Gross written premiums grew by 18.3% to $688.7 million for the year, reflecting solid premium growth across segments. Book value per share increased by 36.7% to $12.40 at the end of 2023, demonstrating significant shareholder value appreciation. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of International General Insurance Holdings Ltd. for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 indicate a substantial improvement in several key performance metrics. The adoption of U.S. GAAP accounting standards and the restatement of prior period comparatives provide a consistent basis for analyzing financial performance. A Financial Analyst would focus on the growth in gross written premiums, which increased by 18.3% year-over-year, reflecting the company's ability to expand its portfolio in a competitive market.The combined ratio, an important measure of profitability in the insurance industry, improved to 76.7% for the full year, demonstrating effective cost control and underwriting discipline. The net income growth of 32.5% year-over-year and a return on average equity of 24.8% indicate strong operational efficiency and capital utilization. These figures suggest a robust financial position, which could influence investor confidence and the company's stock market performance. Insurance Industry Analyst An Insurance Industry Analyst would note the strategic significance of the growth in the Short-tail and Reinsurance Segments. The Short-tail Segment's gross written premiums grew by 38.2% in the fourth quarter, which is significant as short-tail lines typically allow quicker assessment of underwriting performance. The Reinsurance Segment, though smaller, showed remarkable growth, indicating a strategic move to capitalize on favorable market conditions and pricing.The reported decrease in the Long-tail Segment suggests a potential strategic shift or market-driven repositioning. The loss ratio, which has remained relatively stable, along with the decreased net policy acquisition expense ratio, suggests that the company is managing its expenses effectively in relation to its earned premiums. These segment-specific insights shed light on the company's underwriting strategy and risk management. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, a Market Research Analyst would find the company's performance indicative of broader industry trends. The increase in net investment income aligns with the rising interest rate environment, which has allowed for higher yields on investment portfolios. This trend is likely to persist as monetary policy continues to adjust to inflationary pressures.The company's proactive capital management, as evidenced by its share repurchase program and the increase in book value per share by 36.7%, reflects a strategic approach to shareholder value maximization. These activities, along with the reported foreign exchange gains and the impact of derivative financial liabilities, provide a comprehensive view of the company's financial health and strategic maneuvers in response to market conditions. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM HAMILTON, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- International General Insurance Holdings Ltd.

IGI CEO Mr. Waleed Jabsheh said, “During the fourth quarter of 2023, we continued on the trajectory of the first nine months of 2023, with strong performance to finish the year with record results across a number of metrics. These excellent results culminated in a combined ratio of 76.7%, the lowest full year combined ratio in IGI’s history, and a core operating return on average equity of 28.1% for the full year 2023, demonstrating consistent selective and disciplined underwriting, focusing on those lines with the strongest margins.” “Market conditions remained positive through the January 1 renewal period, and we are continuing to see healthy opportunities in reinsurance and many short-tail lines. Pricing in our long-tail lines remains adequate by and large, although conditions in these lines are becoming more challenging. Overall in 2023, we achieved net rate increases of 6.5% across our portfolio, with strong premium growth of 18.3%.” “While the world around us has become increasingly polarized and our industry increasingly challenged, IGI, as always, remains focused on consistently executing our strategy, growing our company, and being a reliable and trusted partner to our brokers and clients. We are committed to our strategic priority of managing the cyclicality and inherent volatility of our business, and focused on maximizing shareholder value through active and efficient capital management.” Results for the Periods Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 increased 46.7% to $33.0 million from $22.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The increase in net income was primarily driven by the increase of $18.8 million in underwriting income and the positive movement of $6.4 million in net investment income. This was partially offset by the negative movement of $6.1 million in the change in fair value of derivative financial liabilities relating to warrants and earnout shares, and $5.5 million of higher general and administrative expenses. Return on average equity (annualized) was 26.1% for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 22.7% for the fourth quarter of 2022. Core operating income, a non-GAAP measure, was $30.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $13.6 million for the same period in 2022. The core operating return on average equity (annualized) was 23.7% for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 13.7% for the fourth quarter of 2022. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 32.5% to $118.2 million from $89.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in net income was primarily driven by an increase of $34.5 million in underwriting income, and positive movement of $35.8 million in net investment income, partially offset by the negative movement of $31.9 million in the change in fair value of derivative financial liabilities and $11.7 million increase in general and administrative expenses. The increase in general and administrative expenses is due to new hires, professional fees and IT related expenses. Return on average equity was 24.8% for the full year of 2023 compared to 22.5% for the full year of 2022. Core operating income was $133.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $93.9 million for the same period in 2022. The core operating return on average equity was 28.1% for the full year of 2023 compared to 23.7% for the full year of 2022. Underwriting Results Underwriting income increased 76.1% to $43.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $24.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, with the increase primarily driven by higher net premiums earned as a result of the overall growth of the portfolio. Gross written premiums were $164.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, representing an increase of 6.5% compared to gross written premiums of $154.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The increase was driven by growth in the Short-tail Segment. The loss ratio was 47.6% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 compared to 55.6% for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The net policy acquisition expense ratio was 14.5% in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 18.8% in the same quarter of 2022. The combined ratio for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 improved by 10.3 points to 81.8% compared to 92.1% for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Underwriting income increased 23.2% to $183.1 million for the full year of 2023 compared to $148.6 million for the full year of 2022, with the increase primarily driven by higher net premiums earned of $70.8 million as a result of the growth in the Short-tail and Reinsurance Segments, partially offset by $31.5 million higher net loss and loss adjustment expenses across all Segments. Gross written premiums were $688.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing an increase of 18.3% compared to gross written premiums of $582.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was driven by growth in the Reinsurance and Short-tail Segments. The loss ratio was 42.3% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 41.9% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The net policy acquisition expense ratio was 16.8% in the full year of 2023 compared to 18.7% for the same period of 2022. The combined ratio for the year ended December 31, 2023 improved by 1.8 points to 76.7% compared to 78.5% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Segment Results The Long-tail Segment, which represented 33% of the Company’s gross written premiums for the full year 2023, recorded gross written premiums of $64.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of 14.0% compared to $75.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Net premiums earned for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 were $37.6 million, a decrease of 9.4% compared to $41.5 million in the same quarter in 2022, primarily as a result of the lower level of gross written premium. Underwriting income was $7.0 million, a decrease of 30.7% compared to $10.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The decline was primarily due to a lower level of net premiums earned in the fourth quarter of 2023. Gross written premiums for the full year of 2023 were $226.9 million, a decrease of 2.7% compared to $233.1 million for the full year of 2022. Net premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $157.8 million, a decrease of 5.7% compared to $167.4 million in the same period in 2022. Underwriting income was $57.4 million, a decrease of 31.5% compared to $83.8 million in the full year of 2022, primarily due to a lower level of net premiums earned and a higher level of net loss and loss adjustment expenses in the full year of 2023. The Short-tail Segment, which represented 58% of the Company’s gross written premiums for the full year 2023, recorded gross written premiums of $105.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 38.2% compared to $76.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net premiums earned were $62.5 million, an increase of 33.0% compared to $47.0 million in the same quarter in 2022, driven by overall growth in this Segment. Underwriting income was $27.2 million compared to $11.4 million for the same quarter of 2022, with the increase primarily driven by the higher level of net premiums earned during the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. Gross written premiums for the full year of 2023 were $400.7 million, an increase of 26.2% compared to $317.4 million in the full year of 2022. Net premiums earned increased 32.2% to $236.2 million from $178.7 million in the comparable period in 2022. Underwriting income was $107.1 million, an increase of 87.2% compared to $57.2 million in the full year of 2022, for the same reasons described above for the quarter. The Reinsurance Segment, which represented 9% of the Company’s gross written premiums for the full year 2023, was impacted during the fourth quarter of 2023 by prior period premium adjustments, resulting in gross written premiums of negative $4.9 million, compared to $3.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. In the Reinsurance Segment, which is a relatively small part of the Company’s total portfolio in terms of dollars of premiums written, a greater proportion of business incepts in the first half of the year and is based on reinsureds’ estimates with adjustments made in subsequent quarters as actual premiums are recorded. Net premiums earned for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 were $14.8 million, compared to $8.2 million for the same quarter in 2022. Underwriting income was $9.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $3.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The improvement in underwriting income was primarily the result of an increase of 80.5% in net premiums earned in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross written premiums for the full year of 2023 were $61.1 million, reflecting significant growth when compared to $31.5 million for the full year of 2022 as a result of new business written and improved pricing in reinsurance lines. Net premiums earned were $53.2 million, compared to $30.3 million for the same period in 2022. Underwriting income was $18.6 million, compared to $7.6 million for the full year of 2022. The increase in underwriting income primarily resulted from higher net premiums earned on a higher volume of gross written premiums partially offset by a $9.7 million increase in net loss and loss adjustment expenses compared to the same period in 2022. Net Foreign Exchange Gain (Loss) The gain on foreign exchange in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $8.5 million, compared to a gain of $10.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, both of which primarily represent currency revaluation movements. The gain on foreign exchange for the full year of 2023 was $5.1 million, compared to a loss of $3.5 million in the full year of 2022. Change in Fair Value of Derivative Financial Liabilities The change in fair value of derivative financial liabilities consists of the following: (in millions of U.S. Dollars) Quarter Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Change in fair value of warrants* $0.4 ($0.2) ($6.3) $2.9 Change in fair value of earnout shares** ($7.1) ($0.4) ($21.0) $1.7 ($6.7) ($0.6) ($27.3) $4.6 * The negative movement in the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 is attributable to the increase in the fair value of warrants upon settlement of warrants in cash pursuant to the Company’s offer to purchase all of its outstanding warrants at an average purchase price of $0.95 per warrant in cash. ** The negative movement in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 was the result of the increase in the fair value of the earnout shares which was driven by the increase in the quoted market price of IGI common shares, as the market price crossed the $11.50 vesting threshold of the first tranche in the earnout shares vesting schedule. The first tranche of earnout shares vested on December 13, 2023. Investment Results Net investment income was $14.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $8.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 and included investment income of $11.6 million and $6.8 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which represented an annualized investment yield of 4.3% on average total investments and cash and cash equivalents in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 2.9% in the corresponding period in 2022. The increase in net investment income was primarily attributable to the growth in interest income, driven by the rise in interest rates on a larger investment portfolio compared with the same period of 2022. Net investment income was $50.2 million for the full year of 2023, compared to $14.4 million for the full year of 2022 and included investment income of $40.4 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which represented an investment yield of 3.9% on average total investments and cash and cash equivalents for 2023, compared to a 2.4% investment yield in the corresponding period in 2022. The increase in net investment income was primarily attributable to the growth in interest income, and positive change in net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investments. Total Shareholders’ Equity Total shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2023 was $540.5 million, compared to $411.0 million at December 31, 2022.

The CAT losses for the year ended December 31, 2023 are primarily attributable to $21.0 million of combined losses recorded for the earthquake in Turkey (in the Reinsurance Segment), and flooding in New Zealand from Cyclone Gabrielle, flash floods in India, Hurricane Otis in Mexico, adverse weather conditions in Oman and Hawaii Wildfires (all in the Short-tail Segment), and a general CAT reserve of $9.0 million. ** See “Supplementary Financial Information - Combined Ratio (Unaudited)” International General Insurance Holdings Ltd. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The table below illustrates the split of loss ratio between current accident year, current year CAT losses, which are included in ‘Net loss and loss adjustment expenses’, and prior years’ loss development is as follows: Quarter Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (in millions of U.S. Dollars, except percentages) Net loss and loss adjustment expenses % of net premiums earned Net loss and loss adjustment expenses % of net premiums earned Net loss and loss adjustment expenses % of net premiums earned Net loss and loss adjustment expenses % of net premiums earned Current year net incurred claims $54.7 47.6% $53.8 55.6% $189.1 42.3% $157.6 41.9% Minus: Current accident year CAT losses $9.5 8.3% $12.1 12.5% $38.3 8.6% $24.4 6.5% Minus: Effect of prior years’ development $3.3 2.9% $4.2 4.3% ($39.3) (8.8%) ($42.0) (11.2%) Current Accident year (Prior to CAT losses) $41.9 36.4% $37.5 38.8% $190.1 42.5% $175.2 46.6% Core Operating Income Core operating income measures the performance of our operations without the influence of after-tax gains or losses on investments and foreign currencies and other items as noted in the table below. We exclude these items from our calculation of core operating income because the amounts of these gains and losses are heavily influenced by, and fluctuate in part according to, economic and other factors external to the Company and/or transactions or events that are typically not a recurring part of, and are largely independent of, our core underwriting activities and including them distorts the analysis of trends in our operations. We believe the reporting of core operating income enhances an understanding of our results by highlighting the underlying profitability of our core insurance operations. Our underwriting profitability is impacted by earned premiums, the adequacy of pricing, and the frequency and severity of losses. Over time, such profitability is also influenced by underwriting discipline, which seeks to manage the Company’s exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, IGI’s management of claims, use of reinsurance and the ability to manage the expense ratio, which the Company accomplishes through the management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses. In addition to presenting net income for the period determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe that showing “core operating income” provides investors with a valuable measure of profitability and enables investors, rating agencies and other users of our financial information to analyze the Company’s results in a similar manner to the way in which Management analyzes the Company’s underlying business performance.

Financial Analyst The reported revenue growth for Heron Therapeutics' oncology care franchise and the record quarterly sales of ZYNRELEF indicate a positive trajectory in the company's financial performance. The increase in gross margin to 71% from the previous year's 58% is a significant improvement, reflecting better cost management and potentially higher profitability per unit sold. The reaffirmed guidance for 2024 suggests management's confidence in the company's continued growth and cost control measures.Investors should note the impact of the expanded FDA approval for ZYNRELEF, which could substantially increase the addressable market for the drug. The partnership with CrossLink Life Sciences, LLC is expected to amplify the promotional efforts, potentially leading to increased market penetration and sales volume. The anticipated launch of the ZYNRELEF Vial Access Needle and Prefilled Syringe could also enhance the product's ease of use and accessibility in clinical settings, further driving sales. Medical Research Analyst The FDA approval for an expanded indication of ZYNRELEF is a pivotal development, potentially increasing its usage across approximately 13 million procedures annually. This expanded label could lead to a higher demand for the product, assuming it effectively meets clinical needs and gains acceptance among healthcare providers. The approval highlights the drug's efficacy and safety profile, which is crucial for market adoption.Furthermore, the introduction of new administration methods like the Vial Access Needle and Prefilled Syringe represents an innovation in the drug delivery system, potentially improving patient outcomes and operational efficiency in hospitals. These advancements could lead to a competitive advantage for Heron Therapeutics in the pain management market, especially in the acute care setting. Market Research Analyst The strategic partnership and expansion of the sales force through CrossLink Life Sciences, LLC could significantly enhance Heron's market reach, particularly in the orthopedic segment. The increase in sales representatives is a direct investment in market expansion efforts. The anticipated product launches and the expansion of the sales force are proactive steps towards capturing a larger market share and are likely to be closely monitored by competitors.It is essential to track the adoption rate post-FDA approval expansion and the effectiveness of the increased sales force. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and successful commercialization strategies often dictate the long-term success of a product.

About ZYNRELEF for Postoperative Pain ZYNRELEF is the first and only dual-acting local anesthetic that delivers a fixed-dose combination of the local anesthetic bupivacaine and a low dose of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug meloxicam. ZYNRELEF is the first and only extended-release local anesthetic to demonstrate in Phase 3 studies significantly reduced pain and significantly increased proportion of patients requiring no opioids through the first 72 hours following surgery compared to bupivacaine solution, the current standard-of-care local anesthetic for postoperative pain control. ZYNRELEF was initially approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the ""FDA"") in May 2021 for use in adults for soft tissue or periarticular instillation to produce postsurgical analgesia for up to 72 hours after bunionectomy, open inguinal herniorrhaphy and total knee arthroplasty. In December 2021, the FDA approved an expansion of ZYNRELEF's indication to include foot and ankle, small-to-medium open abdominal, and lower extremity total joint arthroplasty surgical procedures. On January 23, 2024, the FDA approved ZYNRELEF for soft tissue and orthopedic surgical procedures including foot and ankle, and other procedures in which direct exposure to articular cartilage is avoided. Safety and efficacy have not been established in highly vascular surgeries, such as intrathoracic, large multilevel spinal, and head and neck procedures. ZYNRELEF was granted a marketing authorization by the European Commission in September 2020 and by the United Kingdom Regulatory Authority in January 2021. In August 2023, we cancelled the ZYNRELEF U.K. marketing authorization and, in October 2023, we cancelled the ZYNRELEF European Union (EU) marketing authorization, as we do not plan to commercially launch ZYNRELEF in the U.K. or the EU.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our financial results presented on a GAAP basis, we have included information about certain non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed with our results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provide analysts, investors, lenders, and other third parties with insights into how we evaluate normal operational activities, including our ability to generate cash from operations, on a comparable year-over-year basis and manage our budgeting and forecasting. In our quarterly and annual reports, earnings press releases and conference calls, we may discuss the following financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude interest expense, interest income, the benefit from or provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and other adjustments to reflect changes that occur in our business but do not represent ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA, as used by us, may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. There are several limitations related to the use of adjusted EBITDA rather than net income or loss, which is the nearest GAAP equivalent, such as: adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization, and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated or amortized may have to be replaced in the future, the cash requirements for which are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA;we exclude stock-based compensation expense from adjusted EBITDA although: (i) it has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy; and (ii) if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, the cash salary expense included in operating expenses would be higher, which would affect our cash position;adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs;adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the benefit from or provision for income taxes or the cash requirements to pay taxes;adjusted EBITDA does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;we exclude restructuring expenses from adjusted EBITDA. Restructuring expenses primarily include employee severance and contract termination costs that are not related to acquisitions. The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring expenses are not part of our underlying business;Adjusted Operating Expenses Adjusted operating expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents GAAP operating expenses adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, and other adjustments to reflect changes that occur in our business but do not represent ongoing operations. Reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating expenses to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this press release. The Company has not provided a reconciliation of its full-year 2024 guidance for adjusted EBITDA or adjusted operating expenses to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures, in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K, because the Company is unable to predict, without unreasonable efforts, the timing and amount of items that would be included in such a reconciliation, including, but not limited to, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition related expense and litigation settlements. These items are uncertain and depend on various factors that are outside of the Company's control or cannot be reasonably predicted. While the Company is unable to address the probable significance of these items, they could have a material impact on GAAP net income and operating expenses for the guidance period. Forward-looking Statements This news release contains ""forward-looking statements"" as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Heron cautions readers that forward-looking statements are based on management's expectations and assumptions as of the date of this news release and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements we make regarding the potential market opportunities for ZYNRELEF, APONVIE, CINVANTI and SUSTOL; revenue, adjusted EBITDA and other financial guidance provided by the Company; the results of the commercial launch of APONVIE; the potential additional market opportunity for the expanded U.S. label for ZYNRELEF; the timing of the Company's development of the VAN program and receipt of required regulatory approvals; our ability to establish and maintain successful commercial arrangements like our co-promotion agreement CrossLink Life Sciences; the outcome of the Company's pending ANDA litigation; whether the Company is required to write-off any additional inventory in the future; the expected future balances of Heron's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments; the expected duration over which Heron's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balances will fund its operations and the risk that future equity financings may be needed; any inability or delay in achieving profitability. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are set forth in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and in our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including under the caption ""Risk Factors.""

Financial Analyst Teledyne's acquisition of Valeport is likely to be scrutinized by investors for its impact on Teledyne's financial health. Without disclosed financial terms, the immediate effect on Teledyne's balance sheet remains speculative. However, investors should monitor future financial disclosures for acquisition-related costs and the contribution of Valeport's product lines to revenue growth.The long-term financial implications include potential revenue diversification and market expansion, which may enhance shareholder value. It is also essential to consider the possibility of integration risks that could affect the expected financial benefits of the acquisition. Investors will need to weigh the growth prospects offered by Valeport's technology against the costs and risks associated with the acquisition. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the acquisition of Valeport by Teledyne Technologies will require regulatory approval, which is a standard procedure for such transactions. Given the lack of disclosed terms, it is not possible to comment on any specific legal challenges that may arise. However, it is common for mergers and acquisitions to face scrutiny regarding antitrust laws, especially if the companies have significant market shares.Legal due diligence will be crucial to identify any potential regulatory hurdles or intellectual property issues. Additionally, the cross-border nature of the deal, with Valeport being a UK-based company and Teledyne based in the US, may introduce complexities related to international law and trade agreements. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM THOUSAND OAKS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY) (“Teledyne”) announced today that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Valeport Holdings Limited and its affiliates (“Valeport”).

(NASDAQ: NARI) announces positive two-year interim results from the CLOUT registry, showcasing excellent safety, effectiveness, and long-term outcomes of the ClotTriever system in treating deep vein thrombosis patients. The data presented at the American Venous Forum meeting reveals significantly lower rates of Post Thrombotic Syndrome compared to historical trials, emphasizing the sustained benefits of the treatment.","Inari Medical Announces Interim Two-Year Results from the ClotTriever CLOUT Registry Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Inari Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: NARI) announces positive two-year interim results from the CLOUT registry, showcasing excellent safety, effectiveness, and long-term outcomes of the ClotTriever system in treating deep vein thrombosis patients. The data presented at the American Venous Forum meeting reveals significantly lower rates of Post Thrombotic Syndrome compared to historical trials, emphasizing the sustained benefits of the treatment. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The interim results from Inari Medical's CLOUT registry represent a significant milestone in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The reported post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) rates at two years are substantially lower than those observed in previous studies like ATTRACT and CAVA. This data suggests that the ClotTriever system could potentially redefine the standard of care for DVT patients.From a research perspective, the robustness of the dataset, with third-party adjudication of safety events, adds credibility to the findings. The sustained improvement in PTS rates over two years indicates that the ClotTriever system may offer long-term benefits for patients, which is crucial given the chronic nature of PTS. The ongoing DEFIANCE trial, which compares ClotTriever treatment to anticoagulation alone, will further clarify the device's efficacy. Healthcare Economist The economic implications of the ClotTriever system's effectiveness are noteworthy. By significantly reducing the incidence of moderate-severe PTS, it could lead to a decrease in the long-term healthcare costs associated with managing chronic DVT complications. This reduction in PTS rates could translate into fewer hospitalizations, less need for additional treatments and improved quality of life for patients.Moreover, if the ClotTriever system is established as the standard of care, Inari Medical might see an increase in demand for its product. This could potentially impact Inari's market share and financial performance positively, subject to the outcomes of the DEFIANCE trial and adoption rates by healthcare providers. Medical Device Market Analyst In the context of the medical device industry, the ClotTriever system's reported efficacy could influence market dynamics. Given the device's utilization and study data, Inari Medical may solidify its position as a leader in thrombectomy devices for DVT. The company's commitment to clinical research, as evidenced by the ongoing DEFIANCE trial, could further differentiate it from competitors.Investors and stakeholders should monitor the adoption rates of the ClotTriever system and the outcomes of the DEFIANCE trial. Success in these areas may lead to an increase in Inari's stock value and could attract partnership opportunities or even acquisition interest from larger medical device companies seeking to enhance their vascular product portfolios. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM Rates of Post Thrombotic Syndrome at two years were excellent and significantly lower than rates reported in historical Deep Vein Thrombosis trialsIRVINE, Calif., March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Inari Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: NARI) (“Inari”) a medical device company focused on developing products to treat and transform the lives of patients suffering from venous and other diseases, announced positive two-year interim results from the CLOUT registry. The data was presented at the American Venous Forum meeting by principal investigator, David Dexter, MD, FACS, a vascular surgeon at Sentara Vascular Specialists in Norfolk, Virginia. The interim results are the largest prospective, multi-center two-year dataset in deep vein thrombosis (DVT) since the ATTRACT trial and confirm the excellent safety, effectiveness, and long-term outcomes of the ClotTriever system in real-world DVT patients. Patients had low incidence of independently adjudicated safety events related to rethrombosis, with only 5.0% and 8.4% at 30-days and 6 months, respectively. In the interim analysis, 228 patients completed their two-year follow-up visit. Patients had significant and sustained improvement in post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) over the follow-up period, with only 7.3% moderate-severe PTS at two years. The PTS rates reported in CLOUT are significantly lower than those from historical DVT studies such as ATTRACT and CAVA, which reported moderate-severe PTS rates ranging from 18-24%. “With third-party adjudication of all safety events in this robust, large dataset, ClotTriever has a strong safety profile. And the longer-term results are suggestive of sustained benefit through a critical window when longer-term sequalae typically manifest in DVT patients,” said Dr. Dexter. “The low PTS rate that continues to improve over time is a testament to the safety and effectiveness of wall-to-wall thrombus removal with ClotTriever.” “This data continues to reinforce the strong safety and effectiveness profile of the ClotTriever system, which is not only the most utilized, but also the most studied thrombectomy device in DVT,” said Dr. Thomas Tu, Inari’s Chief Medical Officer. “We are committed to generating best-in-class clinical data. This includes our currently enrolling randomized controlled trial, DEFIANCE, which will compare outcomes after ClotTriever treatment vs. anticoagulation alone. No other company is pursuing this level of research in VTE. In the treatment of DVT, clinical data does matter. We remain committed to establishing the ClotTriever and FlowTriever systems as standard of care for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE) patients.” PTS Rates in Context: ClotTriever CLOUT RegistryInterim results (n=228)ATTRACT Anticoagulation Arm (n=236)ATTRACT Intervention Arm (n=258)CAVA Anticoagulation Arm (n=58)CAVA Intervention Arm (n=62)2-Year PTS19.9%36.0%30.6%44.8%*30.6%*2-Year Moderate-Severe PTS7.3%24.0%18.2%24.1%*22.6%* *Median follow-up 39.0 months About Inari Medical, Inc.

About RRPRRP is a rare, difficult-to-treat and sometimes fatal neoplastic disease of the upper and lower respiratory tracts that is caused by infection with HPV 6 or HPV 11.1-4 RRP is classified based on age of onset as juvenile or adult. Currently, there is no cure for RRP and the current standard-of-care is repeated endoscopic debulking with ablation or excision of papillomatous lesions.3,4 Recurrence of papilloma after surgical removal is very common and repeated procedures are required to debulk and monitor the disease, which exposes patients to anesthetic and surgical risks, and emotional distress. RRP morbidity and mortality results from the effects of papilloma mass on the vocal cords, trachea, and lungs, which may cause voice changes, stridor, airway occlusion, loss of lung volume, and/or post-obstructive pneumonia.5 Although rare, one to three percent of RRP cases can transform into invasive squamous cell carcinoma.6,7 About PRGN-2012 AdenoVerse™ ImmunotherapyPRGN-2012 AdenoVerse immunotherapy is an innovative therapeutic vaccine with optimized antigen design that uses gorilla adenovector technology, part of Precigen's proprietary AdenoVerse platform, to elicit immune responses directed against cells infected with HPV 6 or HPV 11. Gorilla adenovectors have numerous advantages, including the ability for repeat administration, the inability to replicate in vivo, and the ability to deliver a large genetic payload. PRGN-2012 is currently under investigation in a Phase 1/2 pivotal single-arm study in adult patients with RRP in the United States (clinical trial identifier: NCT04724980). PRGN-2012 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation and Breakthrough Therapy Designation in patients with RRP by the FDA and Orphan Drug Designation by the European Commission. AdenoVerse™ ImmunotherapyPrecigen's AdenoVerse immunotherapy platform utilizes a library of proprietary adenovectors for the efficient gene delivery of therapeutic effectors, immunomodulators, and vaccine antigens designed to modulate the immune system. Precigen's gorilla adenovectors, part of the AdenoVerse library, have potentially superior performance characteristics as compared to current competition. AdenoVerse immunotherapies have been shown to generate high-level and durable antigen-specific T-cell immune responses as well as an ability to boost these responses via repeat administration. Superior performance characteristics and high yield manufacturing of AdenoVerse vectors leveraging UltraVector® technology allows Precigen to engineer cutting-edge investigational gene therapies to treat complex diseases. AdenoVerse™ Immunotherapy Clinical ProgramPrecigen's AdenoVerse immunotherapy platform is currently under clinical investigation in a Phase 1/2 study of PRGN-2009 AdenoVerse immunotherapy alone or in combination with an anti-PDL1/TGF-Beta Trap in patients with HPV-associated cancers (NCT04432597), a Phase 2 study of PRGN-2009 in combination with pembrolizumab in newly diagnosed patients with HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) (NCT05996523), a Phase 2 study of PRGN-2009 AdenoVerse immunotherapy in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer (NCT06157151), and a Phase 1/2 study of PRGN-2012 AdenoVerse immunotherapy in patients with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) (NCT04724980).

The company incurred a net loss for both periods, with Adjusted EBITDA declining. Despite challenges, the company remains optimistic for fiscal 2024 with an expected range of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. Key highlights include system migrations, capital upgrades, and a new plant in Arkansas. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Westrock Coffee Company's disclosure of its financial results and outlook for fiscal 2024 presents several key points that require a nuanced financial analysis. The reported decrease in consolidated net sales by 5.6% in Q4 and 0.4% for the full year signals potential challenges in revenue generation or market competition. However, a reduction in net loss from $55.5 million in 2022 to $34.6 million in 2023 suggests an improvement in cost management or operational efficiency.Notably, the Adjusted EBITDA decline of 25% for the full year may raise concerns about the company's profitability and cash flow generation capabilities. This metric is essential for assessing a company's operating performance without the distortion of non-operating factors such as mark-to-market adjustments or changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities. The leverage ratio of 4.4x based on net debt to fourth quarter annualized Adjusted EBITDA indicates the company's reliance on debt financing, which could be a point of interest for creditors and risk-averse investors.The 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $60 million to $80 million, while broad, provides a forward-looking estimate that can help investors gauge future performance. However, the lack of a reconciliation with forecasted GAAP net income due to uncertain or uncontrollable factors may limit the transparency needed for thorough investment analysis. Market Research Analyst The opening of Westrock Coffee's new Extract and Ready-to-Drink (RTD) plant in Conway, Arkansas, is a strategic move within the beverage industry, tapping into the growing demand for convenience and premiumization in coffee consumption. The transition to more modern manufacturing operations could position the company favorably against competitors, provided that the start-up costs, which were significant in 2023, stabilize moving forward.The Beverage Solutions segment remains the company's primary revenue driver, despite a decrease in net sales and Adjusted EBITDA year-over-year. This suggests the segment may be facing either increased competition or a shift in consumer preferences. Conversely, the Sustainable Sourcing & Traceability (SS&T) segment shows a more stable performance, which could be indicative of the industry's emphasis on sustainability and ethical sourcing.Analyzing the company's outlook and comparing it with industry trends, the projected growth in Adjusted EBITDA for 2024 could be an indicator of management's confidence in their strategic initiatives, such as the new RTD facility. However, the actual impact of this facility on the company's market share and financial performance will be critical to monitor. Economist From an economic perspective, Westrock Coffee's financial results must be contextualized within the broader economic environment, including consumer spending habits, commodity prices and competitive dynamics. The decrease in sales might reflect macroeconomic headwinds, such as reduced consumer discretionary spending or increased competition. Conversely, the reduction in net loss could indicate effective cost-cutting measures or economies of scale achieved through capital equipment upgrades and system migrations.The company's capital structure, with a leverage ratio of 4.4x, suggests a moderate to high level of financial risk, which may be influenced by interest rate fluctuations and credit market conditions. As the company commences operations at its new facility, the economic impact will depend on its ability to scale production efficiently and meet market demand without incurring disproportionate increases in operating expenses.Furthermore, the company's forward-looking guidance, while broad, may reflect management's assessment of both internal operational factors and external economic conditions. Investors should consider the potential volatility in commodity markets, particularly coffee beans and its impact on cost structures and pricing strategies. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM LITTLE ROCK, Ark., March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Westrock Coffee Company (Nasdaq: WEST) (“Westrock Coffee” or the “Company”) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023 and provides its outlook on fiscal 2024.

The $34.6 million net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 included $14.6 million of transaction, restructuring and integration expense and $11.7 million of start-up costs related to our Conway, AR extract and ready-to-drink facility, partially offset by a $10.2 million non-cash gain from the change in fair value of warrant liabilities. The $55.5 million net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 included $13.2 million of transaction, restructuring and integration expense, $29.7 million of non-cash expense from the change in fair value of warrant liabilities, and $5.9 million of interest expense related to the early extinguishment of debt.Adjusted EBITDA was $45.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $15.0 million, or 25%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.Beverage Solutions segment contributed $722.9 million of net sales and $41.6 million of Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $685.3 million and $54.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022.Sustainable Sourcing & Traceability (“SS&T”) segment, net of intersegment revenues, contributed $141.8 million of net sales and $3.5 million of Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $182.6 million and $6.1 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2022.At December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $147.2 million of unrestricted cash and undrawn borrowings under its revolving credit facility, and the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio was 4.4x based on net debt to fourth quarter annualized Adjusted EBITDA. 2024 Outlook As previously disclosed on February 15, 2024, the Company expects consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to be between $60 million and $80 million in fiscal 2024. The guidance range is necessarily broad to account for the range of results the Company may experience as it commences operations at its Extract and RTD facility in Conway, Arkansas and the commercialization of customers at that facility. This guidance is an estimate of what the Company believes is realizable as of the date of this release, and actual results may vary from this guidance and the variations may be material. Management will provide additional details regarding the 2024 outlook on its earnings results call to be held today. The Company is not readily able to provide a reconciliation of forecasted Adjusted EBITDA to forecasted GAAP net income without unreasonable effort because certain items that impact such figure are uncertain or outside the Company’s control and cannot be reasonably predicted. Such items include the impacts of non-cash gains or losses resulting from mark-to-market adjustments of derivatives and the change in fair value of warrant liabilities, among others.

_____________________________1 - Net of intersegment revenues Non-GAAP Financial Measures We refer to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in our analysis of our results of operations, which are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). While we believe that net (loss) income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure, we also believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance as they contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the Company’s future operating performance and comparisons to the Company’s past operating performance. Additionally, we use these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the performance of our segments, to make operational and financial decisions and in our budgeting and planning process. The Company believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures to investors helps investors evaluate the Company’s operating performance, profitability and business trends in a way that is consistent with how management evaluates such performance. We define “EBITDA” as net (loss) income, as defined by GAAP, before interest expense, net, provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA before equity-based compensation expense and the impact, which may be recurring in nature, of transaction, restructuring and integration related costs, including management services and consulting agreements entered into in connection with the acquisition of S&D Coffee, Inc., impairment charges, changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities, non-cash mark-to-market adjustments, certain costs specifically excluded from the calculation of EBITDA under our material debt agreements, such as facility start-up costs, the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs, costs incurred as a result of the early repayment of debt, gains or losses on dispositions, and other similar or infrequent items (although we may not have had such charges in the periods presented). We believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are important supplemental measures to net (loss) income because they provide additional information to evaluate our operating performance on an unleveraged basis. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated similar to defined terms in our material debt agreements used to determine compliance with specific financial covenants. Since EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should be viewed in addition to, and not be considered as alternatives for, net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP. Further, our computations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to that reported by other companies that define EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. What were Westrock Coffee Company's net sales for the fourth quarter of 2023? Westrock Coffee Company's net sales for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $215.0 million.

The offering was made under an effective shelf registration statement, with the remaining proceeds allocated for general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of Lazard Group LLC's offering of $400 million in Senior Notes with a 6.000% interest rate due in 2031 represents a significant refinancing move. This action indicates a strategic approach to capital management, particularly in the context of repurchasing their existing 3.750% Senior Notes due in 2025. The increase in the interest rate from 3.750% to 6.000% reflects the current market conditions and cost of borrowing, which is likely a result of the prevailing interest rate environment.The repurchase of the 2025 Notes could lead to potential interest savings if the market rates were to rise further before the 2025 maturity date, although it increases the immediate interest expense due to the higher rate on the new Notes. This move could be seen as a hedge against future interest rate volatility. For stakeholders, the implications are twofold: there is a near-term increase in interest costs, which may affect short-term profitability, but there is also the potential for longer-term stability in the company's debt profile. Market Research Analyst Investors and market participants often view such refinancing activities as an indicator of a company's financial health and its management's outlook on future market conditions. Lazard Group's decision to issue new Senior Notes at a higher rate suggests a proactive stance in managing its debt obligations amidst an environment where interest rates are expected to fluctuate. This could be interpreted as a positive signal that the company is taking steps to ensure liquidity and manage risks associated with its debt obligations.However, the increase in the interest rate also indicates that the cost of capital for firms is rising, which could have broader implications for the financial sector. Companies with significant refinancing needs may face higher costs, potentially impacting their investment decisions and profitability. The successful completion of the offering reassures investors about Lazard Group's creditworthiness and market access, which is crucial for maintaining investor confidence. Legal Expert The offering was conducted under an effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, illustrating compliance with regulatory requirements for such transactions. The adherence to the SEC regulations and the detailed disclosure of the use of proceeds demonstrate transparency and corporate governance practices that are essential for investor trust.Moreover, the exclusion of jurisdictions where the Tender Offer is prohibited and the adherence to local laws where broker or dealer involvement is required, underscores the legal complexities and the need for meticulous legal planning in executing such financial strategies. It is important for investors to understand that such legal considerations can affect the availability and terms of investment opportunities, reflecting the intricate relationship between corporate finance activities and legal compliance. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Lazard, Inc.

About Velo3D: Velo3D is a metal 3D printing technology company. 3D printing—also known as additive manufacturing (AM)—has a unique ability to improve the way high-value metal parts are built. However, legacy metal AM has been greatly limited in its capabilities since its invention almost 30 years ago. This has prevented the technology from being used to create the most valuable and impactful parts, restricting its use to specific niches where the limitations were acceptable. Velo3D has overcome these limitations so engineers can design and print the parts they want. The company’s solution unlocks a wide breadth of design freedom and enables customers in space exploration, aviation, power generation, energy, and semiconductor to innovate the future in their respective industries. Using Velo3D, these customers can now build mission-critical metal parts that were previously impossible to manufacture. The fully integrated solution includes the Flow print preparation software, the Sapphire family of printers, and the Assure quality control system—all of which are powered by Velo3D’s Intelligent Fusion manufacturing process. The company delivered its first Sapphire system in 2018 and has been a strategic partner to innovators such as SpaceX, Honeywell, Honda, Chromalloy, and Lam Research. Velo3D has been named as one of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies for 2023. For more information, please visit Velo3D.com, or follow the company on LinkedIn or Twitter.

(TILE) declares a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share, payable on April 12, 2024, to shareholders of record as of March 29, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly cash dividend by Interface, Inc. is a direct indicator of the company's current financial health and its commitment to returning value to shareholders. A dividend of $0.01 per share, while seemingly nominal, can be reflective of a conservative payout policy, especially in industries where cash flow stability is paramount. It is essential to compare this figure to the company's earnings per share (EPS) and payout ratios to assess sustainability. If the dividend payout ratio (dividends per share divided by EPS) is within a reasonable range, it suggests that the company is balancing reinvestment in the business with shareholder returns.Moreover, the consistency of dividend payments can signal confidence from the board in the company's future earnings. Investors often view regular dividends as a sign of a company's maturity and stability, which can be a factor in the stock's attractiveness, particularly to income-focused investors. However, the market may have already priced in these dividend declarations and any significant stock price movements are more likely to occur in response to deviations from expected dividend levels or changes in the company's fundamental performance. Market Research Analyst The flooring solutions sector, where Interface, Inc. operates, is subject to economic cycles, with demand often correlated to construction and renovation activities. The declaration of a dividend can be seen as a positive signal about the company's market position and its ability to generate cash in a competitive environment. It is important to analyze the company's market share, the competitive landscape and overall industry trends to understand the potential for future growth and profitability.Interface's dividend policy should also be evaluated in the context of its capital allocation strategy, including investments in innovation and sustainability initiatives, which are increasingly important in the industry. The company's ability to balance shareholder returns with necessary investments to maintain a competitive edge will be crucial for long-term success. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Interface, Inc.

Agree Realty Declares Monthly Common and Preferred Dividends,2024-03-12T20:05:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Agree Realty Corporation (ADC) announces a 2.9% increase in monthly cash dividend to $0.247 per common share, totaling $2.964 annually.

The Company also declares a monthly dividend of $0.08854 per depositary share for its Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Agree Realty Corporation of a 2.9% increase in its monthly cash dividend per common share signifies a positive signal to the market, reflecting the company's confidence in its financial stability and profitability. From a financial perspective, this increment in dividend payout is generally perceived as a company's assertion of strong cash flow and a robust balance sheet. Investors often view such dividend increases as a commitment to returning value, which can lead to a favorable response in the stock price.However, it is crucial to evaluate the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the stock price. An increase in dividend yield can make the stock more attractive to income-focused investors. Conversely, if the stock price appreciates significantly, the yield may remain relatively unchanged despite the increase in the absolute dividend amount. It is also essential to consider the payout ratio, the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends, to assess whether the increased dividend is sustainable in the long run without compromising growth investments. Market Research Analyst From a market research perspective, the dividend increase by Agree Realty Corporation can be seen as a reflection of the company's market position and operational efficiency in the real estate sector. It suggests that the company is generating sufficient revenue and maintaining cost control to support a higher dividend payout. This could potentially attract a broader base of investors, particularly those seeking stable income streams such as retirees or conservative investors.Additionally, the company's decision to increase dividends may be compared with industry benchmarks and competitors' dividend policies. If Agree Realty Corporation's dividend growth rate outpaces its peers, it could indicate a competitive advantage or a more shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy. However, it is also important to analyze the overall health of the real estate market, as sector-specific risks could impact future dividend sustainability. Economist Considering the broader economic context, the dividend increase announcement by Agree Realty Corporation could be interpreted within the framework of current interest rate trends and inflationary pressures. In a low-interest-rate environment, higher dividend-paying stocks become more attractive relative to fixed-income securities, potentially driving demand for shares of companies like Agree Realty Corporation. Conversely, if interest rates are rising, the relative attractiveness of dividend stocks might decrease.Inflation also plays a critical role in the real value of dividend payments. A modest increase in dividends may not keep pace with high inflation, leading to a decrease in purchasing power for investors. It's imperative to analyze whether the dividend growth rate exceeds the inflation rate to ensure that investors realize a real return on their investment. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM ROYAL OAK, Mich., March 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Agree Realty Corporation (NYSE: ADC) (the ""Company"") today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized, and the Company has declared, a monthly cash dividend of $0.247 per common share.

Financial Analyst The reported financial results from ClearPoint Neuro, Inc. for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2023, reflect a significant year-over-year revenue growth of 32% for the quarter and 17% for the full year. This continued growth trajectory, marking the ninth consecutive year of increase, is indicative of a robust business model and potential market confidence in the company's offerings, which include device, cell and gene therapy-enabling technologies.The biologics and drug delivery segment's revenue surge by 49% is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests a growing demand for the company's services in preclinical and clinical trials. This segment's expansion is a positive sign for investors, as it may lead to a diversified revenue stream and reduced dependency on any single product line. However, the reported decrease in gross margin from 66% to 57% raises concerns about the cost efficiency of the company's operations, particularly as it scales up its services. This could be a point of focus for investors assessing the sustainability of profit margins in the long term. Market Research Analyst The operational highlights of ClearPoint Neuro for early 2024, including the addition of six new hospital customers and multiple FDA clearances, signify a strong start to the year and suggest potential for market expansion. The first-in-human procedures and first product approved under European MDR indicate the company's commitment to innovation and regulatory compliance, which are critical factors for long-term success in the medical device and biologics sectors.Furthermore, the successful completion of a public offering resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $15 million not only strengthens the company's balance sheet but also highlights investor enthusiasm in the biotech sector. The ability to retire outstanding debt within the next 12 months could improve the company's financial flexibility and attractiveness to potential partners. These operational milestones could have a favorable impact on investor sentiment and the company's stock performance. Medical Research Analyst The publication of validation papers for ClearPoint's Maestro and PRISM products in peer-reviewed journals serves as an important endorsement of the company's technology and can enhance its scientific credibility. Such publications are critical in the medical community for establishing the efficacy and safety of new medical technologies. This can lead to increased adoption in clinical settings and potentially catalyze further revenue growth.Additionally, the 510(k) clearance for the Smartframe OR™ Stereotactic System signifies regulatory approval for market entry, which is a key hurdle in the medical device industry. This clearance, along with the first product shipments to the EU under the new MDR certification, indicates ClearPoint Neuro's ability to navigate complex regulatory environments, a significant competitive advantage in the global market. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM Release Includes Commentary on Early 2024 ProgressSOLANA BEACH, Calif., March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ClearPoint Neuro, Inc. (Nasdaq: CLPT) (the “Company”), a global device, cell, and gene therapy-enabling company offering precise navigation to the brain and spine, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2023. 2023 Full Year and Fourth Quarter Highlights Reported fourth quarter 2023 revenue of $6.8 million, a 32% year-over-year increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2022;Reported revenue of $24.0 million for the full year 2023, an increase of 17% over 2022 and representing the ninth consecutive year of growth;Increased biologics and drug delivery revenue to $13.6 million for the full year 2023, a 49% increase over 2022;Completed Certification of Carlsbad development and manufacturing facility and shut down of Irvine manufacturing facility; andCash burn of $1.2 million in the fourth quarter, bringing cash and cash equivalents to $23.1 million as of December 31, 2023. 2024 Operational Highlights Six new hospital customers already added since the beginning of the year;Received 510(k) clearance for Smartframe OR™ Stereotactic System;First-in-Human cases performed using ClearPoint 2.2 Software and ClearPoint Array 1.2 Parallel Trajectory Software;First product approved under European MDR and products shipped to Europe from new Carlsbad development and manufacturing facility;Validation Papers for ClearPoint Maestro and ClearPoint PRISM products published in peer-reviewed journals;Completed a public offering of common stock, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $15 million; andReaffirming 2024 revenue guidance to be between $28.0 million and $32.0 million. Business Outlook “We are pleased to confirm our fourth quarter 2023 performance which included record revenue of $6.8 million, over 30% topline growth, and a reduction in our quarterly cash burn to only $1.2 million, our lowest since 2020,” commented Joe Burnett, President and CEO at ClearPoint Neuro. “In just the first two months of 2024 we have already achieved some key strategic milestones including multiple FDA clearances and first-in-human procedures, first shipments to EU countries from our new Carlsbad facility and under EU-MDR certification, publication of key validation papers in peer-reviewed journals supporting both our navigation software and laser therapy system, and activation of more new clinical customers in the first quarter than in all of 2023. “As a result,” continued Burnett, “we have been able to complete an important equity offering of approximately $15 million which solidifies our balance sheet for our pharma partners and will allow us to retire our entire outstanding debt in the next 12 months. It was very encouraging to perform this capital raise alongside many other biotech companies in the past few weeks, highlighting renewed investment into this important and exciting gene and cell therapy space. We continue to look with confidence at 2024 and reaffirm our 2024 revenue guidance to be in the range of $28.0 million - $32.0 million.” Financial Results - Year Ended December 31, 2023 Total revenue was $24.0 million and $20.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Biologics and drug delivery revenue, which include sales of disposable products and services related to customer-sponsored preclinical and clinical trials utilizing our products, increased 49% to $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $9.1 million for the same period in 2022. This increase is attributable to a $6.0 million increase in service revenue related to new preclinical studies and services entered into with our partners for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in product revenue. Functional neurosurgery navigation and therapy revenue which primarily consists of disposable product commercial sales related to cases utilizing the ClearPoint system, decreased 7% to $8.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, from $9.1 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease is driven by lower service revenue of $0.6 million as a result of pausing a co-development program with one of our Brain Computer Interface partners for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. Capital equipment and software revenue, consisting of sales of ClearPoint reusable hardware and software, and of related services, decreased 21% to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $2.3 million for the same period in 2022, due primarily to a decrease in the placements of ClearPoint capital and software. The Company achieved a gross margin of 57% on its sales for 2023, compared to a gross margin of 66% for 2022. This decrease in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in biologics and drug delivery preclinical services, which, to date, have had a lower margin than in prior years, as we launch new services and increase our presence in this space. Increased costs related to the transition to the new manufacturing facility also contributed to the decrease in gross margin compared to the prior year. Operating expenses were $36.1 million for the full year 2023, compared with $29.9 million for 2022. The increase was mainly driven by an increase in personnel-related expenses, including share-based compensation, as we increased headcount to fund the expansion of the research and development, clinical, and support organizations, as well as an increase in the allowance for credit losses. Financial Results – Quarter Ended December 31, 2023 Total revenue was $6.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and $5.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, which represents an increase of $1.6 million, or 32%. Biologics and drug delivery revenue, which includes sales of disposable products and services related to customer-sponsored preclinical and clinical trials utilizing our products, increased 76% to $4.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from $2.3 million for the same period in 2022. This increase is attributable to a $1.8 million increase in service revenue, partially offset by a slight decrease in product revenue. Functional neurosurgery navigation and therapy revenue decreased 11% to $2.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from $2.3 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease was driven by lower service revenue. Capital equipment and software revenue, consisting of sales of ClearPoint reusable hardware and software, and of related services, increased 23% to $0.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from $0.6 million for the same period in 2022. Gross margin for the three months ended December 31, 2023, was 59%, as compared to a gross margin of 64% for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to an increase in biologics and drug delivery preclinical services, which, to date, have had a lower margin than in prior years, as we launch new services and increase our presence in this space. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $8.7 million, compared to $7.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was mainly driven by the increase in headcount across the organization and share-based compensation as well as an increase in the allowance for credit losses. At December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $23.1 million compared to $37.5 million at December 31, 2022, with the decrease resulting primarily from the use of cash in operating activities of $13.7 million.

Financial Analyst Clearside Biomedical's recent financial update and corporate developments reflect a strategic positioning in the biopharmaceutical market, particularly in the niche of ocular disease treatment. The capital raised through the registered direct offering of $15.0 million, alongside the upfront license fee of $5.0 million from BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, has bolstered the company's cash position substantially. With an extended cash runway into Q3 2025, Clearside appears to have secured the necessary funding to support its R&D activities without immediate dilutive financing needs. This financial stability is crucial for investor confidence, especially considering the volatile nature of biotech investments.Moreover, the establishment of a new CPT code for XIPERE® indicates a potential increase in product adoption and reimbursement, which could translate into a more predictable revenue stream. The licensing agreement with BioCryst, which includes significant milestone payments and royalties, could be a steady source of income, contingent on clinical and regulatory success. However, investors should be aware of the inherent risks of clinical trials and regulatory processes that can impact the expected revenue projections. Medical Research Analyst Clearside's focus on the development of therapies for ocular diseases, particularly wet AMD, positions it at the forefront of a high-need medical area. The Phase 2b ODYSSEY trial's progression is a critical milestone for the company, with topline data expected in Q3 2024. Positive outcomes could have significant implications for the treatment landscape and Clearside's market share. The proprietary SCS Microinjector® technology represents a potential paradigm shift in drug delivery to the back of the eye, with the promise of improved patient outcomes and convenience.Clearside's collaborative efforts with BioCryst Pharmaceuticals on a DME program and the reported safety and efficacy of partner programs utilizing the SCS Microinjector® also indicate a robust pipeline with diversified applications. While this diversification mitigates risk, the reliance on clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals remains a critical factor for the company's success. The medical community and potential investors will be closely monitoring the ODYSSEY trial results for indications of efficacy and safety, which will be pivotal in determining Clearside's future. Market Research Analyst The ophthalmology market is experiencing significant growth, driven by an aging population and the rising prevalence of diseases such as wet AMD and DME. Clearside's strategic focus on this area through its proprietary SCS Microinjector® technology could position it well to capture market share. The licensing agreements and partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies leverage Clearside's technology platform, potentially creating new revenue streams and collaborative opportunities.However, it's important to note that the market for wet AMD and DME treatments is highly competitive, with several established players and emerging therapies. Clearside's ability to differentiate its product offerings and demonstrate superior outcomes will be crucial in gaining market traction. The upcoming topline data from the ODYSSEY trial will be a significant determinant of the company's competitive edge and thus, its ability to attract and retain investor interest. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM - Phase 2b ODYSSEY Wet AMD Trial Remains on Track with Topline Data Expected in Q3 2024 - - Partner Programs Continue to Report Positive Clinical Data Utilizing SCS Microinjector® - - Strengthened Capital Position from Registered Direct Equity Offering and Recent SCS Microinjector License Agreement - - Management to Host Webcast and Conference Call Today at 4:30 P.M. ET - ALPHARETTA, Ga., March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clearside Biomedical, Inc. (Nasdaq: CLSD), a biopharmaceutical company revolutionizing the delivery of therapies to the back of the eye through the suprachoroidal space (SCS®), today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a corporate update. “This is an exciting time for Clearside with substantial progress in our tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) program and expanded use of our injection device technology for drug delivery into the suprachoroidal space,” said George Lasezkay, Pharm.D., J.D., Clearside’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “We are laser focused on completing our ODYSSEY Phase 2b clinical trial of CLS-AX (axitinib injectable suspension) in wet AMD and expect to report topline data in the third quarter of this year.” Dr. Lasezkay continued, “Our proprietary SCS Microinjector® enables reliable, simple, in-office, non-surgical drug delivery into the suprachoroidal space targeted directly to the site of disease in the back of the eye. This trusted delivery method, combined with axitinib’s differentiated mechanism of action and high potency, offers the potential for CLS-AX to be a best-in-class product for long-term maintenance therapy for wet AMD patients. In ODYSSEY, we are looking to replicate the excellent safety profile, stable vision, and reduced frequency of injections over 6 months that we observed in our OASIS Phase 1/2a and Extension Study.” “In addition, our development and commercialization partners continue to report positive safety and efficacy results utilizing our SCS Microinjector. We are very excited to begin working closely with our newest licensing partner, BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, on their program targeting diabetic macular edema (DME) exclusively using suprachoroidal delivery of their proprietary plasma kallikrein inhibitor, avoralstat. With the upfront licensing fee from BioCryst combined with our recently completed equity financing, we expect our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses into the third quarter of 2025,” concluded Dr. Lasezkay.

Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in GAAP net income and adjusted EBITDA for Nature's Sunshine Products, Inc. indicates a robust performance in the fourth quarter, with a more than tripling of net income and a 21% rise in adjusted EBITDA. Such a significant improvement in profitability metrics is likely to be received positively by investors, as it suggests operational efficiency and effective cost management. Furthermore, the company's gross margin improvement, despite inflationary pressures, is indicative of strong pricing power and cost-absorption capabilities. The no outstanding debt position coupled with a substantial cash reserve enhances the company's financial stability and provides flexibility for future investments or shareholder returns. Market Research Analyst The growth in net sales, particularly the double-digit growth in North America, signifies robust market demand and effective expansion strategies. However, the decline in the European segment and the mixed results from Latin America and Other regions warrant a closer look to understand the underlying market dynamics. The company's focus on omnichannel customer growth engines could be a response to the increasing trend of digitalization in sales and marketing. Investors may view the company's strategic initiatives to leverage high-quality products and strong balance sheet as a sign of potential for sustainable growth. Operations Management Expert The anticipated savings of $10 million in 2024 from gross margin initiatives reflects a proactive approach to cost optimization. The slight decrease in volume incentives as a percentage of net sales, despite the increase in net sales, demonstrates an effective balance between incentivizing sales volume and maintaining profit margins.

Excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates, net sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased 5.6% compared to the year-ago quarter. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 71.9% compared to 72.2% in the year-ago quarter. Inflationary pressures and changes in market mix contributed to the slight decline. Volume incentives as a percentage of net sales were 30.1% compared to 30.3% in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in volume incentives as a percentage of net sales was driven primarily by changes in market mix. Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) in the fourth quarter were $39.9 million compared to $38.8 million in the year-ago quarter. The slight increase was driven by increases in service fees in China, compensation, variable costs related to sales growth, and investments to drive digital growth and strategic initiatives. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses declined to 36.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 37.8% in the year-ago quarter. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $5.7 million, or 5.2% of net sales, compared to $4.2 million, or 4.1% of net sales, in the year-ago quarter. Other income, net, in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $2.0 million compared to $2.0 million in the year-ago quarter. Other income, net, primarily consisted of foreign exchange gains as a result of net changes in foreign currencies, in Europe and Latin America, which were largely offset by losses in Asia. The benefit from income taxes was $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to a provision of $4.1 million in the year-ago quarter. GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders was $9.0 million, or $0.46 per diluted common share, compared to $2.0 million, or $0.10 per diluted common share, in the year-ago quarter. Net income attributable to NSP China increased to $1.9 million, or $0.10 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $0.7 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, in the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders was $8.9 million, or $0.45 per diluted common share, compared to $1.9 million, or $0.10 per diluted common share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted net income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined here as net income from continuing operations before less-frequent items including, among other things, restructuring expenses and certain tax refunds. A reconciliation of adjusted net income to GAAP net income is provided in the financial tables below. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter increased to $9.7 million compared to $8.0 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was driven primarily by the aforementioned increase in operating income. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined here as net income from continuing operations before taxes, depreciation, amortization, and other income (loss) adjusted to exclude share-based compensation expense and certain noted adjustments. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA is provided in the attached financial tables.

The increase was driven by improvements in market mix, price increases in various markets, and contribution margin improvement initiatives, partially offset by increases related to inflation and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Volume incentives as a percentage of net sales in 2023 were 30.4% compared to 30.9% in 2022. The slight decrease was due to changes in market mix. SG&A in 2023 were $167.1 million compared to $153.1 million in 2022.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures We have included information which has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), such as information concerning non-GAAP net income, adjusted EBITDA and net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. We utilize the non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP net income and adjusted EBITDA in the evaluation of our operations and believe that these measures are useful indicators of our ability to fund our business. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, U.S. GAAP net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance. Other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of Nature’s Sunshine Products’ performance in relation to other companies. We have included a reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA, the most comparable GAAP measure. We have also included a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP adjusted EPS, in the attached financial tables. Net sales in local currency removes, from net sales in U.S. dollars, the impact of changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries. This is accomplished by translating the current period net sales into U.S. dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate the net sales for the previous comparable period. We believe presenting the impact of foreign currency fluctuations is useful to investors because it allows a more meaningful comparison of net sales of our foreign operations from period to period. Net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net sales in U.S. dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. With respect to our Adjusted EBITDA outlook for the full year 2024, a quantitative reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP information cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because of the inherent difficulty of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact of the various adjusting items necessary for such reconciliation that have not yet occurred, are out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted, including but not limited to warrant liabilities and stock based compensation. For the same reasons, we are unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a material impact on our future GAAP financial results.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The amendment and restatement of the existing loan note by voxeljet AG and the issuance of a new loan note, are significant financial events for the company. The restructuring of debt often indicates a strategic move to improve liquidity and manage cash flows. In this case, the net loan proceeds are earmarked for financing the operative business and for the delisting and deregistration of its American Depositary Shares (ADSs). The delisting process suggests a shift in the company's capital market strategy, potentially to focus on private funding sources or other markets. The terms of the New Loan Note, including the provision for an earlier repayment in case of a 'fundamental change', introduce a conditional element that investors should monitor closely, as such clauses can affect the company's financial stability and investor returns. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the private placement of the New Loan Note under Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 indicates a targeted approach to raising capital without the regulatory burdens of public offerings. The absence of registration under the Securities Act means that the New ADRs are subject to restrictions on their sale, which can limit liquidity for investors. It is also important to note the collateral provided to secure Anzu's claims under both notes. The security package is a critical factor in assessing the risk profile of the debt, as it can affect the recovery rate in the event of default. The implications of the delisting and deregistration of ADSs should be considered, as it may affect the company's transparency and the ability of U.S. investors to trade the securities. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, voxeljet AG's actions can be seen as a maneuver to optimize its financial structure amidst a dynamic industrial technology sector. The additional capital infusion could be a response to competitive pressures or a need to invest in research and development. However, delisting from a major exchange like NASDAQ typically reduces a company's visibility among investors and can lead to reduced trading volumes for its securities. This could impact the stock's liquidity and potentially its valuation. Stakeholders should assess the rationale behind these strategic decisions and their alignment with the company's long-term growth objectives. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM FRIEDBERG, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- voxeljet AG (NASDAQ: VJET) (""Company"") and Anzu's industrial technology investment fund, (""Anzu"") today agreed to amend and restate the existing loan note which the Company has issued to Anzu with a principal amount of USD 3,209,483.12 and a maturity date of January 3, 2028 (the amended loan note ""Existing Loan Note"") and to agree on an additional new loan note (""New Loan Note""). The New Loan Note has a principal amount of USD 5,500,000.00 which will be made available in two tranches of USD 2,750,000.00 each, the first tranche upon Anzu having received duly executed collateral documentation and the second tranche on July 15, 2024 (or such earlier date determined by either party). The New Loan Note has a maturity date of June 30, 2026, but may be due earlier for repayment if a fundamental change as defined in the New Loan Note occurs. The Existing Loan Note has been amended and restated to largely equal the terms and conditions of the New Loan Note. Customary collateral has been provided to secure Anzu’s claims under the New Loan Note as well as under the Existing Loan Note. The Company will use the net loan proceeds for financing of the operative business and for effecting the delisting and deregistration of its ADSs.

Management reiterated 2024 revenue guidance with expectations of flat to 5% growth in core business revenue and SPL Program-related revenue of approximately $3 million. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results released by MaxCyte, Inc. indicate a mixed performance with a notable 26% increase in total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022. However, this growth is overshadowed by a decline in core business revenue by 32% for the same period. This dichotomy suggests a shift in the company's revenue streams, with a significant reliance on the Strategic Platform License (SPL) Program-related revenue, which surged by 359% in the fourth quarter of 2023. The SPL Program's success could be a reflection of the company's strategic pivot or an industry trend towards partnerships and licensing agreements in cell therapy and bioprocessing applications.From an investment standpoint, the high gross margin of 90% in the fourth quarter is impressive, indicating strong profitability per unit of revenue. However, the increase in operating expenses and the resulting net losses, both quarterly and annually, raise concerns about the company's cost management and its impact on the bottom line. The increased stock-based compensation expenses also suggest a potential dilution of shareholder value. The reiteration of 2024 guidance with expected flat to modest growth in core business revenue and an anticipated decline in cash reserves to $175 million by year-end may be seen as cautious or conservative, potentially affecting investor sentiment. Market Research Analyst MaxCyte's performance must be contextualized within the broader cell therapy and bioprocessing industry. The company's increasing number of active SPL agreements, from 15 in 2022 to 23 in 2023 and the over 160 potential programs indicate a robust pipeline and strong positioning within the industry. However, the decrease in core business revenue, particularly in cell therapy and drug discovery segments, points to potential challenges in the company's traditional markets or competitive pressures.The reference to 'navigating a challenging operating environment' by the CEO hints at broader industry headwinds, such as increased capital conservatism and pipeline reevaluations among customers. This could be indicative of a shift in the industry's funding patterns or a response to macroeconomic factors. The successful support of FDA approval for a client's product and the continued expansion of SPLs can be seen as positive indicators of the company's strategic collaborations and technological capabilities, which may drive long-term growth despite short-term revenue fluctuations. Biotech Industry Analyst The financial report highlights MaxCyte's strategic focus on non-viral cell therapy platforms, a niche but rapidly evolving segment of the biotechnology industry. The company's SPL Program's substantial revenue growth signifies a growing demand for its cell-engineering technologies, which are critical in the development of next-generation cell therapeutics. This is further evidenced by the active clinical programs under the SPLs and the recent FDA approval of CASGEVYTM by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, a client of MaxCyte.However, the decline in instrument sales and leases raises questions about market saturation or possible shifts in customer preferences towards SPLs over direct purchases. The high gross margin maintained by MaxCyte is typical for the industry, where the cost of goods sold is relatively low compared to the high value of the technology offered. The projected total potential pre-commercial milestones under SPLs exceeding $1.95 billion is an indicator of the company's significant future revenue potential, albeit contingent upon the successful progression of clinical programs and regulatory approvals. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM ROCKVILLE, Md., March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MaxCyte, Inc., (NASDAQ: MXCT; LSE: MXCT), a leading, cell-engineering focused company providing enabling platform technologies to advance the discovery, development, and commercialization of next-generation cell therapeutics and innovative bioprocessing applications, today announced its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023 financial results and reiterated its 2024 guidance.

Our team adapted well to the changing environment last year, and I am confident in our ability to execute across the business this year,” said Maher Masoud, President and CEO of MaxCyte. “We are pleased with our accomplishments and progress in 2023, which included supporting the recent FDA approval of CASGEVYTM by our client, Vertex Pharmaceuticals.

Management expects to end 2024 with $175 million in total cash, cash equivalents and investments.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release contains EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure defined as earnings before interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization. MaxCyte believes that EBITDA provides useful information to management and investors relating to its results of operations. The company’s management uses this non-GAAP measure to compare the company’s performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, and for budgeting and planning purposes. The company believes that the use of EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the company’s financial measures with other companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors, and that it allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. Management does not consider EBITDA in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of EBITDA is that it excludes significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the company’s financial statements. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents EBITDA together with GAAP results. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. A reconciliation table of net loss, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to EBITDA is included at the end of this release. MaxCyte urges investors to review the reconciliation and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the company’s business.

The offering price per share was $44.00, with an option for underwriters to purchase an additional 682,500 shares. The net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and future acquisitions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The closing of RadNet's public offering, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $230.2 million, is a significant financial event for the company. The choice to exercise the option for additional shares indicates a strong demand from investors, which could be seen as a positive signal regarding market confidence in RadNet's business model and growth prospects. The capital raised is earmarked for general corporate purposes and future acquisitions, which suggests strategic moves aimed at expansion or improving competitive positioning. However, investors should be aware of the potential for dilution of existing shares, which can affect share value.Moreover, the involvement of reputable financial institutions such as Jefferies and Raymond James as joint active book-running managers, alongside other notable firms, adds a layer of credibility to the offering. It is important to monitor how the net proceeds are allocated, as effective use can lead to enhanced operational capabilities and market share growth, while poor investment decisions may not yield the expected returns. Market Research Analyst RadNet operates in the outpatient diagnostic imaging services market, which is characterized by high demand due to an aging population and the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases. The influx of $230.2 million in capital provides RadNet with the opportunity to potentially acquire smaller competitors or invest in new imaging technologies, which could improve service offerings and patient outcomes. The impact on the market could be twofold: RadNet may strengthen its market position and the industry might see increased consolidation.It's crucial to consider the competitive landscape and reimbursement rates for imaging services when evaluating the potential success of RadNet's strategic investments. The company's ability to integrate acquisitions and realize cost synergies will be a critical factor in determining the long-term return on this capital infusion. Legal Expert The offering was conducted under a shelf registration statement, a regulatory filing that allows for the quick capitalization on favorable market conditions. This method provides RadNet with flexibility but also requires strict adherence to SEC regulations. Investors should note that the effectiveness of the shelf registration and the role of the SEC in declaring it effective are safeguards to ensure transparency and compliance in the process.Furthermore, the availability of the final prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus allows stakeholders to scrutinize the details of the offering. This transparency is crucial for informed decision-making and any deviations from disclosed intentions regarding the use of proceeds can have legal implications and affect investor trust. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM LOS ANGELES, March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RadNet, Inc.

Despite a challenging market environment, the company achieved a record cash position of $100 million at year-end. Key highlights include net sales of $566.5 million, a net loss of $2.4 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $88.0 million. Latham's strategic initiatives, including cost reduction programs and fiberglass conversion, position the company for market share gains and improved profitability. Positive Latham Group, Inc. reported net sales of $566.5 million for full year 2023, down 18.6% year-over-year. The company achieved a record cash position of $100 million at year-end 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for full year 2023 was $88.0 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.5%. Latham's fiberglass conversion strategy led to consistent share gains in the in-ground pool market. The company's cost reduction programs improved margins and overall profitability despite market challenges. Negative Net sales declined by 18.6% year-over-year for full year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 38.6% year-over-year for full year 2023. The company reported a net loss of $2.4 million for full year 2023. Market Research Analyst The report indicates a significant decline in net sales and a reduction in net losses for Latham Group, Inc. The in-ground swimming pool market, particularly in the U.S., has faced challenges, with a noted decrease in new pool starts. Latham's strategic focus on fiberglass pool products, which are touted for their cost-effectiveness and ease of installation, has allowed the company to outperform the broader market decline. This suggests a potential shift in consumer preferences towards fiberglass pools over traditional concrete options.Despite the sales decline, Latham's cost reduction programs and lean manufacturing initiatives have led to improved margins. This operational efficiency could be a harbinger of increased profitability when market conditions rebound. Investors should note the company's strong cash position and reduced debt, which provide financial flexibility and may support future growth or withstand further market downturns.Looking ahead, the company's guidance for 2024 anticipates continued market challenges but also suggests confidence in their fiberglass conversion strategy and digital transformation efforts. The company's ability to generate positive cash flow in a soft market is a testament to its operational resilience. Financial Analyst Latham Group's financial results reveal a complex picture. On one hand, the decrease in net sales and a net loss for the full year reflect the broader economic challenges and a slowdown in the pool construction market. On the other hand, the improvement in adjusted EBITDA margins and the shift towards a positive net income in Q4 2023 indicate effective cost management and potentially successful strategic pivots.The liquidity position, bolstered by a record cash level and reduced capital expenditures, suggests that Latham is in a strong position to manage its debt obligations and invest in growth opportunities. The company's net debt leverage ratio of 2.25 is an important metric for investors to monitor as it provides insight into the company's financial health and risk profile.Investors should also consider the forward-looking statements regarding the 2024 guidance. While the company expects a continued downturn, the projected decrease in sales is less severe than the previous year's trend. This could indicate management's confidence in their strategic initiatives and the resilience of their business model. Sustainability Expert Latham's emphasis on fiberglass pools aligns with a growing consumer interest in sustainable and eco-friendly home improvements. Fiberglass pools are known for their longevity and lower maintenance requirements compared to traditional concrete pools, which can lead to reduced resource usage over time. Their ability to gain market share in this segment speaks to the effectiveness of their product development and marketing strategies in addressing environmental concerns.The company's investment in digital tools like 'Measure by Latham', an AI-powered measurement tool, is also noteworthy. Such innovations can streamline operations, reduce waste and improve customer engagement, potentially leading to operational efficiencies and a stronger competitive position in the market.Moreover, the increased traction of automatic safety covers not only adds a safety feature for consumers but also contributes to energy savings and reduced chemical usage, which are important considerations for environmentally conscious buyers. This product line could represent a growing niche that aligns with broader sustainability trends. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM Full Year 2023 Sales Outperformed the U.S. In-Ground Pool Market in 2023 Driven by Continued Fiberglass Conversion Substantially Reduced Cost Structure During 2023 Full Year Operating Cash Flow of $116 Million Yielded Record Cash Position of $100 Million at Year-End 2024 Guidance Anticipates Continued Ability to Outperform Industry Amid Difficult Market Conditions Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights: Net sales of $90.9 million, down 15.8% year-over-yearNet income of $0.1 million improved from prior year’s net loss of $19.0 million; Net income margin was 0.1%Adjusted EBITDA of $9.9 million, compared to last year’s $4.4 million; Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.9% Full Year 2023 Highlights: Net sales of $566.5 million, down 18.6% year-over-yearNet loss of $2.4 million versus a net loss of $5.7 million in the prior year period; Net loss margin was 0.4%Adjusted EBITDA of $88.0 million, down 38.6% year-over-year; Adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.5% LATHAM, N.Y., March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Latham Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: SWIM), the largest designer, manufacturer, and marketer of in-ground residential swimming pools in North America, Australia, and New Zealand, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 ended December 31, 2023. Commenting on the results, Scott Rajeski, President and CEO, said, “Latham navigated a very difficult market environment in 2023. We successfully implemented cost reduction programs and lean manufacturing initiatives that structurally reduced our cost basis, while maintaining our investments in future growth. These cost reduction programs improved margins as the year progressed and we expect they will enable us to considerably expand margins and overall profitability once volumes recover. At the same time, we increased productivity and efficiency for our dealers, developed new fiberglass pool models, and invested in digital tools that have enhanced the consumer’s pool buying experience. As a result of these actions, Latham is positioned for meaningful market share gains as overall industry conditions improve. “Our 2023 total sales outperformed U.S. new in-ground pool starts by approximately 10 percentage points, largely reflecting Latham’s leadership in the design, manufacture, and sale of fiberglass pools. The multi-year success of our conversion strategy has resulted in consistent share gains for fiberglass pools, which are more cost-effective, faster and easier to install, and more eco-friendly than concrete pools. In 2023, fiberglass product sales accounted for approximately 73% of Latham’s in-ground pool sales. While fiberglass product sales declined year-on-year, they outperformed the decline in U.S. in-ground pool starts by over 10 percentage points, firm indication that fiberglass is gaining share in the new-pool category. “We gained traction for our automatic safety covers in 2023, which can be used on any type of in-ground pool to prevent accidents and to protect the homeowner’s investment. Additionally, Measure by Latham, our proprietary AI-powered measurement tool for pool covers and liners, has been met with a very positive dealer response and should continue to drive demand for us in these product lines. “We also strengthened our financial position in 2023. Latham generated operating cash flow of over $116 million in 2023, repaid $13 million in debt, and ended the year with a record $102.8 million in cash. Thus, we have demonstrated our ability to manage in a soft market environment and have created substantial financial flexibility.” Fourth Quarter 2023 ResultsNet sales for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $90.9 million, down $17.0 million or 15.8%, from $107.9 million in the prior year’s fourth quarter, primarily due to lower volumes of in-ground swimming pools. Fourth Quarter Net Sales by Product Line(in thousands) Quarter Ended December 31, 2023December 31, 2022In-Ground Swimming Pools$45,799 $59,177 Covers 31,988 35,601 Liners 13,080 13,146 Total$90,867 $107,924 Cover sales outperformed the overall market decline, in part due to demand for automatic safety covers, which, in addition to their safety features, provide significant savings on heating and electricity costs and reductions in water and chemical usage. Liner sales benefited from strong replacement sales and were stable with last year’s fourth quarter. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $21.2 million, an increase of $1.9 million or 9.6%, from $19.3 million in the prior year’s fourth quarter. Gross margin expanded by 540 basis points to 23.3% from 17.9% in the prior year period, despite year-over-year sales declines due to lower pool starts. The year-over-year increases in gross profit and gross margin were due mostly to lower material costs and increased labor productivity associated with our cost-reduction efforts. Selling, general, and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) were $23.6 million, down $9.5 million or 28.6%, from $33.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding non-cash stock-based compensation, SG&A was $19.8 million compared to $23.6 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily attributable to lower headcount and reduced expenses. Net income was $0.1 million, compared to a net loss of $19.0 million, or $0.17 per share, for the prior year’s fourth quarter. Net income margin was 0.1%, compared to net loss margin of 17.6% for the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $9.9 million, up $5.5 million or 125.8%, from $4.4 million in the prior year’s fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.9%, more than double the 4.1% of the prior year period. Full Year 2023 ResultsNet sales for the full year ended December 31, 2023, were $566.5 million, down $129.2 million, or 18.6%, from $695.7 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to volume declines resulting from the decrease in new in-ground pool starts and continued destocking of inventory in the wholesale distribution channel. Full Year 2023 Net Sales by Product Line(in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2023December 31, 2022In-Ground Swimming Pools$297,828 $385,467 Covers 140,949 158,449 Liners 127,715 151,820 Total$566,492 $695,736 Pool covers represented 24.9% of full-year net sales, outperforming the overall market decline in part due to demand for our automatic safety covers as the awareness and adoption of auto covers on all pool types increased. Cover and liner sales accounted for 47.4% of total net sales for the year, of which a sizeable portion represented replacement products. Gross profit was $152.9 million compared to $216.5 million for the prior year period. Gross margin was 27.0% compared to 31.1% for the prior year period. The decrease in gross margin was primarily caused by lower utilization, partially offset by lower total fixed costs and modest material cost deflation. SG&A expenses were $110.3 million, down $36.5 million or 24.9%, from $146.8 million in the prior year period, reflecting a $28.1 million decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expense and the benefits of our cost reduction actions. SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased to 19.5% from 21.1%. Excluding non-cash stock-based compensation expense, SG&A decreased by $8.4 million, or 8.4% from the prior year period. Net loss was $2.4 million, or $0.02 per share, for the full year ended December 31, 2023, compared to net loss of $5.7 million, or $0.05 per share, in 2022. Net loss margin was 0.4% compared to net loss margin of 0.8% in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $88.0 million, down $55.3 million or 38.6%, from $143.3 million for the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.5% compared to 20.6% in 2022. Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, and LiquidityAt December 31, 2023, Latham had cash of $102.8 million, $75 million of borrowing availability on its revolving credit facility, and total debt of $301.2 million. The net debt leverage ratio was 2.25 at year-end 2023. Net cash from operating activities was $116.4 million for the full year, the majority of which reflected the cash generation capability of the company’s business, augmented by a benefit from the reduction of inventory. Capital expenditures totaled $4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $10.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Capital expenditures totaled $33.2 million for full year 2023 compared to $39.7 million for full year 2022. Summary and Outlook“Latham’s 2023 financial performance demonstrated our agility in addressing lower market demand by reducing costs, increasing productivity, and implementing continuous improvement initiatives, while continuing to successfully execute our fiberglass conversion strategy. Adjusted EBITDA margins improved throughout much of the year, and our cash position exceeded $100 million at year-end, the highest level in our history,” said Mr. Rajeski. The company expects that industry softness will continue in 2024 and currently is managing to a decline of approximately 15% in total pool starts in its markets. Guidance for full year 2024, contained in the table below, represents year-on-year sales that are 11% below 2023 levels at the midpoint, with fiberglass products continuing to increase penetration in a down market for new in-ground pools in the U.S. Adjusted EBITDA guidance assumes: stable product pricing, continued investment in sales and marketing, and engineering and R&D to accelerate the conversion to fiberglass and to strengthen our position ahead of a market turnaround, ongoing digital transformation programs, and normalized performance-based compensation. The company expects positive operating cash flow for 2024, highlighting its resilience. FY 2024 Guidance Ranges LowHighNet Sales$490 million$520 millionAdjusted EBITDA1$60 million$70 millionCapital Expenditures$18 million$22 million 1) A reconciliation of Latham’s projected Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) for 2024 is not available due to uncertainty related to our future income tax expense. Based on results to-date and current visibility, the company expects first quarter sales of $98 million to $104 million, due to a return to more normalized seasonal patterns, with progressive improvement in year-on-year sales comparisons beginning in the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter is expected to be in the range of $6 million to $8 million. “The long-term fundamentals of our industry remain compelling, and we are looking ahead to lower interest rates driving pent-up demand for in-ground pools. Outdoor living is one of the fastest growing segments of the Repair and Remodel sector, and Latham’s fiberglass and vinyl pools offer consumers a wide range of options to create lasting value in their homes, while enabling them to fully enjoy their outdoor space. Strategic growth initiatives to accelerate the conversion to fiberglass pools and a substantially reduced cost structure, together with our strong balance sheet, support our confidence in Latham’s ability to capture market share and to expand profit margins when industry conditions improve,” Mr. Rajeski concluded.

Latham has a coast-to-coast operations platform consisting of approximately 1,800 employees across over 24 locations. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe track our non-GAAP financial measures to monitor and manage our underlying financial performance. This news release includes the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and net debt leverage ratio, which are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain costs, losses, and gains that are required to be included under GAAP. Although we believe these measures are useful to investors and analysts for the same reasons it is useful to management, as discussed below, these measures are neither a substitute for, nor superior to, U.S. GAAP financial measures or disclosures. Other companies may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. We have reconciled our historic non-GAAP financial measures to the applicable most comparable GAAP measures in this news release. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key metrics used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, when considered alongside other GAAP measures. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, to utilize as a significant performance metric in our annual management incentive bonus plan compensation, and to compare our performance against that of other companies using similar measures. We have presented Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin solely as supplemental disclosures because we believe they allow for a more complete analysis of results of operations and assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance, such as (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) interest expense, (iii) income tax (benefit) expense, (iv) loss (gain) on sale and disposal of property and equipment, (v) restructuring charges, (vi) stock-based compensation expense, (vii) unrealized losses (gains) on foreign currency transactions, (viii) strategic initiative costs, (ix) acquisition and integration related costs, (x) loss on extinguishment of debt, (xi) underwriting fees related to offering of common stock, (xii) Odessa fire and (xiii) other items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) as a measure of financial performance or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this news release. There can be no assurance that we will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in the future, and any such modification may be material. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin at all or may calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin differently and accordingly, are not necessarily comparable to similarly entitled measures of other companies, which reduces the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as tools for comparison. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have their limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin: do not reflect every expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;do not reflect changes in our working capital needs;do not reflect the interest expense, or the amounts necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our outstanding debt;do not reflect income tax (benefit) expense, and because the payment of taxes is part of our operations, tax expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to operate;do not reflect non-cash stock-based compensation, which will remain a key element of our overall compensation package; anddo not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations. Although depreciation and amortization are eliminated in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect any costs of such replacements. Net Debt and Net Debt Leverage Ratio Net Debt and Net Debt Leverage Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures used in monitoring and evaluating our overall liquidity, financial flexibility, and leverage. Other companies may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. We define Net Debt as total debt less cash and cash equivalents. We define the Net Debt Leverage Ratio as Net Debt divided by last twelve months (“LTM”) of Adjusted EBITDA. We believe this measure is an important indicator of our ability to service our long-term debt obligations. There are material limitations to using Net Debt Leverage Ratio as we may not always be able to use cash to repay debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis.

Fourth quarter 2023 shows a 35% year-over-year revenue increase, driven by servicing income and gain on sale margin. The company launched a cost reduction program for productivity improvements targeting $120 million for 2024. Positive 61% reduction in annual net loss for 2023. 22% revenue decline in 2023. Strong liquidity position at the end of 2023. 35% year-over-year revenue increase in Q4 2023. Cost reduction program targeting $120 million for 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The report indicates a strategic realignment within loanDepot, with a focus on cost reduction and operational efficiency. The substantial decrease in annual net loss by 61% suggests that the company's 'Vision 2025' productivity improvements are effectively compensating for the revenue decline caused by lower market volumes. This indicates a strong operational pivot towards managing expenses in a challenging market environment.From a financial perspective, the shift towards a higher servicing income and Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) revenue, alongside a more favorable gain on sale margin, demonstrates an evolving revenue model that could provide stability against market fluctuations. The reported strong liquidity position, with a cash balance of $661 million, is a critical factor for investor confidence, especially in the context of uncertain mortgage volume recovery.However, the decrease in revenue by 22% year-over-year remains a concern, reflecting the broader challenges in the mortgage industry, including interest rate hikes and a cooling housing market. Investors should monitor the company's ability to continue its cost optimization without compromising growth potential or service quality in the long term. Market Research Analyst loanDepot's performance must be contextualized within the broader housing and mortgage markets. The company's pivot towards servicing income and the emphasis on a multi-channel origination business model are indicative of an industry-wide trend towards diversification of revenue streams in response to a volatile mortgage market.Despite the reduction in origination volume, the increase in purchase volume to 76% of total loans originated is a positive sign that loanDepot is capturing a larger share of the purchase market, which is less sensitive to interest rate changes than the refinance market. This strategic positioning could benefit the company as the housing market begins to recover.The company's investment in technology platforms and business processes is a proactive measure to enhance competitiveness. The focus on automation and productivity is consistent with industry efforts to reduce operational costs and improve margins. The success of these initiatives could set a benchmark for operational excellence in the sector. Legal Expert The accrual of $27 million related to the expected settlement of outstanding litigation is a significant financial consideration that impacts the company's expense structure. While this is a one-time expense, it's important for stakeholders to understand the nature of these legal challenges and the potential for future liabilities.The financial disclosure also highlights ongoing restructuring charges, lease and other asset impairment charges, which are indicative of the company's efforts to streamline operations. While these charges can lead to short-term financial strain, they are often necessary for long-term sustainability and profitability, especially in a sector as competitive as mortgage lending.Investors should consider the legal and regulatory landscape of the mortgage industry, as it can significantly affect operational costs and risk management strategies. Companies that navigate these complexities effectively can gain a competitive edge and improve investor confidence. 03/12/2024 - 04:03 PM Vision 2025 productivity improvements more than offset market-driven revenue decline, resulting in 61% reduction in annual net loss. Company exits 2023 with strong liquidity position. Full-year 2023 highlights: Revenue decreased $282 million or 22% to $974 million from 2022, primarily driven by lower market volume; growth in servicing income and HELOC revenue as well as higher gain on sale margin partially offset the impact of volume decrease. Total expenses decreased $693 million or 36% to $1.25 billion, primarily driven by cost productivity improvements and lower origination volume; 2023 expenses included $27 million of restructuring charges, lease and other asset impairment charges and accruals related to the expected settlement of outstanding litigation. Annual net loss narrowed $375 million or 61% to $236 million. Adjusted annual net loss declined by $315 million or 69% to $142 million. Fourth quarter 2023 highlights: Year-over-year revenue increased $59 million or 35% to $229 million primarily driven by higher servicing income, gain on sale margin and pull through weighted lock volume. Fourth quarter revenue decreased $37 million or 14% from third quarter 2023, primarily driven by seasonally lower volume partially offset by higher gain on sale margin. Year-over-year expenses decreased $41 million or 12% to $303 million primarily on lower personnel related expenses. Fourth quarter expenses decreased $3 million or 1% from third quarter 2023. During the quarter the company launched a supplemental cost reduction program targeting $120 million of annualized productivity improvements expected to benefit 2024. Through February 29, 2024, the company has confirmed approximately 86% of the planned improvements. Year-over-year net loss decreased from $158 million to $60 million. Quarterly net loss increased by $26 million from the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to seasonality. Year-over-year adjusted net loss decreased from $107 million to $27 million. Quarterly adjusted net loss increased by $1 million from the third quarter of 2023. Company reports cash balance of $661 million and continues to maintain strong liquidity profile. IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- loanDepot, Inc. (NYSE: LDI), (together with its subsidiaries, “loanDepot” or the “Company”), a leading provider of lending solutions that make the American dream of homeownership more accessible and achievable for all, today announced results for the fourth quarter and year-ended December 31, 2023. “loanDepot made substantial progress in 2023, significantly resetting its cost structure and making critical investments in our technology platforms and business processes, which we believe position us to capture the benefits of the eventual rebound in mortgage volumes,” said President and Chief Executive Officer Frank Martell. “We are entering 2024 with a more durable revenue model built around a strong multi-channel origination business and a low cost, high-quality servicing platform that underpins our strategy of becoming a trusted partner for individuals and families on their homeownership journey. We will continue to aggressively pursue automation and productivity programs to support expanded operating leverage and continue to fund reinvestment in solutions that support the increasingly diverse communities that represent a growing number of homebuyers,” Martell added. “During the course of 2023, we reduced our cost structure by $693 million,” said Chief Financial Officer David Hayes. “We expect significant additional benefits from our previously announced $120 million annualized cost reduction program during 2024. Our cost reset has allowed us to maintain a strong liquidity position and at the same time support reinvestment in critical platforms and programs. As the housing and mortgage markets begin to recover, we believe we enter 2024 positioned for success through a relentless focus on delivering against the pillars of Vision 2025.” Fourth Quarter Highlights: Financial Summary Three Months Ended Year Ended ($ in thousands except per share data) (Unaudited) Dec 31, 2023 Sep 30, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 Dec 31, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 Rate lock volume $ 6,417,419 $ 8,295,935 $ 6,933,099 $ 32,155,455 $ 68,553,340 Pull through weighted lock volume(1) 4,407,386 5,685,209 4,196,894 21,475,262 45,164,915 Loan origination volume 5,370,708 6,083,143 6,382,743 22,671,731 53,778,456 Gain on sale margin(2) 2.43 % 2.74 % 1.45 % 2.60 % 1.63 % Pull through weighted gain on sale margin(3) 2.96 % 2.93 % 2.21 % 2.75 % 1.94 % Financial Results Total revenue $ 228,626 $ 265,661 $ 169,655 $ 974,022 $ 1,255,796 Total expense 302,571 305,128 343,735 1,252,330 1,945,773 Net loss (59,771 ) (34,262 ) (157,762 ) (235,512 ) (610,385 ) Diluted loss per share $ (0.16 ) $ (0.09 ) $ (0.46 ) $ (0.63 ) $ (1.75 ) Non-GAAP Financial Measures(4) Adjusted total revenue $ 251,450 $ 266,363 $ 188,501 $ 1,019,714 $ 1,216,041 Adjusted net loss (26,660 ) (25,405 ) (107,156 ) (142,443 ) (457,601 ) Adjusted EBITDA (LBITDA) 14,957 20,497 (86,836 ) 18,907 (446,938 ) (1) Pull through weighted rate lock volume is the principal balance of loans subject to interest rate lock commitments, net of a pull-through factor for the loan funding probability.

(4) See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and a reconciliation of these metrics to their closest GAAP measure. Operational Highlights Quarterly non-volume related expenses increased $4.9 million since the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher restructuring related charges, lease and other asset impairment costs, and legal expenses. Incurred restructuring charges of $3.5 million and lease and other asset impairment charges of $0.8 million during the quarter for a total of $4.3 million, an increase of $2.1 million from the third quarter of 2023. Accrued $3.7 million of legal expenses related to the expected settlement of outstanding litigation compared to $2.0 million accrued during the third quarter of 2023. Pull through weighted lock volume of $4.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of $1.3 billion or 22% from the third quarter of 2023, resulting in quarterly total revenue of $228.6 million, a decrease of $37.0 million, or 14%, over the same period. Loan origination volume for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $5.4 billion, a decrease of $0.7 billion or 12% from the third quarter of 2023. Purchase volume increased to 76% of total loans originated during the fourth quarter, up from 71% of total loans originated during the third quarter of 2023 and flat to 76% of total loans originated during the fourth quarter of 2022. For the three months ending December 31, 2023, our preliminary organic refinance consumer direct recapture rate1 decreased to 58% from the third quarter’s refinance rate of 69%. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 of $59.8 million as compared to net loss of $34.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. Net loss increased quarter over quarter primarily due to revenues decreasing more than the decrease in expenses. Adjusted net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $26.7 million as compared to adjusted net loss of $25.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. Outlook for the first quarter of 2024 Origination volume of between $3.5 billion and $5.5 billion. Pull-through weighted rate lock volume of between $3.5 billion and $5.5 billion. Pull-through weighted gain on sale margin of between 270 basis points and 300 basis points. 1 We define organic refinance consumer direct recapture rate as the total unpaid principal balance (“UPB”) of loans in our servicing portfolio that are paid in full for purposes of refinancing the loan on the same property, with the Company acting as lender on both the existing and new loan, divided by the UPB of all loans in our servicing portfolio that paid in full for the purpose of refinancing the loan on the same property. The recapture rate is finalized following the publication date of this release when external data becomes available.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures To provide investors with information in addition to our results as determined by GAAP, we disclose certain non-GAAP measures to assist investors in evaluating our financial results. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because each measure assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. They facilitate company-to-company operating performance comparisons by backing out potential differences caused by variations in hedging strategies, changes in valuations, capital structures (affecting interest expense on non-funding debt), taxation, the age and book depreciation of facilities (affecting relative depreciation expense), and other cost or benefit items which may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to operating performance. These non-GAAP measures include our Adjusted Total Revenue, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share (if dilutive), and Adjusted EBITDA (LBITDA). We exclude from these non-GAAP financial measures the change in fair value of MSRs and related hedging gains and losses as they represent non-cash, unrealized adjustments resulting from changes in valuation assumptions, mostly due to changes in market interest rates, and are not indicative of the Company’s operating performance or results of operation. We also exclude stock-based compensation expense, which is a non-cash expense, gains or losses on extinguishment of debt and disposal of fixed assets, non-cash goodwill impairment, and other impairment charges to intangible assets and operating lease right-of-use assets, as well as certain costs associated with our restructuring efforts, as management does not consider these costs to be indicative of our performance or results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA (LBITDA) includes interest expense on funding facilities, which are recorded as a component of “net interest income (expense),” as these expenses are a direct operating expense driven by loan origination volume. By contrast, interest expense on our non-funding debt is a function of our capital structure and is therefore excluded from Adjusted EBITDA (LBITDA). Adjustments for income taxes are made to reflect historical results of operations on the basis that it was taxed as a corporation under the Internal Revenue Code, and therefore subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. Adjustments to Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding assumes the pro forma conversion of weighted average Class C shares to Class A common stock. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue, net income, or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure reported by other companies. Some of these limitations are: they do not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA (LBITDA) does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payment on our debt; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or require improvements in the future, and Adjusted Total Revenue, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Adjusted EBITDA (LBITDA) do not reflect any cash requirement for such replacements or improvements; and they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows. Because of these limitations, Adjusted Total Revenue, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share, and Adjusted EBITDA (LBITDA) are not intended as alternatives to total revenue, net income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to the Company, or Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share or as an indicator of our operating performance and should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. We compensate for these limitations by using Adjusted Total Revenue, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share, and Adjusted EBITDA (LBITDA) along with other comparative tools, together with U.S. GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. See below for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures.

Financially, Aligos ended 2023 with $135.7 million in cash, with net losses decreasing compared to the previous year. Positive Aligos made significant advancements in their drug development pipeline for liver and viral diseases in 2023. The company raised $92 million in a private placement financing to support their operations. Aligos completed Phase 2a enabling activities for ALG-055009 and presented positive antiviral activity for chronic hepatitis B. Financially, Aligos ended 2023 with $135.7 million in cash, with net losses decreasing compared to the previous year. Negative Net losses for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, were still significant despite a decrease compared to the previous year. Research and development expenses increased for the three months ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to third-party expenses. General and administrative expenses also increased for the year ended December 31, 2023, mainly due to higher legal and patent attorney costs. Financial Analyst The financial results and business progress reported by Aligos Therapeutics, Inc. indicate a strategic positioning for the company's upcoming clinical trials and product development. The successful closing of a $92 million PIPE investment is a robust indicator of institutional confidence in the company's pipeline, particularly noting the focus on liver and viral diseases which are areas of high unmet medical need. The cash position of $135.7 million suggests a strong liquidity status, providing runway through the end of 2025 according to the company's projections.However, an increase in net losses for the fourth quarter year-over-year, from $21.9 million to $27.9 million, raises concerns about the company's growing expenses despite a decrease in annual net loss from $96.0 million to $87.7 million. This decrease might reflect a strategic reallocation of resources from discontinued programs to more promising ones, such as ALG-055009 and ALG-000184. The focus on R&D is evident with the reported expenses, yet investors should monitor the balance between investment in innovation and the potential for returns on these investments. Medical Research Analyst Aligos Therapeutics' progress in its clinical pipeline, particularly with ALG-055009 and ALG-000184, is noteworthy. ALG-055009's potential as a THR-β agonist for MASH, a condition with limited treatment options, could represent a significant market opportunity. The completion of Phase 2a enabling activities and the anticipation of topline HERALD data by Q4 2024 could be a pivotal moment for the company. For ALG-000184, a small molecule CAM-E for chronic hepatitis B (CHB), the continuation of dosing in the Phase 1a/1b study and planned interim data presentations may offer early insights into its efficacy and safety profile.Furthermore, the development of a pan-coronavirus protease inhibitor, ALG-097558, supported by NIAID, reflects the ongoing need for broad-spectrum antiviral therapies in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. This diversification of the pipeline could mitigate risk and enhance the company's potential market reach. Market Research Analyst Aligos' strategic focus on liver and viral diseases taps into a significant global healthcare market with a growing demand for innovative treatments. The liver disease market, including NASH and hepatitis, is expected to grow substantially, driven by a rising prevalence of obesity and diabetes. Aligos' positioning with ALG-055009 and ALG-000184 could capitalize on this trend, provided the clinical outcomes are favorable. The company's visibility at major conferences like APASL, EASL and AASLD will be key for engaging the medical community and potential partners.Additionally, the pan-coronavirus protease inhibitor program addresses a broader infectious disease market, which has gained heightened awareness and investment following the COVID-19 pandemic. The ongoing Phase 1 study and upcoming presentation at ECCMID could enhance Aligos' profile in the infectious disease space. The diverse portfolio addresses a range of markets, which may appeal to investors looking for biotech companies with multiple shots on goal. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aligos Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALGS, “Aligos”), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapeutics to address unmet medical needs in liver and viral diseases, today reported recent business progress and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. “Last year we built the foundation for a critical 2024 by closing a $92 million PIPE from healthcare-dedicated institutional investors and successfully completing our Phase 2a enabling activities for ALG-055009,” stated Lawrence Blatt, Ph.D., MBA, Chairman & CEO of Aligos Therapeutics. “In addition, we presented unprecedented antiviral activity from our ALG-000184 program for chronic hepatitis B (CHB). With these important accomplishments in hand, we are well positioned to deliver important planned milestones in 2024, which include releasing topline data in subjects with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in the ALG-055009 Phase 2a study (HERALD) and completing Phase 2 enabling activities for ALG-000184 by the end of the year. We look forward to sharing our achievements with our stakeholders throughout this year.” Recent Business Progress Aligos Portfolio of Drug Candidates ALG-055009: Potential best-in-class small molecule THR-β agonist for MASH Phase 2a enabling activities, including completion of supporting nonclinical/Phase 1 studies and manufacturing of drug supply, were completedThe Phase 2a HERALD protocol was filed with the FDA in Q4 2023First subject dosed expected in Q2 2024 and topline HERALD data anticipated in Q4 2024 ALG-000184: Potential best-in-class small molecule CAM-E for CHB Dosing continues in the ongoing Phase 1a/1b ALG-000184-201 study, with multiple subjects now having been dosed for >1 year (total planned dosing duration is 96 weeks). Interim data readouts are planned to be presented this year at the following conferences: Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL), European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)Phase 2 enabling activities, including regulatory interactions and drug supply manufacturing, are underway ALG-097558: Potential best-in-class small molecule pan-coronavirus protease inhibitor The ongoing Phase 1 first in human study is nearing completion of dosing (Q2), with topline data to be presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) Annual Meeting, occurring in April 2024Phase 2 enabling activities are underway with financial support from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $135.7 million as of December 31, 2023, compared with $125.8 million as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, in October 2023, we raised $92.1 million in gross proceeds in a private placement financing, before deducting placement agent’s fees and other expenses. Including the proceeds from the private placement financing, we continue to believe our cash balance provides sufficient cash to fund planned operations through the end of 2025. Net losses for the three months ended December 31, 2023 were $27.9 million or basic and diluted net loss per common share of $(0.22), compared to net losses of $21.9 million or basic and diluted net loss per common share of $(0.51) for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Net losses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $87.7 million or basic and diluted net loss per common share of $(1.36), compared to net losses of $96.0 million or basic and diluted net loss per common share of $(2.25) for the year ended December 31, 2022. Research and development (R&D) expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023 were $22.3 million, compared with $19.1 million for the same period of 2022. The increase was primarily due third party expenses due to the milestone payments made as a result of dosing the first patient in a clinical trial. Total R&D stock-based compensation expense incurred for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $1.5 million, compared with $1.9 million for the same period of 2022. R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $73.0 million, compared with $85.1 million for the same period of 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in third-party expenses mainly related to our discontinued STOPs and ASO programs in 2022, partially offset by increases in our ongoing activities and related expenditures associated with our CAM clinical trial activities and MASH program, as well as the milestone payment to Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven) under its collaboration agreement related to the coronaviruses and the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial. Total R&D stock-based compensation expense incurred for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $6.8 million, compared with $8.0 million for the same period of 2022. General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023 were $6.4 million, compared with $7.1 million for the same period of 2022. The decrease in G&A expenses for this comparative period is primarily due to a decrease in facility costs. Total G&A stock-based compensation expense incurred for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $1.1 million, compared with $1.6 million for the same period of 2022. G&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $30.6 million, compared with $26.4 million for the same period of 2022. This was due to an increase in third-party expenses primarily due to higher legal and patent attorney costs, partially offset by a decrease in facility expenses. Total G&A stock-based compensation expense incurred for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $5.8 million, compared with $6.7 million for the same period of 2022.

Positive Annual recurring revenue increased by 15% year-over-year to $8.7 million. Full-year operating cash flow improved to ($5) million from ($12.8) million. Total revenues for Q4 2023 were $4.7 million, up 2% from the previous year. Gross profit margin % increased to 91% in Q4 2023 from 84% in the previous year. GAAP net loss from continuing operations improved to ($0.5) million in Q4 2023. iCAD's President and CEO, Dana Brown, emphasized progress towards the company's transformation plan. Cash and cash equivalents stood at $21.7 million as of December 31, 2023. The company believes it has sufficient cash resources to fund its current planned operations without the need for additional funding. Negative Total revenues for full-year 2023 decreased by 13%. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA showed a loss of ($0.4) million in Q4 2023. Product revenue decreased by 21.3% year-over-year for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. Financial Analyst The reported Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth of 15% year-over-year for iCAD Inc. is a positive indicator of the company's ability to retain and potentially expand its customer base over time. ARR is a critical metric for companies with a subscription-based revenue model as it provides a more predictable and stable revenue stream. The increase in ARR, coupled with the improvement in operating cash flow from ($12.8) million to ($5) million, suggests that iCAD is moving towards operational efficiency and better cash management.However, the full-year revenue decline of 13% raises concerns about the company's market position and competitive dynamics. While the gross profit margin remains consistent at 85%, indicating stable production costs relative to sales, the drop in product revenue by 21.3% could reflect either a decrease in demand or increased competition. Investors should monitor subsequent quarters to determine if this is an ongoing trend or a one-time fluctuation.The improvement in GAAP Net Loss from continuing operations suggests that the company's cost-cutting measures or operational adjustments are having a positive effect on the bottom line. However, a continuous net loss indicates that the company has not yet reached profitability, which is an essential factor for long-term sustainability. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, iCAD's focus on AI-powered solutions for cancer detection positions the company within a high-growth sector. The healthcare industry's increasing adoption of AI technologies for diagnostic accuracy and efficiency could serve as a tailwind for iCAD's offerings. The reported reading of over 40 million mammograms, with nearly 30% being tomosynthesis, demonstrates the company's significant footprint in the diagnostic imaging market.The gross profit margin of 91% in Q4, up from 84%, is particularly noteworthy as it suggests a strong value proposition and pricing power for iCAD's products and services. However, it is essential to juxtapose this against the overall revenue decline to assess the company's market strategy effectiveness.Given the company's statement about a three-phased transformation plan and investment in growth initiatives, stakeholders should look for signs of innovation and market expansion in future reports. The ability of iCAD to capitalize on its patient-centric mission and leverage its technological advancements will be crucial for its continued growth and market share acquisition. Medical Technology Analyst Within the medical technology sector, iCAD's focus on early cancer detection through AI is a strategic advantage. The high gross profit margins indicate that iCAD's products have substantial intellectual property value and require a lower cost of goods sold relative to their selling price. This is often the case with software and technology-driven solutions, which can scale effectively once developed.The issuance of 1,057,814 shares in at-the-market (ATM) offerings and the sale of Xoft resulting in net cash proceeds of $4.5 million reflect strategic financial moves to bolster the company's cash position. The management's confidence in funding current operations without additional fundraising is a positive signal to investors about the company's financial strategy and liquidity status.For stakeholders, the key will be to monitor how effectively iCAD can translate its technological capabilities into commercial success. The company's ability to drive adoption of its AI-powered solutions in a competitive healthcare market will be critical. Future regulatory approvals and clinical trial outcomes will also play a significant role in shaping the company's trajectory. 03/12/2024 - 04:01 PM Annual Recurring Revenue of $8.7 million, an increase of 15% year-over-yearFull-Year Operating Cash Flow ($5) million vs. ($12.8) million prior yearYear ending cash balance of $21.7M NASHUA, N.H., March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- iCAD, Inc.

However, management believes that in order to understand the Company’s short-term and long-term financial and operational trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of certain non-cash or non-recurring items, when used as a supplement to financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP. These items result from facts and circumstances that vary in frequency and/or impact on continuing operations. Management also uses results of operations before such items to evaluate the operating performance of the Company and compare it against past periods, make operating decisions, and serve as a basis for strategic planning. These non-GAAP financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in the Company’s ongoing business by eliminating certain non-cash expenses and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of the Company’s ongoing business with prior periods more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations or reduce management’s ability to make useful forecasts. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional means of evaluating period-over-period operating performance. In addition, management understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company’s financial and operational performance and comparing this performance to its peers and competitors. Management defines “Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA” as the sum of GAAP Net Loss before provisions for interest expense, other income, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, tax expense, severance, gain on sale of assets, loss on disposal of assets, acquisition and litigation related expenses. Management considers this non-GAAP financial measure to be an indicator of the Company’s operational strength and performance of its business and a good measure of its historical operating trends, in particular the extent to which ongoing operations impact the Company’s overall financial performance. The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of the Company’s GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, the Company’s financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in its financial reporting and investor presentations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Management excludes each of the items identified below from the applicable non-GAAP financial measure referenced above for the reasons set forth with respect to that excluded item: Interest expense: The Company excludes interest expense which includes interest from the facility agreement, interest on capital leases and interest on the convertible debentures from its non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA calculation. Stock-based compensation expense: excluded as these are non-cash expenses that management does not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of the Company’s business, and also because the total amount of expense is partially outside of the Company’s control as it is based on factors such as stock price volatility and interest rates, which may be unrelated to our performance during the period in which the expense is incurred. Amortization and Depreciation: Purchased assets and intangibles are amortized over a period of several years and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after they are acquired. Accordingly, these non-cash items are not considered by management in making operating decisions, and management believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations. Thus, including such charges does not accurately reflect the performance of the Company’s ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred. Severance and Furlough: The Company has incurred severance and furlough expenses in connection with restructuring and in connection with the separation of its former CEO. The Company excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating its continuing business performance as such items can vary significantly and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. In addition, management believes that such items do not have a direct correlation to future business operations. Loss on fair value of convertible debentures. The Company excludes this non-cash item as it is not considered by management in making operating decisions, and management believes that such item does not have a direct correlation to future business operations. Litigation related: These expenses consist primarily of settlement, legal and other professional fees related to litigation. The Company excludes these costs from its non-GAAP measures primarily because the Company believes that these costs have no direct correlation to the core operations of the Company. Loss on extinguishment of debt: The Company excludes this non-cash item as it is not considered by management in making operating decisions, and management believes that such item does not have a direct correlation to future business operations. On occasion in the future, there may be other items, such as loss on extinguishment of debt, significant asset impairments, restructuring charges or significant gains or losses from contingencies that the Company may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. Definitions Starting in the third quarter of 2023, the Company began reporting Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) with each quarterly earnings announcement. The Company’s management believes this is a useful metric for purposes of assessing progress in transitioning to a subscription-based business model. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and does not represent our revenue under U.S. GAAP on an annualized basis, as it is an operating metric that can be impacted by contract start dates, end dates, cancellations, and renewal rates. Subscription ARR is not intended to be a replacement for forecasts of revenue. The following are the variations of ARR the Company intends to present: Total ARR (T-ARR) represents the annualized value of subscription license, maintenance contracts and active cloud services at the end of a reporting period.Maintenance Services ARR (M-ARR) represents the annualized value of active perpetual license maintenance service contracts at the end of the reporting period. Subscription ARR (S-ARR) represents the annualized value of active subscription or term licenses at the end of a reporting period.Cloud ARR (C-ARR) represents the annualized value of active cloud services contracts at the end of a reporting period.

CEO Andrew Toy highlighted the significant progress made in 2023 towards profitability, emphasizing the improvement in Adjusted EBITDA and Insurance MCR, positioning the company for future success in the Medicare Advantage program. Key financial metrics showed growth in Insurance revenue, a decline in Non-Insurance revenue, and improvements in Insurance MCR, reflecting the company's strategic focus on core business strengths. Clover's unique care management platform, including Clover Assistant and Clover Home Care, aims to empower clinicians for early chronic disease management, setting the stage for continued growth in 2024 and beyond. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported improvements in Insurance Medical Cost Ratio (MCR) and Adjusted EBITDA for Clover Health Investments, Corp. indicate a significant operational turnaround. A reduction in MCR from 91.8% to 81.2% year-over-year suggests enhanced efficiency in managing healthcare costs relative to premiums earned. This is a vital metric for investors as it reflects the company's ability to control expenses within its insurance operations, which is crucial for profitability in the insurance sector.Furthermore, the reduction in net loss and the positive trajectory of Adjusted EBITDA, despite a reported net loss, suggest that the company is moving towards operational profitability. The focus on a 'benefit-rich, PPO-first model' and investments in care management platforms like Clover Assistant and Clover Home Care could be driving this improvement. These platforms may contribute to better health outcomes and cost management by facilitating early identification and management of chronic diseases. Healthcare Industry Analyst The shift in Clover Health's business performance can be attributed to strategic initiatives aimed at improving unit economics within the Medicare Advantage program. The company's emphasis on a differentiated approach that leverages technology for clinician empowerment and chronic disease management is reflective of broader industry trends towards value-based care. This approach not only enhances patient care but also aligns with the financial incentives of reducing unnecessary healthcare spending.While the reported decline in Non-Insurance revenue raises questions, the improved Insurance MCR and Adjusted EBITDA demonstrate a potential reallocation of resources towards more profitable and sustainable segments of the business. This realignment could be a response to market demands and regulatory environments that favor efficient, outcome-based healthcare delivery models. Market Research Analyst The guidance for 2024, with an Insurance MCR range of 79% - 83% and up to $20 million of Adjusted EBITDA profitability, suggests management's confidence in maintaining the positive trend. However, it is important to note that the healthcare industry is subject to regulatory changes, competitive pressures and economic fluctuations that could impact these projections. The company's performance relative to competitors and the broader market will be crucial in assessing the sustainability of its growth trajectory and its ability to capitalize on the future of the Medicare Advantage program as projected by the CEO.Investors should also consider the potential impact of the reported Non-Insurance revenue decline on overall business stability. While the focus on insurance operations seems to be yielding positive results, diversification of revenue streams remains an important factor in mitigating risks associated with market volatility. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM Full-year 2023 Insurance MCR improved to 81.2% and fourth quarter MCR to 82.4% Company improves full-year 2023 Net Loss by $126.2 million and full-year Adjusted EBITDA by $245.7 million year-over-year Issues 2024 guidance with Insurance MCR range of 79% - 83% and up to $20 million of Adjusted EBITDA profitability at the high end of the range FRANKLIN, Tenn., March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clover Health Investments, Corp. (NASDAQ: CLOV) (""Clover,"" ""Clover Health"" or the ""Company""), a managed care company focused on physician enablement, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Management will host a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. ET to discuss its operating results and other business highlights. For the fourth quarter 2023, the Company reported revenue of $510.3 million and net loss of $70.5 million, with full-year revenue of $2,033.7 million and net loss of $213.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA during 2023 improved to a loss of $19.1 million in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period loss of $80.0 million, and a full-year loss of $44.7 million as compared to $290.4 million during 2022. Insurance revenue during the fourth quarter grew by 12% to $303.1 million, and grew by 14% to $1,235.8 million for full-year 2023. Insurance MCR also meaningfully improved to 82.4% in the fourth quarter and 81.2% for full-year 2023, as compared to 92.4% in the fourth quarter 2022 and 91.8% for full-year 2022. As expected, Non-Insurance revenue declined year-over-year by 68% in both the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 to $197.9 million and $773.2 million, respectively, and fourth quarter Non-Insurance MCR was 100.2%, bringing full-year 2023 MCR to 99.8%. “We delivered remarkable progress in 2023 on our path to profitability, highlighted by an extraordinary improvement in Adjusted EBITDA since this time last year,” said Clover Health CEO Andrew Toy. “Driving this result is the strength and maturation of the core of our business, where we have been able to improve our Insurance MCR by more than 10 percentage points year-over-year. I believe that our ability to achieve industry-leading unit economics in 2023, within the context of a benefit-rich, PPO-first model, validates our differentiated approach, and positions our business to uniquely thrive in what we believe will be the future of the Medicare Advantage program. We expect to build upon this momentum in 2024 and beyond via our unique care management platform, underpinned by Clover Assistant and Clover Home Care, with a focus to empower clinicians to identify and manage chronic diseases earlier.” Key Company highlights are as follows: Dollars in Millions Q4'23 Q4'22 FY'23 FY'22Insurance revenue $303.1 $270.3 $1,235.8 $1,084.9 Non-Insurance revenue 197.9 622.6 773.2 2,380.1 Total revenue 510.3 898.8 2,033.7 3,476.7 Insurance MCR 82.4% 92.4% 81.2% 91.8%Non-Insurance MCR 100.2 103.6 99.8 103.4 Salaries and benefits plus General and administrative expenses (""SG&A"") (1) $109.9 $124.3 $444.7 $486.6 Adjusted Salaries and benefits plus General and administrative expenses (""Adjusted SG&A"") (non-GAAP) (1)(2) 81.4 84.5 302.0 312.5 Net loss (70.5) (84.2) (213.4) (339.6)Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) (2)(3) (19.1) (80.0) (44.7) (290.4) (1) Salaries and benefits plus General and administrative expenses (""SG&A"") is the sum of Salaries and benefits plus General and administrative expenses presented as the GAAP measure in the consolidated financial statements.(2) Adjusted SG&A (non-GAAP) and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) are non-GAAP financial measures.

Additional information about the Company's non-GAAP financial measures can be found under the caption ""About Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below and in Appendix A.(3) Beginning in the fourth quarter 2023, we updated our definition and presentation of Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) to exclude impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets is now being excluded because it is a new non-cash item, is customarily excluded from Adjusted EBITDA measures, and management believes that impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets does not reflect the Company's underlying fundamentals and it is not reflective of the Company’s operating expenses relating to its core businesses or its actual recurring cash expense. The prior period figure has been revised to conform to the updated definition and presentation. For additional information, see the definition of ""Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)"" in Appendix A. Financial Outlook For full-year 2024, Clover Health is providing its guidance as follows: GuidanceInsurance revenue$1.25 billion - $1.30 billionInsurance MCR79% - 83%Adjusted SG&A (Non-GAAP)(1)$270 million - $280 millionAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)(1)($20) million - $20 million (1) Reconciliations of projected Adjusted SG&A (non-GAAP) to projected SG&A, and projected Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) to Net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measures, are not provided because Stock-based compensation expense, which is excluded from Adjusted SG&A (non-GAAP) and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at this time without unreasonable efforts.

For a detailed explanation of these non-GAAP measures, see Appendix A. CLOVER HEALTH INVESTMENTS, CORP.Appendix AExplanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Non-GAAP Definitions Adjusted EBITDA - A non-GAAP financial measure defined by us as net loss before interest expense, amortization of notes and securities discount, depreciation and amortization, change in fair value of warrants, gain on investment, stock-based compensation expense, premium deficiency reserve benefit, restructuring costs, non-recurring legal expenses and settlements, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, expenses attributable to Seek Insurance Services, Inc., expenses attributable to Character Biosciences, Inc., and gain on extinguishment of note payable. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management team and the board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short and long-term operating plans. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the amounts eliminated in calculating Adjusted EBITDA provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors and others useful information to understand and evaluate our operating results in the same manner as our management and our board of directors. Adjusted SG&A - A non-GAAP financial measure defined by us as total SG&A less Stock-based compensation expense, less non-recurring legal expenses and settlements, less expenses attributable to Seek Insurance Services, Inc., and Character Biosciences, Inc. We believe that Adjusted SG&A provides management, investors, and others a useful view of our operating spend as it excludes non-cash, stock-based compensation and expenses related to investments that management believes do not reflect the Company's core operating expenses. We believe that Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of revenue is useful to management, investors, and others because it allows us to measure our operational leverage as revenue scales.

Our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. They are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to revenue or net loss, as applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other businesses. Our non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include: (i) non-cash compensation is and will remain a key element of our overall long-term incentive compensation package, although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating its ongoing operating performance for a particular period, (ii) our non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect the impact of certain charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of ongoing operations, and (iii) other companies in our industry may calculate our non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. We compensate for these limitations to our non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using our non-GAAP financial measures only for supplemental purposes. Our non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments for items that may not occur in future periods. However, we believe these adjustments are appropriate because the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period, do not directly relate to the ongoing operations of our business and complicate comparisons of our internal operating results and operating results of other peer companies over time. Each of the normal recurring adjustments and other adjustments described in this paragraph help management with a measure of our operating performance over time by removing items that are not related to day-to-day operations or are non-cash expenses.

Management commentary emphasizing transformative year and growth opportunities. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results by Flotek Industries, Inc. demonstrate a significant turnaround from previous years, with a notable transition from a net loss in 2022 to a net income in 2023. This shift is particularly remarkable considering the $67.0 million year-over-year improvement. The increase in full-year revenue by 38% is a robust indicator of the company's growth and could be attributed to strategic initiatives and market conditions favoring Flotek's product offerings.Furthermore, the improvement in adjusted EBITDA, which serves as a proxy for the company's operational profitability excluding non-cash expenses and certain variable costs, suggests efficient cost management and potentially improved operational leverage. Investors might view the resolution of the material weakness and going concern issues from the 2022 audit as a positive sign of strengthened financial controls and stability.The growth in the data analytics segment, with a 47% increase in JP3 revenues, could signal a successful diversification strategy, reducing reliance on traditional revenue streams and tapping into the high-growth data analytics market. This could be seen as a strategic move to insulate the company from volatile commodity prices that typically affect chemical providers in the oil and gas sector. Market Research Analyst The substantial growth in revenue and the turnaround to profitability for Flotek Industries underscore a potentially favorable response from the market. The company's focus on sustainable chemistry and data solutions is likely to resonate with current industry trends towards sustainability and efficiency. Flotek's positioning as a collaborative partner in these areas may lead to increased market share and customer retention.With the upstream completion environment slowing down, the 21% increase in chemistry revenue from external customers indicates that Flotek's offerings are gaining traction despite industry headwinds. This could suggest that their products are not only competitive but also potentially indispensable to their customers' operations.Investors and stakeholders will likely monitor the company's future performance to see if these positive trends continue, especially in light of the recent leadership changes and the strengthening of the senior leadership team. The market will also be interested in how the company plans to sustain and build upon this growth, particularly in its data analytics segment. Legal Expert The resolution of material weakness and going concern issues from the previous year's audit is a critical development for Flotek Industries. It indicates a significant improvement in internal controls over financial reporting. This resolution may restore investor confidence and could potentially lead to a reevaluation of the company's risk profile by credit rating agencies and financial institutions.Additionally, the establishment of an Asset Based Loan (ABL) facility enhances the company's liquidity, providing more flexibility in managing working capital and funding operations or growth initiatives. It is important for the company to maintain compliance with the covenants associated with the ABL to avoid any potential legal or financial repercussions.The appointment of Dr. Ryan Ezell as Chief Executive Officer is another key development. While typically not directly impacting financial metrics, strong leadership is crucial for maintaining corporate governance and executing strategic plans. Investors will likely observe how Dr. Ezell's leadership influences the company's strategic direction and whether it will lead to continued positive results. 03/12/2024 - 04:02 PM HOUSTON, March 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Flotek Industries, Inc.

We also anticipate sustained growth in reservoir centric and international chemistry revenues as we expand our global footprint."" Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2023 Financial Results Revenue: Flotek reported total revenues of $42.2 million for the fourth quarter 2023, which was a decrease of $6.0 million, or 13%, compared to total revenues of $48.2 million for the fourth quarter 2022. The decline in revenue as compared to the fourth quarter 2022 was the result of lower North American land completion activity during the fourth quarter 2023 partially offset by a 28% increase in chemistry revenues from external customers during the fourth quarter 2023 as compared to the 2022 period. Flotek reported total revenues of $188.1 million for the full-year 2023, which was an increase of $52.0 million, or 38%, compared to total revenues of $136.1 million for the full-year 2022. The Company's fourth quarter and full-year 2023 revenues included amounts attributable to the minimum chemistry purchase requirements contained in the ProFrac supply agreement.Gross Profit (Loss): The Company generated gross profit of $9.4 million during the fourth quarter 2023 as compared to a gross loss of $2.1 million for the fourth quarter 2022. The improvement in fourth quarter 2023 gross profit was the result of successful initiatives throughout 2023 to drive cost improvements with respect to freight, logistics and materials, the increase in chemistry revenues from external customers as well as revenue attributable to the minimum chemistry purchase requirements contained in the ProFrac supply agreement.The Company generated gross profit of $24.3 million for the full-year 2023 compared to a gross loss of $6.7 million for the full-year 2022. The improvement in full-year 2023 gross profit was the result of the 38% increase in revenues combined with numerous cost improvements implemented during 2023.Adjusted Gross Profit (Non-GAAP)(1): Flotek generated adjusted gross profit(1) of $10.7 million during the fourth quarter 2023 compared to adjusted gross loss(1) of $0.5 million for the fourth quarter 2022. Adjusted gross profit(1) for the full-year 2023 increased to $28.7 million compared to a loss of $1.9 million for the full-year 2022. Adjusted gross profit(1) excludes non-cash items, primarily amortization of contract assets.Selling, General and Administrative (""SG&A"") Expense: SG&A expense totaled $6.6 million for the fourth quarter 2023 compared to $6.2 million for the fourth quarter 2022. SG&A during the fourth quarter 2022 included a $1.9 million credit related to the reversal of a bonus accrual. SG&A expense totaled $27.9 million for full year 2023 compared to $27.1 million for full-year 2022.Net Income (Loss) and EPS: Flotek reported net income of $2.1 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2023. This compares to a net loss of $19.0 million, or ($1.51) per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2022. Net income for the full-year 2023 was $24.7 million, or ($0.10) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $42.3 million, or ($3.41) per diluted share, for the comparable period of 2022. Net income (loss) for the fourth quarter 2022 and full-year 2023 and 2022 included non-cash gains (losses) on the fair value measurement of convertible notes payable totaling ($8.9) million, $30.0 million, and $0.1 million, respectively.Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)(1): Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $4.0 million in the fourth quarter 2023 as compared to negative $5.1 million in the fourth quarter 2022. Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $1.5 million for full-year 2023 compared to negative $26.2 million for the full-year 2022.(1) See the ""Unaudited Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Items and Non-Cash Items Impacting Earnings"" section in this release for more information, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures. Data Analytics Update Flotek continues to test the next generation version of its proprietary JP3 Verax Near InfraRed measurement system (""JP3""). JP3 represents the foundational technology behind the Company's Data Analytics business, which supports customers through real-time data, monitoring, and visualization across the energy value chain. The new JP3 analyzer is currently undergoing extensive field-trial testing with customer deployment expected by mid-2024. The new unit's engineering advances will facilitate scale and accelerated pace of production along with a reduction in manufacturing costs allowing access to markets that are currently unavailable. The Company's plans for 2024 include maintaining JP3's strong presence in the midstream market, as well as pursuing new opportunities to accelerate penetration into the upstream market. Flotek is currently working with landowner groups to improve production allocations on lease sites and custody transfer locations through JP3's accurate, real-time measurements. This application represents a significant market opportunity in replacing traditional allocation measurement technologies. In addition, the Company is participating in a flare monitoring pilot program with a large upstream operator to demonstrate the use of JP3's technical solution in connection with compliance with recently enacted EPA regulations.

Financial Analyst The declaration of a cash dividend by Dynex Capital, Inc. is a significant indicator of the company's current financial health and its ability to generate positive cash flow. A dividend payment can often signal confidence from the company's management in its profitability and stability. Investors typically view regular and consistent dividends as a positive trait, as they provide a source of passive income.However, the size and sustainability of the dividend are crucial. A $0.13 per common share payout needs to be assessed in the context of the company's earnings per share (EPS) and payout ratio, which is the percentage of earnings paid out as dividends. If the payout ratio is too high, it may not be sustainable in the long run. Conversely, if the ratio is within a reasonable range, it suggests that the company can maintain or potentially increase its dividend in the future without compromising its financial stability. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the announcement of a dividend payment by Dynex Capital, Inc. can impact investor sentiment and the company's stock price. Dividend announcements are often factored into stock valuation models, such as the Dividend Discount Model (DDM), which calculates the present value of a stock based on the expected future dividends discounted back to their present value. An increase or decrease in dividend payments can lead to a reassessment of the company's valuation.It's also important to consider the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the stock price. The yield provides a measure of the income return on an investment, which is particularly attractive to income-focused investors. A competitive dividend yield can make the stock more appealing to this segment of the market, potentially increasing demand and the stock price. 03/12/2024 - 04:01 PM GLEN ALLEN, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Dynex Capital, Inc.

The test is non-invasive and uses a simple saliva sample, aligning with NCCN guidelines and covered by Medicare. CEO believes the addition will drive revenue growth in the second half of the year. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The introduction of MDxHealth's non-invasive genetic prostate cancer test represents a significant advancement in precision diagnostics. This new test aligns with the latest NCCN guidelines, which underscores its clinical relevance. From a research perspective, the ability to assess hereditary risk factors through a non-invasive saliva sample is a leap forward in patient comfort and ease of testing, potentially increasing patient compliance and early detection rates.Given that prostate cancer has a noted genetic component, this test could facilitate earlier and more personalized treatment strategies. The test's coverage by Medicare and many commercial insurance plans not only makes it accessible to a wider patient population but also indicates a level of clinical acceptance that can drive adoption. For stakeholders, the anticipated contribution to revenue and growth in the second half of the year is a critical point, as it suggests confidence in the test's market potential and its alignment with existing reimbursement structures. Financial Analyst MDxHealth's strategic expansion into hereditary prostate cancer testing could be a catalyst for the company's financial performance. By tapping into the established urology sales channel, MDxHealth leverages existing relationships and infrastructure to promote the new test, which may lead to cost-effective market penetration and quicker revenue realization.The CEO's statement projects confidence in the test's potential to contribute to the company's growth in the latter half of the year. Investors should note the alignment with clinical guidelines and insurance coverage, which are often predictors of market acceptance and can drive volume. However, it's essential to monitor the actual adoption rate and the competitive landscape, as these factors will ultimately determine the financial impact of the new test offering. Market Research Analyst Prostate cancer's status as a leading cause of cancer-related death among men creates a substantial market for diagnostic tests, especially those that offer precision and non-invasive methodologies. MDxHealth's new test could satisfy an unmet need within this market by providing a tool for risk stratification and therapy optimization.

(SIGA) reported strong financial results for 2023, with $131 million in product sales and $84 million in pre-tax operating income. The company declared a special cash dividend of $0.60 per share, showing a significant increase over the previous year. SIGA's revenue growth, international sales, and diversification efforts highlight its robust business model and sector leadership. Positive SIGA reported $131 million in product sales and $84 million in pre-tax operating income for 2023, marking a 51% and 96% increase over 2022, respectively. The company declared a special cash dividend of $0.60 per share, higher than the previous year's dividend. SIGA's revenue base diversified with sales to over 25 countries and a joint procurement framework contract with the European Commission's DG HERA. The company repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares of its common stock in 2023. SIGA's financial performance in 2023 showcases its strength, resilience, and growth potential in the public health sector. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in product sales to $131 million, representing a 51% year-over-year growth, is a strong indicator of SIGA Technologies' expanding market presence, particularly in the pharmaceutical sector. The substantial pre-tax operating income growth to $84 million, nearly doubling from the previous year, suggests improved operational efficiency and cost management. The declaration of a special cash dividend of $0.60 per share, up from $0.45 the previous year, is a positive signal to shareholders, reflecting the company's confidence in its financial health and commitment to returning value. Investors will likely scrutinize the sustainability of these financial metrics, considering the historical volatility of pharmaceutical sales and the dependency on government contracts, which can be subject to political and budgetary changes. Market Research Analyst The diversification of SIGA's revenue base, with procurement orders for oral TPOXX from over 25 countries, indicates a strategic move to reduce reliance on any single market. The establishment of a joint procurement framework contract by the European Commission's DG HERA is particularly noteworthy, as it streamlines the ordering process for EU and EFTA countries, potentially leading to more stable and predictable international sales. This development may enhance the company's resilience to market fluctuations and could be a point of interest for investors considering long-term stability and growth potential in the biopharmaceutical sector. Medical Research Analyst The focus on oral TPOXX, particularly its procurement for the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile and international sales, underscores the importance of SIGA's role in public health preparedness. The efficacy and stockpiling of such antiviral medications are critical for national defense against potential bioterrorism threats or outbreaks of diseases like smallpox. The financial results reflect the successful alignment of SIGA's product development with government public health strategies. However, it's important to consider the regulatory and clinical landscape, as any changes could impact future product demand and company performance. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM • Increased Product Sales to $131 Million in 2023 • Grew Pre-tax Operating Income to $84 Million in 2023 • Declared Today a Special Cash Dividend of $0.60 per Share • Corporate Update Conference Call Today at 4:30 PM ET NEW YORK, March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SIGA Technologies, Inc.

As an example of the diversification trend, in October 2023, the Company reported the creation by the European Commission’s DG HERA (Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority) of a joint procurement framework contract under which participating countries from the European Union (EU) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) can efficiently order oral TPOXX. Under this mechanism, $18 million of oral TPOXX was ordered by 13 countries in the fourth quarter, and revenues were recorded for deliveries on substantially of these orders in the fourth quarter or the first two months of 2024. Capital Management Activity: On March 12, 2024, SIGA’s Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $0.60 per share, an increase of $0.15 per share from last year’s special cash dividend.

The EMA and UK approvals include labeling for oral tecovirimat indicating its use for the treatment of smallpox, monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia complications following vaccination against smallpox. The full label is available by clicking here. In September 2018, SIGA signed a contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the office of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for additional procurement and development related to both oral and intravenous formulations of TPOXX. For more information about SIGA, please visit www.siga.com. About Orthopoxviruses Orthopoxvirus, belonging to the family of poxvirus that infect humans, include smallpox, mpox, cowpox and vaccinia. Smallpox, a highly contagious and fatal disease, presents itself as a risk to global health security today given fears of its release accidentally or intentionally as a bioweapon. Mpox virus, similar to smallpox, causes intermittent human infections, painful lesions, and possible case fatalities. Mpox outbreaks have been observed recently in the US, Europe, and Central & West Africa. Whether through natural occurrence or potential bioweapon warfare, orthopox threatens global health. Anti-virals and vaccines serve as possible solutions to address these threats.

Ilya Nikolayev, CEO of Tapinator, commented, ""Year-over-year, we saw a 9% decrease in bookings for our games business, with a 2% decrease in our core Video Poker Classic property. These results can be attributed to: (1) marketing challenges facing the mobile industry based on privacy changes that have made player targeting and tracking more difficult; (2) the continuing decline of our legacy Rapid Launch Games business; and (3) a mobile games industry that continues to mature and which has become increasingly competitive. We have previously communicated that, from a product perspective, our focus is threefold. Continue to execute on our Video Poker Classic roadmap, to further optimize our flagship productPort features that have been proven within Video Poker Classic to Keno Vegas and Lucky Lotto, with the goal of pushing the metrics of these titles closer to that of Video Poker Classic, andLaunch a new mobile game that focuses on the blackjack space, Blackjack Live CasinoWe are pleased to report that we are executing on all three initiatives. We launched Blackjack Live Casino four months ago. The game is a social product at its core and features ""stadium"" gameplay. This means that all online players are dealt the same initial two cards and are then able to independently make decisions on how to play the hand, with the goal of beating the dealer in heads up gameplay. To add to the social experience, the game features real-time, live hosts who engage with players, via voice, and provide commentary on gameplay, strategy, player chat, and more. Currently, live hosts are present 18 hours per day, 7 days per week. We are encouraged by the monetization metrics that we are seeing and are very focused on improving retention which, we believe, is key to success. As noted previously, given the maturation of mobile gaming, we are also seeking alternative growth opportunities for our shareholders within other industries/markets that can offer more significant growth prospects for the Company. We have evaluated numerous other opportunities to drive shareholder value over the past year and continue to evaluate such opportunities."" Non-GAAP Financial Measures*We have provided in this release the non-GAAP financial measures of Bookings and adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to the measures of Revenue and Operating which are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). Management uses Bookings and adjusted EBITDA internally in analyzing our financial results to assess operational performance and liquidity. The presentation of Bookings and adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to Bookings and adjusted EBITDA in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. We believe Bookings and adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors because it allows for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics we use in making operating decisions and because our investors and analysts use them to help assess the health of our business. Below, we have provided reconciliations between our historical Bookings and adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Some limitations of Bookings and adjusted EBITDA are as follows: Bookings do not reflect that we defer and recognize online game revenue over the estimated life of durable virtual goods;Adjusted EBITDA does not include the impact of stock-based expense, impairment of previously capitalized software or intangible assets previously acquired, gain on digital asset dividends & airdrops, gain on sale of digital assets and gain on sale of investments;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax expense;Adjusted EBITDA does not include other income or expenses, which includes foreign exchange gains and losses, interest income or expense, and gain on extinguishment of debt;Adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization of intangible assets and impairment of capitalized software. Although depreciation, amortization, and impairment of capitalized software are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated, amortized, or impaired may have to be replaced in the future; and Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently or not at all, which will reduce their usefulness as a comparative measure.Because of these limitations, you should consider Bookings and adjusted EBITDA, along with other financial performance measures, including Revenue, Net Income (Loss), Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share, Cash Flow from Operations, Operating Income (Loss), and our other financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.

The quoting and trading of the Company's common stock on the OTC Marketplace is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with the Company's operations or business prospects. As a result, there may be volatility in the market price of the shares of the Company's common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTC Marketplace is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on it is often more sporadic than trading of securities listed on a national securities exchange. Accordingly, stockholders may have difficulty reselling any of their shares.

Strong financial position with approximately $272.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of January 31, 2024. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent update on the PACIFIC Study concerning bexicaserin (LP352) is a significant development in the treatment of Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies (DEEs), which includes severe forms like Dravet Syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS). The reported median seizure reduction rates are notably high, especially in DS with a 74.6% reduction. These figures suggest a substantial therapeutic potential for bexicaserin, which could translate into a competitive advantage within the neurological drug market.It is important to consider that the study participants were on multiple anti-seizure medications, indicating that bexicaserin could be effective as an adjunct therapy. This could potentially expand its market to patients who are not adequately managed by current treatments. As the drug advances towards a global Phase 3 program, the anticipation from the DEE community could drive investor interest, given the unmet need in this patient population. Financial Analyst The completion of Longboard Pharmaceuticals' public offering, with gross proceeds of $241.5 million, significantly strengthens the company's financial position. With an increase in cash reserves to approximately $272.4 million, Longboard is well-capitalized to fund its upcoming clinical trials and R&D activities. The increase in R&D expenses by 26.3% year-over-year reflects the company's commitment to advancing its pipeline.Investors should note the strategic allocation of capital towards the development of bexicaserin and LP659, indicating a clear focus on neurological diseases with high unmet medical needs. This focus could potentially lead to high-value assets if the drugs prove to be effective and safe in later-stage trials. However, the inherent risks of clinical development must be acknowledged, as any setbacks could impact the company's financial health and stock performance. Market Research Analyst The neurological drug market, particularly for DEEs, is marked by a small number of highly specialized treatments, which often come with a high cost. Longboard's bexicaserin shows promise in addressing this niche but critical area. The company's progress, including the preparation for an End of Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA, positions it favorably within the industry.Considering the rarity of DEEs and the specificity of bexicaserin's target, the drug's market penetration will largely depend on its clinical efficacy and safety profile. The positive topline data from the PACIFIC Study positions Longboard to potentially capture a significant share of this market. However, the company must navigate the complex regulatory landscape and manage market expectations carefully, as the success of Phase 3 trials is essential for commercialization. 03/12/2024 - 04:01 PM Bexicaserin (LP352) Phase 1b/2a PACIFIC Study positive topline data in participants with Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies (DEEs) was reported in January Announcing an update to the primary efficacy endpoint data previously reported in January, which show further improvement in seizure reductions and no change in the reported safety results – bexicaserin achieved a median seizure reduction of 59.8% in countable motor seizures compared to 17.4% in the placebo group across the DEE study population. A median seizure reduction of 74.6% in Dravet Syndrome (DS), 50.8% in Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) and 65.5% in DEE Other was achieved PACIFIC data to be presented at medical meetings in Q2 2024 Preparing for End of Phase 2 Meeting with regulators and conducting start-up activities for bexicaserin’s global Phase 3 program; expect to initiate the Phase 3 program by YE 2024 LP659 first-in-human Phase 1 single-ascending dose (SAD) study topline data expected Q2 2024 Completed public offering of common stock with gross proceeds of $241.5 million LA JOLLA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Longboard Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: LBPH), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, transformative medicines for neurological diseases, today provided a corporate update and reported full year 2023 financial results. “I am extremely proud of what our team has accomplished starting with the immense effort that went into the PACIFIC Study in participants with DEEs. We are impressed with the data in this study showing evidence of a potentially clinically meaningful benefit for both overall median seizure reduction and seizure reduction across all subgroups for Dravet, LGS and DEE Other. We are motivated by the enthusiasm and anticipation from the DEE community for our Phase 3 program and look forward to providing additional details later in the year. With the completion of our recent financing, we believe we are well positioned to deliver on key milestones later this year, including presenting additional topline and open-label extension data from PACIFIC, conducting our End of Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA, and initiating our global Phase 3 program. We appreciate the tremendous support from our existing and new shareholders who play an integral part in the continued success of Longboard. “We also look forward to Phase 1 topline SAD data next quarter from our second clinical-stage asset, LP659, an oral, centrally acting, highly selective S1P receptor modulator,” stated Kevin R. Lind, Longboard’s President and Chief Executive Officer. PACIFIC STUDY UPDATE In January 2024, we announced positive topline data from the Phase 1b/2a PACIFIC Study evaluating bexicaserin (LP352) in 52 participants with a broad range of DEEs, including DS (4), LGS (29) and other DEEs (19). Of the 52 participants enrolled in the study, 43 participants were randomized to bexicaserin (DS=4, LGS=24, DEE Other=15) and 9 to placebo (DS=0, LGS=5, DEE Other=4). Of note, results were on top of current standard of care; participants were typically on 3-4 other anti-seizure medications. Following our review of the full data set, we are announcing an update to the previously reported primary efficacy endpoint data. The updated data, which show even further improvements in seizure reductions and do not change the reported safety results, reflect corrections made by the study’s contract research organization to their statistical programming errors. The following table outlines the revisions: Revised Previously Reported Median percent change from baseline in countable motor seizure frequency: Bexicaserin Placebo Delta Bexicaserin Placebo Delta Overall 59.8% 17.4% 42.4% 53.3% 20.8% 32.5% DS 74.6% N/A N/A 72.1% N/A N/A LGS 50.8% 17.4% 33.4% 48.1% 20.8% 27.3% DEE Other 65.5% 32.2% 33.3% 61.2% 32.6% 28.6% UPCOMING MILESTONES: Bexicaserin (LP352), an oral, centrally acting, 5-HT2C superagonist in development for the potential treatment of seizures associated with DEEs PACIFIC data to be presented at medical meetings in Q2 2024 PACIFIC open-label extension (OLE) data expected in H2 2024 100% of PACIFIC completers entered into the OLE study Preparing for our End of Phase 2 Meeting with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and aligning with other regulatory agencies Planning for Phase 3 initiation before YE 2024 LP659, an oral, centrally acting, S1P receptor subtypes 1 and 5 (S1P1,5) modulator in development for rare neuroinflammatory conditions Phase 1 SAD topline data expected in Q2 2024 FULL YEAR 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS: Balance Sheet Highlights At December 31, 2023, Longboard’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were approximately $48.5 million. On January 8, 2024, we completed a public offering of 11,500,000 shares of common stock and received gross proceeds of $241.5 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $14.5 million and offering expenses of $0.5 million. As of January 31, 2024, Longboard’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were approximately $272.4 million. Operating Results Research and development expenses were $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $9.2 million or 26.3%, compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The net increase of $9.2 million is primarily related to increases of $6.0 million in preclinical and clinical trial expenses related to bexicaserin, $2.7 million in personnel-related expenses, $0.5 million in other preclinical programs and early stage research expenses and $0.2 million of other miscellaneous expenses, offset by a decrease of $0.3 million in preclinical and clinical trial expenses related to LP659.

The company plans to move towards Phase 3 trials by the end of the year.","Crinetics Announces Positive Topline Results from Phase 2 Trial of Paltusotine for the Treatment of Carcinoid Syndrome Rhea-AI Impact (High) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags clinical trial Rhea-AI Summary Crinetics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CRNX) announced positive topline results from its Phase 2 study of paltusotine for carcinoid syndrome. The study showed rapid and sustained reductions in flushing episodes and bowel movements, with overall positive patient outcomes. The company plans to move towards Phase 3 trials by the end of the year. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent announcement by Crinetics Pharmaceuticals regarding the positive results of their Phase 2 study for paltusotine is a matter of substantial interest from a medical research perspective. The reported efficacy in reducing the frequency and severity of flushing episodes and bowel movements in patients with carcinoid syndrome could signal a significant advancement in treatment options for this patient population. The 63% reduction in mean flushing frequency and 60% reduction in excess bowel movement frequency are particularly noteworthy, as these symptoms can be highly debilitating.From a pharmacokinetic standpoint, the consistency of paltusotine's profile with prior studies suggests a predictable and manageable treatment regimen may be possible. This is crucial for patient adherence and long-term management of chronic conditions like carcinoid syndrome. Additionally, the absence of severe or serious adverse events aligns with industry expectations for safety profiles at this stage of clinical development.It is also important to consider the potential impact of biomarker levels, such as serotonin and 5HIAA, which are indicative of the biochemical effect of paltusotine and could correlate with clinical outcomes. These biomarkers are critical in understanding the drug's mechanism of action and in predicting long-term benefits and risks. Financial Analyst The positive outcome of the Phase 2 trial for paltusotine could have a significant impact on Crinetics Pharmaceuticals' market valuation. Investors often react favorably to successful clinical trial milestones, particularly when a drug demonstrates potential in treating conditions with unmet medical needs. The move towards a Phase 3 trial, as indicated by the company's engagement with the FDA, represents a critical step in the drug's development pathway and could lead to increased investor confidence.As the company prepares for Phase 3 initiation by the end of the year, there may be financial implications such as the need for additional funding, which could lead to stock dilution or partnerships. However, the promise of a new treatment option for carcinoid syndrome may also attract potential licensing deals or acquisitions, especially if the drug continues to show a favorable safety and efficacy profile.It is essential to monitor how the stock market responds to these developments, considering both the immediate surge in interest and the long-term prospects of paltusotine's commercial success. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and the success of clinical trials is one of the most significant drivers of a company's financial health and stock performance. Economist From an economic standpoint, the development of new treatments like paltusotine has implications for the broader healthcare market. If approved, paltusotine could lead to cost savings for healthcare systems by reducing the need for more expensive or invasive treatments. Additionally, the improvement in quality of life for patients could translate to increased productivity and reduced absenteeism, which has positive economic externalities.However, the pricing strategy for paltusotine will be a key factor in its market penetration and overall economic impact. Pharmaceutical pricing is a complex issue that involves considerations of research and development costs, the value provided to patients and the competitive landscape. Crinetics Pharmaceuticals will need to balance the need to recoup their investment with the demand for affordable healthcare solutions.Moreover, the potential approval and market entry of paltusotine may incentivize further innovation in the treatment of endocrine diseases and endocrine-related tumors, potentially leading to a more dynamic and competitive market. This could have long-term implications for the pharmaceutical industry and healthcare providers, fostering an environment that encourages the development of new and improved therapies. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM Paltusotine Treatment Demonstrated Rapid and Sustained Reductions in Frequency and Severity of Flushing Episodes and Bowel Movements Paltusotine was Generally Well-Tolerated and Showed an Overall PK Profile Consistent with Prior Studies Results Confirm Initial Positive Data Previously Reported Management to Host a Conference Call Today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time SAN DIEGO, March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Crinetics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: CRNX) a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for endocrine diseases and endocrine-related tumors, today announced positive topline results from its open-label Phase 2 carcinoid syndrome study of paltusotine, an oral, once-daily investigational compound being developed for the treatment of acromegaly and carcinoid syndrome. “We are very pleased that these results from our Phase 2 study of paltusotine in carcinoid syndrome confirm our decision to move expeditiously toward Phase 3,” said Scott Struthers, Ph.D., founder and chief executive officer of Crinetics. “These results highlight the potential of paltusotine to deliver significant benefits to patients living with the debilitating symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. We plan to engage with the FDA to align on a Phase 3 study design and have begun preparations to enable the initiation of a Phase 3 program by the end of the year.” Key Highlights from the Phase 2 Study: The Phase 2 trial was a randomized, open-label, parallel group, multi-center study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of paltusotine in people living with carcinoid syndrome. A total of 36 participants were randomized to receive either 40 mg (n=18) or 80 mg (n=18) of paltusotine for 8 weeks, with the ability to dose titrate based on tolerability or inadequate control of symptoms during the first four weeks of treatment. Six participants in the 40 mg group increased their dose to 80 mg, and 3 participants in the 80 mg group increased to 120 mg. Thirty patients completed the randomized treatment phase, with 1 patient from the 40 mg group and 5 patients from the 80 mg group discontinuing treatment. Twenty-six of the 30 participants who completed the randomized treatment phase enrolled in the long-term extension phase of the study. Results demonstrated: Rapid and sustained reductions in flushing episodes and bowel movement (BM) 63% reduction in mean flushing frequency for patients with >1/day at baseline (n=24; p<0.0001)60% reduction in mean excess BM frequency (defined as daily bowel movements above the upper limit of normal, 3/day) in patients with >3/day at baseline (n=16; p=0.02)61% reduction in mean flushing severity (n=31; p<0.0001) and 64% reduction in mean BM urgency (n=31; p<0.0001)Reductions in frequency and severity of symptoms were observed within 2 weeks of paltusotine treatment and sustained through 8 weeks in both naïve/untreated patients and those switching from prior somatostatin receptor ligand (SRL) therapy Overall pharmacokinetic profile of paltusotine in patients with carcinoid syndrome was consistent with expectations from healthy volunteersPaltusotine was generally well-tolerated with a safety profile consistent with prior clinical studies: There were no treatment related severe or serious adverse events (AEs)The most frequently reported AEs included diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea and headacheAE findings were similar across 40 mg and 80 mg dosing groups Levels of biomarkers serotonin and 5HIAA provide additional evidence of paltusotine activity in carcinoid syndrome “I am excited about the clinical improvements that paltusotine demonstrated for patients with carcinoid syndrome in this study,” said Aman Chauhan, M.D., Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami and an investigator on the study. “There is a critical need for better treatment options for patients with neuroendocrine tumors who experience carcinoid syndrome. The results from this study of paltusotine are highly encouraging and I look forward to the next stage in its development.” Data Review Conference Call Crinetics will hold a conference call and live webcast today, Tuesday, March 12 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the results from the Phase 2 study.

About the Phase 2 StudyThe Phase 2 study is a randomized, open-label, parallel group, multi-center study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of paltusotine in people living with carcinoid syndrome. This study consists of a randomized treatment phase followed by a long-term extension phase. A total of 36 patients with documented carcinoid syndrome requiring medical therapy were randomized to receive either 40 mg or 80 mg of daily oral paltusotine for 8 weeks. For additional information, please visit clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05361668). About Carcinoid SyndromeCarcinoid syndrome is found in approximately 20% of patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). NETs are a rare, slow-growing type of cancer that arise most often in the digestive tract. When these tumors metastasize to the liver, carcinoid syndrome can occur and is most commonly characterized by diarrhea and flushing. While injectable depot somatostatin receptor ligand (SRL) therapies are mainstay treatments for carcinoid syndrome, these injections are associated with considerable treatment burden and offer inadequate relief of carcinoid syndrome symptoms for many patients. About PaltusotinePaltusotine is the first oral, once-daily selectively-targeted somatostatin receptor type 2 (SST2) agonist and is currently in investigational Phase 3 studies for acromegaly and a Phase 2 study for carcinoid syndrome. It was designed by the Crinetics’ discovery team to provide an efficacious and convenient once-daily option for people living with acromegaly and carcinoid syndrome. In Phase 2 studies and the recently completed PATHFNDR-1 Phase 3 study, paltusotine maintained IGF-1 levels in acromegaly patients who switched from monthly injectable medications to paltusotine. IGF-1 is the primary biomarker endocrinologists use to manage acromegaly patients. Results from the Phase 2 study in carcinoid syndrome further support paltusotine’s potential use beyond acromegaly. About Crinetics Pharmaceuticals Crinetics Pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel therapeutics for endocrine diseases and endocrine-related tumors. Paltusotine, an investigational, first-in-class, oral somatostatin receptor type 2 (SST2) agonist, is in Phase 3 clinical development for acromegaly and in Phase 2 clinical development for carcinoid syndrome associated with neuroendocrine tumors. Crinetics has demonstrated pharmacologic proof-of-concept in a Phase 1 clinical study for CRN04894, an investigational, first-in-class, oral ACTH antagonist, that is currently in Phase 2 clinical studies for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia and Cushing’s disease. All of the company’s drug candidates are orally delivered, small molecule new chemical entities resulting from in-house drug discovery efforts, including additional discovery programs addressing a variety of endocrine conditions such as hyperparathyroidism, polycystic kidney disease, Graves’ disease, thyroid eye disease, diabetes and obesity.

Financial Analyst The reported financial results from Performant Financial Corporation indicate a significant upturn in their fourth quarter performance, particularly in healthcare revenues which have seen a 12% growth. This is a substantial figure in the context of the healthcare payment integrity services industry, indicating that the company is effectively capitalizing on its commercial client base. The adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income for both the fourth quarter and the full year show improvements, signaling better operational efficiency and cost management.However, there is a notable full-year net loss, which investors should examine closely. Despite the positive quarterly results, the annual figures suggest that there may be underlying challenges that could affect future profitability. The company's investment in technology and sales to scale operations, as well as the secured $25M revolver, are strategic moves that could lead to sustained growth, but these require careful monitoring to ensure they translate into long-term profitability. Market Research Analyst Performant Financial Corporation's focus on healthcare payment integrity services places it in a sector with increasing demand due to the complex nature of healthcare billing and the need for cost containment. The reported growth in healthcare revenues, particularly from commercial clients, reflects a strong market position and an effective strategy in acquiring new contracts, such as with New York state Medicaid.Introducing full-year revenue guidance for 2024 provides a transparent outlook for stakeholders and can be seen as a confidence signal from the management. However, the protest of the New York state Medicaid RAC contract introduces an element of uncertainty that should be tracked, as it could have implications for projected revenues and market expansion. Legal Expert The mention of the New York state Medicaid RAC contract being under protest by the incumbent raises legal considerations that could impact Performant Financial Corporation's future revenue streams. While such disputes are not uncommon in government contracting, the outcome of this protest could either validate the company's growth strategy in the government sector or result in delays and potential loss of revenue. Stakeholders should be aware of the legal risks associated with government contracts and the impact they can have on a company's financial projections and stock performance. 03/12/2024 - 04:03 PM PLANTATION, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Performant Financial Corporation (Nasdaq: PFMT), a leading provider of healthcare payment integrity services, today reported the following financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023: Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights Total revenues of $32.6 million, compared to $29.2 million in the prior year period Healthcare revenues of $31.1 million, compared to $26.0 million in the prior year period Net income of $1.3 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $0.2 million, or $0.00 per diluted share, in the prior year period Adjusted EBITDA of $4.5 million, compared to $2.3 million in the prior year period Adjusted net income of $3.6 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the prior year period Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights Total revenues of $113.7 million, compared to $109.2 million in the prior year period Healthcare revenues of $106.4 million, compared to $94.7 million in the prior year period Net loss of $7.5 million, or $(0.10) per diluted share, compared to $6.5 million, or $(0.09) per diluted share in the prior year period Adjusted EBITDA of $3.4 million, compared to $0.9 million in the prior year period Adjusted net loss of $3.8 million, or $(0.05) per diluted share, compared to adjusted net loss of $5.2 million, or $(0.07) per diluted share, in the prior year period Fourth Quarter 2023 Results Healthcare revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $31.1 million, up from $26.0 million in the prior year period.

In terms of EBITDA, we anticipate full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA in the range of $4M to $5M, which is inclusive of the investment expected to implement the New York state Medicaid RAC contract as well as other investments aimed at improving scale and efficiency.” Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this press release, to supplement our consolidated financial statements, the Company presents adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share. These measures are not in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP) and accordingly reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income (loss) to net income (loss) determined in accordance with US GAAP are included in the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Results” table at the end of this press release. We have included adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income (loss) in this press release because they are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to prepare and approve our annual budget. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income (loss) provide useful information to investors and analysts in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Our use of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income (loss) has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under US GAAP. In particular, many of the adjustments to our US GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items, specifically interest, tax and depreciation and amortization expenses, equity-based compensation expense and certain other non-operating expenses, that are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future. In addition, these measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. In regard to forward looking non-GAAP guidance, we are not able to reconcile the forward-looking non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA measure to the closest corresponding GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of certain significant items. These items include, but are not limited to, impacts associated with interest expense, and depreciation and amortization expenses.

ASLAN Pharmaceuticals Announces $5 Million Registered Direct Offering,2024-03-12T18:34:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"ASLAN Pharmaceuticals (ASLN) announces a registered direct offering and concurrent private placement of 5,000,000 American Depositary Shares at $1.00 per ADS, with additional unregistered warrants. This move aims to raise capital for the company's development of innovative treatments in the immunology field.","ASLAN Pharmaceuticals Announces $5 Million Registered Direct Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary ASLAN Pharmaceuticals (ASLN) announces a registered direct offering and concurrent private placement of 5,000,000 American Depositary Shares at $1.00 per ADS, with additional unregistered warrants. This move aims to raise capital for the company's development of innovative treatments in the immunology field. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst ASLAN Pharmaceuticals' recent announcement regarding a registered direct offering and concurrent private placement of warrants is a significant capital-raising event. The offering price of $1.00 per ADS suggests a strategic move to attract investment by potentially offering shares at a discount, a common practice to incentivize immediate capital influx. The issuance of warrants, exercisable immediately at the same price, introduces a future potential for dilution but also indicates a vote of confidence from investors willing to commit to a longer-term horizon.From a financial perspective, the proceeds from this offering could bolster the company's balance sheet, providing necessary funds for ongoing clinical trials or to accelerate pipeline development. However, the impact on existing shareholders must be considered, as dilution can lead to earnings per share (EPS) reduction in the short term. The long-term implications hinge on the company's ability to utilize these funds effectively to drive growth and create shareholder value. Market Research Analyst The biopharmaceutical sector is highly competitive, with a focus on innovation and speed to market. ASLAN Pharmaceuticals' move to secure additional funding through a direct offering and private placement of warrants can be seen as an effort to maintain a competitive edge in the immunology space. The industry-specific context here is the high cost and lengthy timelines associated with bringing new treatments through clinical trials and eventually to market.Market reaction to such offerings can vary, with investors weighing the potential for future growth against the immediate dilution of their holdings. The pricing of the ADSs will be compared against industry benchmarks for similar offerings. If the price is deemed favorable, it could attract a positive market response, whereas a significant discount might raise concerns about the company's valuation or its prospects. Medical Research Analyst In the realm of clinical-stage biopharmaceuticals, funding is a lifeline for the progression of drug candidates. The capital raised through this offering is likely earmarked for the advancement of ASLAN Pharmaceuticals' immunology-focused pipeline. The success of these candidates in clinical trials will be critical in determining the long-term return on investment for those participating in the offering.It's important to scrutinize the company's current stage of development and the therapeutic potential of its drug candidates. If the company's pipeline shows promise, the investment could lead to significant advancements in treatment options for patients and, consequently, substantial returns for investors. However, the inherent risks of clinical trials mean that the outcomes are uncertain and the investment could be at risk if trials do not yield the expected results. 03/12/2024 - 02:34 PM SAN MATEO, Calif. and SINGAPORE, March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ASLAN Pharmaceuticals Ltd.

The successful capital raise will enable the company to potentially expedite their biologics' development and clinical trials, which is crucial in a sector where the speed of innovation is often a key differentiator.Investors and stakeholders within the biotechnology sector will be particularly interested in the company's next steps, as the allocation of the new funds towards their pipeline can significantly accelerate the time to market for their therapies, provided that clinical results are favorable. The impact of this funding on Apogee's operational capabilities and the strategic implications for its competitors are areas of interest. Market Research Analyst Apogee's upsized public offering may have broader implications for the biotech sector, especially for companies specializing in inflammatory and immunological diseases. The successful raise suggests a buoyant market for biotech investments, which could encourage similar firms to consider public offerings or follow-on financings to secure capital for their operations.The pricing of the shares at $62.00 also reflects investor sentiment and valuation benchmarks within the biotech industry. It will be important to observe how this capital injection influences Apogee's market position relative to its peers and whether this move prompts a reevaluation of market valuations for other players in the space. 03/12/2024 - 04:01 PM SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. and WALTHAM, Mass., March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apogee Therapeutics, Inc.

Divested non-core businesses, reducing $15 million in costs for FY 2024. Revealed new AI-powered Personal Cloud Platform with advanced features. Appointed Kevin Rendino to the Board of Directors for financial expertise. Cloud subscriber growth of 9% and recurring revenue at 88% for Q4 2023.

Financial Analyst The reported financial results from Synchronoss Technologies Inc. indicate a pivotal shift in the company's strategy, with a successful transition to a pure-play cloud business model. The revenue consistency year-over-year, despite divesting non-core businesses, suggests a stable financial position. The reported gross margin increase and positive net cash flow reflect improved operational efficiency. However, investors should note the flat revenue growth and the reported net loss, which increased significantly year-over-year due to the divestiture costs. The commitment to an aggressive adjusted EBITDA margin for 2024 is ambitious, considering the current economic climate and the competitive nature of the cloud industry. Market Research Analyst The launch of the 'Anshin Data Box' with SoftBank marks a significant expansion in the Japanese market and indicates Synchronoss's ability to adapt and scale internationally. The cloud market is growing and partnerships with Tier One customers like SoftBank can provide a competitive edge. However, the company's future growth is contingent on its ability to maintain this momentum and innovate in a market where customer demands and technology are rapidly evolving. The focus on AI-powered features and Enhanced Plans could cater to the increasing demand for personalized and intelligent cloud solutions. Technology Industry Analyst Synchronoss's strategic realignment to focus solely on high-margin cloud solutions is a reflection of the broader industry trend towards specialized cloud services. The company's emphasis on AI-powered enhancements and streamlined onboarding processes suggests an alignment with industry best practices for user engagement and retention. However, the technology sector is known for its rapid pace of change and Synchronoss's ability to sustain growth will depend on continuous innovation and its capacity to stay ahead of emerging trends in cloud technologies. 03/12/2024 - 04:05 PM Completes Strategic Transformation into a Pure-Play Cloud Company Launches SoftBank Personal Cloud in Q4, Expanding Global Reach of Cloud Platform Q4 Revenue of $41.4 Million Includes Year-Over-Year Cloud Growth and Exceeds Expectations Company Reaffirms 2024 Guidance BRIDGEWATER, N.J., March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Synchronoss Technologies Inc. (“Synchronoss” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: SNCR), a global leader and innovator in personal Cloud platforms, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. On October 31, 2023, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to divest its Messaging and NetworkX businesses. As such, unless otherwise noted, all financial metrics herein represent continuing operations, except for the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, which are presented for the whole company. During the fourth quarter of 2023 there was a change in the capital structure due to a reverse stock split, which decreased the number of common shares outstanding. The Company retroactively adjusted the computations of basic and diluted EPS for all periods presented on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Fourth Quarter and Recent Operational Highlights Exceeded the upper end of previously provided guidance ranges for 2023 revenue and adjusted EBITDA, delivering $164.2 million and $31.4 million, respectively. Additionally, the Company achieved positive net cash flow in 2023.Launched Synchronoss Personal Cloud as Anshin Data Box with SoftBank, further expanding the Company’s global footprint in the Japanese market and showcasing the adaptability and appeal of its Personal Cloud offerings in the global marketplace.Successfully executed on the strategic divestiture of the non-core Messaging and NetworkX businesses, realizing the Company’s transformation to exclusively focus on providing its industry-leading, high-margin personal Cloud solution to the global marketplace.Following the divestiture, the Company immediately removed $15 million in annualized FY 2024 costs from the go-forward Cloud business. These cost reductions not only enhance operational efficiency but also recalibrate the financial framework, setting a new profitability baseline with expectations of achieving gross margins greater than 75% and adjusted EBITDA margins surpassing 25% in 2024.Unveiled the new version of the “AI-powered” Personal Cloud Platform, which includes advanced features and capabilities that leverage artificial intelligence to enhance user experience and functionality.Appointed Kevin Rendino to the Board of Directors, bolstering the Company’s leadership team as a significant shareholder with deep financial and capital markets expertise. Management Commentary“As we reflect on 2023, Synchronoss has emerged with a clear strategic focus, a simplified financial profile, and more profitable, aligned operations, that are now exclusively dedicated to providing high-value Personal Cloud solutions to the global marketplace,” stated Jeff Miller, President and CEO of Synchronoss. “Our transformation, culminating with the divestiture of the Messaging and NetworkX businesses in the fourth quarter of 2023, positions us to leverage the high-margin nature of our Cloud business for enhanced cash flow generation. This milestone shift has streamlined our operations and solidified our foundation for growth and operational excellence moving forward. “In 2024 we plan to capitalize on our strengths: enhancing subscriber growth with our Tier One customers and further innovating our Cloud solutions to deliver compelling value. These efforts, combined with our disciplined approach to cost management, pave the way for substantial financial progress. Our recent launch of Anshin Data Box, in collaboration with SoftBank, has exceeded initial expectations. This success further signifies the strength and adaptability of our Cloud offerings, and opens avenues for growth with current and potential partners worldwide. We also recently unveiled significant enhancements to our Synchronoss Personal Cloud platform, including AI-powered photo editing features, Enhanced Plans for tailored subscriber offerings, and a streamlined onboarding process. Our refined focus and strategic advancements have permeated our operations with a new level of efficiency and purpose, setting the stage for Synchronoss to grow as a distinguished leader in Cloud technologies.” Key Performance Indicators (""KPIs"") Cloud subscriber growth of approximately 9% continued the Company’s ongoing performance of year-over-year subscriber growth.Quarterly recurring revenue was 88.0% of total revenue, consistent with 89.5% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2023. GAAP revenue breakdown by product is included below. Given the divestiture of the NetworkX and Messaging businesses in Q4 2023, such detailed revenue segmentation will become obsolete.

Total revenue was $41.4 million, consistent with $41.3 million in the prior year period. The revenue performance was the result of growth in Cloud subscribers, offset by the expiration of legacy contracts recorded in fourth quarter of 2022 in the NetworkX and Messaging product sets.Gross profit increased 2.5% to $26.5 million (63.9% of total revenue) from $25.8 million (62.5% of total revenue) in the prior year period. Gross margins increased as a result of lower cost of revenues associated with a higher concentration of Cloud revenue to total revenue. This effect was partially offset by restructuring costs as well as increased depreciation and amortization associated with capitalized software development.Income (loss) from operations was $0.2 million, a significant improvement from a loss of $(5.8) million in the prior year period. This change was largely due to a $7.9 million reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses associated with the prior year adjustment to contingent consideration and the impact from the sale and product sunsetting of non-strategic assets in 2022. This was partially offset by $3.6 million in restructuring charges related to the divestiture in fourth quarter of 2023.Net loss was $(35.0) million, or $(3.56) per share, compared to $(15.9) million, or $(1.66) per share, in the prior year period. Net loss from continuing operations was $(11.8) million, or $(1.46) per share, compared to $(16.2) million, or $(1.92) per share, in the prior year period. Net loss from discontinued operations was $(20.6) million, or $(2.10) per share, compared to net income of $2.5 million, or $0.26 per share, in the prior year period. The increase in net loss was primarily due to the loss on the divestiture of Messaging and NetworkX.Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP metric reconciled below) increased 127% to $10.0 million (24.1% of total revenue) from $4.4 million (10.7% of total revenue) in the prior year period. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily attributable to cost-saving initiatives executed throughout the year.Cash and cash equivalents were $24.6 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $17.6 million1 at September 30, 2023 and $21.9 million2 from continuing and discontinued operations at December 31, 2022. In Q4 2023, free cash flow was $(4.4) million and adjusted free cash flow was $1.4 million. For the full year, free cash flow improved to $(1.0) million from $(3.8) million in 2022, and adjusted free cash flow improved to $14.8 million from $6.1 million in 2022. The Company did not receive additional tax refunds during the period, leaving its remaining balance due at approximately $28 million, which is expected to be received in the coming quarters. 1 Inclusive of $3.5 million cash from discontinued operations.2 Inclusive of $3.6 million cash from discontinued operations.

Total revenue decreased (5.5)% to $164.2 million from $173.8 million in the prior year. The change in full-year revenue was primarily due to the expected runoff of deferred revenue recognized in the first half of 2022 and revenue recognized from the DXP and Activation assets prior to their divestiture in 2022. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by continued Cloud subscriber growth and professional services associated with the launch of SoftBank.Gross profit decreased (7.6)% to $105.8 million (64.4% of total revenue) from $114.5 million (65.9% of total revenue) in the prior year, due to deferred revenue run-off in the first half of the prior year and a legacy product sunsetting in 2022. An upturn in gross profit and margins was observed in the latter half of 2023, driven by a growing share of Cloud revenue, indicating an improving trend in gross margin and profit performance following the strategic shift away from legacy products.(Loss) income from operations was $(10.6) million compared to $0.3 million in 2022. The increase in operating loss was primarily the result of the changes in revenue, restructuring expenses, and impairments on a note receivable in the third quarter of the current year. Cost-saving initiatives executed throughout the year provided a partial offset.Net loss was $(64.5) million, or $(6.62) per share, compared to $(17.5) million, or $(1.81) per share, in the prior year. Net loss from continuing operations was $(4.52) per share, compared to $(1.71) in the prior year. Net loss from discontinued operations was $(2.10) per share, compared to $(0.10) per share in the prior year. The increase in net loss was primarily due to the lower revenue, changes in non-cash foreign exchange, the aforementioned impairment, and the loss from the sale of Messaging and NetworkX.Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP metric reconciled below) increased 13% to $31.4 million (19.1% of total revenue) from $27.7 million (15.9% of total revenue) in the prior year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily attributable to cost-saving initiatives executed throughout the year. Financial CommentaryCFO Lou Ferraro added: “The fourth quarter underscored the effectiveness of our strategic refocus, as evidenced by our adjusted EBITDA climbing to $10.0 million and improved margins. This performance highlights the strong profitability profile of our standalone Cloud business. Our streamlined operating model is expected to have recurring revenue account for approximately 90% of total revenue in 2024, leading to enhanced revenue and cash flow predictability. Coupled with the expected $28 million tax refund later this year, these factors are set to significantly boost our cash flow generation in 2024, building from the improvements we already made in 2023.” 2024 Financial OutlookSynchronoss anticipates the continuation of positive trends it experienced with its customers throughout 2023. Coupled with its recent addition of SoftBank, the expiry of certain payment obligations and removal of other general costs in Q1, and the superior revenue to cash conversion capabilities of Cloud as a standalone business, Synchronoss is expecting net cash flow to be at least $10 million for 2024. The Company expects Cloud subscriber growth to be in the high-single-digit to low-double-digit range throughout 2024. For the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, the Company expects GAAP revenue to range between $170.0 million and $175.0 million, consistent with the previously communicated range of 5-8% growth. The Company expects adjusted EBITDA to range between $42.0 million and $45.0 million in 2024, consistent with the previously communicated margin range. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of these measures is included below under the heading ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures."" With respect to forward looking statements related to adjusted EBITDA, the Company has relied upon the exception in item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K and has not provided a quantitative reconciliation of forecasted adjusted EBITDA to forecasted GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Synchronoss or to forecasted GAAP income (loss) from operations, before taxes, within this earnings release because the Company is unable, without making unreasonable efforts, to calculate certain reconciling items with confidence. These items include, but are not limited to, other income, other expense, (provision) benefit for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, gain (loss) on divestitures, net (loss) income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Synchronoss has provided in this release selected financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP although this non-GAAP financial information is derived from numbers that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. This information includes historical non-GAAP revenues, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, effective tax rate, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Synchronoss, diluted non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, free cash flow, invoiced cloud revenue and adjusted free cash flow (which excludes cash payments and receipts related to non-core business activities). The Company believes that the exclusion of non-routine cash-settled expenses, such as Litigation and Remediation costs (net) and Restructuring costs in the calculation of adjusted free cash flow which do not correlate to the operation of its business, provide for more useful period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s results. Synchronoss uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating Synchronoss’ ongoing operational performance. Synchronoss believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends, and in comparing its financial results with other companies in Synchronoss’ industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. As noted, the non-GAAP financial results discussed above add back fair value stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related costs, restructuring, transition and cease-use lease expense, litigation, remediation and refiling costs and depreciation and amortization, interest income, interest expense, loss (gain) on divestitures, other (income) expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, and net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests, and preferred dividends. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as detailed above. Investors are encouraged to also review the Balance Sheet, Statement of Operations, and Statement of Cash Flow. As previously mentioned, a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release.

The company's strategic initiatives focus on high-performance OLED displays through a cost-effective fabless approach. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement by Kopin Corporation regarding the progress in establishing a fabless OLED display production for defense applications marks a significant step in the company's strategic initiatives. This move indicates an expansion in their manufacturing capabilities and a diversification of their supply chain, which can potentially lead to increased resilience against market fluctuations and supply disruptions. The focus on the defense sector, which often requires high-performance and durable displays, suggests that Kopin is targeting a market with specific and stringent requirements, which could translate into higher margins and stable long-term contracts.The partnership with a NATO-member European country for OLED deposition also implies a strategic geopolitical move that could provide Kopin with a competitive advantage in terms of reliability and security considerations for defense procurement. This could be particularly appealing to government and defense contractors who prioritize supply chain security in their procurement decisions. The successful initial life testing of the OLED displays indicates a commitment to quality and performance, which is crucial for maintaining a strong reputation in the defense and security markets. Financial Analyst Investors should consider the implications of Kopin's transition to a fabless OLED production model. By outsourcing the silicon backplane fabrication and OLED deposition, Kopin can potentially reduce capital expenditures and fixed costs associated with maintaining manufacturing facilities. This strategic shift could improve Kopin's financial flexibility and allow for a more dynamic allocation of resources towards research and development, which is critical in the technology sector.Furthermore, the announcement of near-zero degradation in brightness performance suggests that Kopin's products may have a competitive edge in terms of durability, a key selling point in the defense and security markets. If these performance results translate into actual product superiority in the field, Kopin could see an increase in market share within this niche market. However, investors should be vigilant about the execution risks associated with establishing new supply chains and the time frame of becoming production-ready by 2024. Defense Industry Analyst Kopin's focus on high-performance OLED displays for defense applications aligns with the growing demand for advanced technologies in military equipment. The ability to produce displays with brightness levels exceeding 20,000 cd/m2 is indicative of the company's commitment to meeting the rigorous demands of modern warfare, where visibility and reliability can be mission-critical. Additionally, establishing production in a NATO-member country could be strategically beneficial, potentially opening doors to European defense contracts and complying with regional defense procurement policies.The successful initial life testing and performance validation of Kopin's proprietary backplane technology highlight the company's innovative capabilities. If these technologies prove to be reliable in the field, it could lead to increased demand for Kopin's products from defense contractors looking for cutting-edge display solutions. The long-term implications for Kopin could include stronger partnerships within the defense industry and an enhanced position as a key supplier of specialized high-performance displays. 03/12/2024 - 04:01 PM WESTBOROUGH, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kopin Corporation (NASDAQ: KOPN) a leading provider of application-specific optical solutions and high-performance micro-displays for defense, enterprise, consumer, and medical products, today announced it has achieved two important milestones toward establishing “fabless” organic light emitting diode (OLED) display production for defense applications. First, to meet the needs of its customers in the Defense and Security markets, Kopin is in the process of establishing an OLED deposition partner in a strong NATO-member European country through a transition effort that is scheduled to be production ready in 2024. Second, as part of this activity Kopin’s deposition partner has completed initial life testing on representative samples and has achieved near-zero degradation in brightness performance after operating displays at brightness levels exceeding 20,000 cd/m2 for several thousand hours. In addition, the initial displays using Kopin proprietary backplane have been fabricated and are entering into performance validation testing. Kopin has developed a series of high-performance OLED displays that incorporate advanced features that are only available in recently developed designs. As per Kopin’s strategic initiatives in this area, the displays are manufactured using a fabless approach in which Kopin relies on partner companies to perform silicon backplane fabrication and OLED deposition. We believe this strategy allows Kopin to remain agile, utilize unique performance capabilities and rapidly adapt to evolving technology developments in a highly cost-effective manner. ""We are extremely pleased with the progress we are making in establishing an additional production OLED supply chain to support Defense and Security applications for our products while also retaining our lower cost consumer supply chains,” stated Bill Maffucci, the Company’s Senior Vice President of Business Development and Strategy. “Our existing supply chain allows us to supply OLED displays and display subassemblies to support customer development and system qualifications while we are completing our additional production capability. The results to-date not only validate that we are on-track to complete this transition in 2024, but they also confirm the outstanding performance of the Kopin OLED displays as market leading.” About Kopin Kopin Corporation is a leading developer and provider of innovative display and optical technologies sold as critical components and subassemblies for defense, industrial and consumer products. Kopin's technology portfolio includes ultra-small Active-Matrix Liquid Crystal displays (AMLCD), Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCOS) displays and Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) displays, a variety of optics, and low-power ASICs.

Financial Analyst The reported record fiscal year revenues of $116.4 million represent a modest year-over-year growth of 3%, which may be perceived as stable, albeit slow, growth in a competitive tech sector. The cash flow from operations in Q4 2023 amounting to $4.8 million indicates a positive operational efficiency, contributing to the company's liquidity and potentially its ability to reinvest in strategic areas. However, the increase in GAAP operating expenses from $41.3 million in FY 2022 to $47.2 million in FY 2023 raises concerns about rising costs, which could pressure future margins if not offset by higher revenue growth.Furthermore, the net loss widening from ($0.4) million in FY 2022 to ($5.5) million in FY 2023 suggests that despite top-line growth, profitability is challenged. This could impact investor sentiment and stock performance in the short term. The non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA decline from $5.4 million in FY 2022 to $2.8 million in FY 2023 also reflects a tightening of operational performance. For long-term implications, the company's strategic investments, such as the expansion of RFID production in Thailand and partnerships for new solutions, must translate into significant revenue growth to reassure stakeholders of the company's growth trajectory and profitability potential. Market Research Analyst Identiv's expansion in the RFID space, with units shipped increasing to nearly 200 million, indicates a strong foothold in the Internet of Things (IoT) market. The strategic move to secure an additional facility in Thailand for future RFID production suggests a proactive approach to capacity expansion in anticipation of increased demand. This is particularly relevant as the IoT market continues to grow, with RFID technology being integral for supply chain management and asset tracking.The collaboration with companies like Energous, Wiliot and Nexite highlights Identiv's commitment to innovation and could position the company as a key player in the emerging real-time tracking and BLE-enabled RFID categories. The launch of new products, such as the ScrambleFactor reader and the partnership with Mazars USA LLP, indicates a diversification of offerings, which could open up new revenue streams. However, the ability of these initiatives to contribute materially to the bottom line remains to be seen and investors will likely monitor the adoption rate and financial impact of these new technologies closely. Technology Industry Analyst Identiv's IoT Excellence Center in Germany and the release of bitse.io 3.0, an advanced global IoT connecting cloud platform, underscore the company's investment in innovation and its aim to lead in the IoT space. These developments are crucial as they signal the company's commitment to staying ahead in a rapidly evolving technology landscape. The secure employee login application contract with a global electronics retailer also indicates Identiv's capability to attract large-scale enterprise clients.However, technological advancements and market expansion come with associated risks. The company must manage the complexity of scaling operations internationally, particularly in Thailand, while maintaining product quality and meeting regulatory requirements. Additionally, the GAAP net loss suggests that despite strategic advancements, the company needs to closely manage its cost structure to achieve profitability. Investors will likely scrutinize future financials to assess whether these technological and strategic investments yield a favorable return on investment. 03/12/2024 - 04:00 PM Record Fiscal Year Revenues of $116.4 million Delivered $4.8 million in Cash Flow from Operations in Fourth Quarter 2023 Secured Second Facility in Thailand for Future RFID Production FREMONT, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Identiv, Inc.

Purple reaffirms its patent and trademark rights for its Hyper-Elastic Polymer gel material. The agreement ensures Purple's continued relationship with Mattress Firm for at least twelve months. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The settlement between Purple Innovation and Tempur Sealy involving the post-acquisition framework for Mattress Firm is a strategic maneuver within the specialty mattress sector. This agreement is vital as it ensures Purple's products will continue to be available in the nation's largest mattress retailer for at least twelve months, providing stability and potential revenue growth. The retention of Purple's current relationship with Mattress Firm post-acquisition by Tempur Sealy could prevent a potential loss of market share and secure customer loyalty during a critical transitional period.Furthermore, the resolution of intellectual property disputes reinforces Purple's position as a leader in innovative mattress technology. Owning proprietary technology, such as the Hyper-Elastic Polymer® gel material, can create a competitive edge and act as a barrier to entry for competitors. The market's recognition of gel technology and its association with Purple could drive consumer interest and enhance brand value. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the affirmation of Purple's patent and trademark rights is a positive development. Intellectual property is a critical asset that can contribute significantly to a company's valuation. Control over patented technology not only secures Purple’s unique market offering but also mitigates the risk of revenue loss due to patent infringement by competitors. This settlement could potentially deter future litigation, saving Purple both time and resources.The extended partnership with Mattress Firm is likely to have a favorable impact on Purple's revenue stream in the short to medium term. Investors should monitor the FTC's decision closely, as approval of Tempur Sealy's acquisition of Mattress Firm without objection will confirm this arrangement. The market will also look for signs of how Purple plans to leverage this period to explore expansion opportunities, as indicated by CEO Rob DeMartini. Legal Expert The amicable resolution of intellectual property disputes between Purple Innovation and Tempur Sealy is a significant legal development. Settling such disputes can often lead to a more focused business strategy as it removes the uncertainties associated with ongoing litigation. For stakeholders, the legal clarity provided by this settlement could translate into a more stable investment environment.The confidentiality of the specific terms is standard in such agreements, yet it suggests that both parties found a mutually beneficial ground. The legal reinforcement of Purple’s intellectual property rights, particularly in a highly competitive industry like mattress manufacturing, is crucial for safeguarding its innovations and maintaining a strong legal stance against potential future infringement claims. 03/12/2024 - 04:03 PM Framework for Mattress Firm Partnership and Confirmation of Purple's Patents LEHI, Utah, March 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Purple Innovation, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRPL) (""Purple"" or the ""Company""), a comfort innovation company known for creating the ""World's First No Pressure® Mattress,"" today announced that it has entered into a settlement agreement with Tempur Sealy International, Inc. (""Tempur Sealy""). The parties have agreed to a post-acquisition framework for Purple's partnership with Mattress Firm Inc. (""Mattress Firm""), the nation's largest mattress specialty retailer, subject to FTC approval of TSI's acquisition of Mattress Firm, and amicably resolved their various intellectual property disputes. Purple is pleased to reaffirm its valid patent and trademark rights in and to its proprietary Hyper-Elastic Polymer® gel material, the key component in Purple's GelFlex® Grid. If the FTC does not object to Tempur Sealy's acquisition of Mattress Firm, Tempur Sealy agrees that Purple will retain its current relationship with Mattress Firm for a minimum of twelve months, versus the two-month commitment in place previously. According to Rob DeMartini, CEO of Purple Innovation: ""Mattress Firm is an important and respected partner. We believe our Purple brand and products bring a high number of unique consumers into Mattress Firm stores. We appreciate working on an even playing field today and want to continue to work collaboratively with Mattress Firm. This agreement will give us time to explore expansion opportunities.""

Potential expansion in non-subsidized MVNO business and Comprehensive Platform Services. Positive outlook despite uncertainties surrounding ACP program funding. Management's successful execution of growth strategy reflected in financial results. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported EBITDA of $22.3 million and net income of $20.6 million signify robust profitability for SurgePays, especially when contrasted with the previous year's net loss of $0.7 million. The earnings per share (EPS) increase to $1.39 is a strong indicator of shareholder value creation and the gross profit margin improvement to 26% suggests enhanced operational efficiency. However, the quarterly revenue decline of 11% warrants scrutiny, as it may indicate volatility or challenges in sustaining growth momentum.It's essential to assess the sustainability of these financial results, particularly the reliance on the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) for revenue generation. The potential discontinuation of ACP funding could necessitate a strategic pivot to non-subsidized business models. Investors should evaluate the company's contingency plans and the feasibility of its growth strategy without ACP contributions. Market Research Analyst SurgePays' focus on the underbanked and underserved markets through its suite of prepaid wireless and financial technology products positions it within a niche yet significant segment. The acquisition of Clearline Mobile and the integration with SurgePays software could enhance the company's competitive edge in the convenience store space.However, the market for services targeting the underbanked is highly competitive and sensitive to regulatory changes. The reliance on programs like the ACP highlights the need for diversification. The planned launch of Linkup Mobile and the expansion of Comprehensive Platform Services are strategic moves that could broaden the company's revenue base and reduce dependency on government-funded programs. Telecommunications Industry Expert The telecommunications sector is rapidly evolving and SurgePays' strategy to integrate technology like customer-facing touchscreen tablets in convenience stores is innovative. This approach could disrupt traditional retail experiences for prepaid wireless services. The expansion of the ACP subscriber base and the efficiency in customer acquisition are pivotal for the company's growth in the subsidized mobile broadband market.Yet, the anticipated depletion of ACP funds by April 2024 presents a significant risk. The company's adaptability to potentially shifting market conditions and its ability to transition smoothly to a non-subsidized Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) model will be critical for its long-term success. 03/12/2024 - 04:01 PM Company Delivers Record Financial Results with EBITDA of $22.3 Million2023 Revenue of $137.1 million2023 Net income of $20.6 million2023 $22.3 million EBITDA2023 EPS of $1.39Gross profit margin increased to 26% BARTLETT, Tenn., March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SurgePays, Inc. (Nasdaq: SURG) (“SurgePays” or the “Company”), a technology and telecom company focused on the underbanked and underserved, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Full Year 2023 and Fourth Quarter Highlights Revenue of $137.1 million for the full year 2023 and $32.3 million for the fourth quarter, changes of 13% and -11% over the prior year periods, respectively.Gross profit of $35.6 million for the full year 2023 and $7.4 million for the fourth quarter, increases of 165% and 11% over the prior year periods, respectively.Net income of $20.6 million for the full year 2023 and $3.0 million for the fourth quarter. Management Commentary Chairman and CEO Brian Cox commented on the year’s results, “2023 was an excellent year for SurgePays. Our management team has done an outstanding job executing our growth strategy and delivered record financial results. Compounding profits, execution, and momentum from 2023, in conjunction with our successful raise in January and subsequent warrants exercised, have put us in the best financial position ever, with over $40 million in cash. The cumulative impact of our team's efforts has resulted in expanded opportunities and produced a year of solid profitability. We envision utilizing convenience stores and bodegas to become one of the largest distributors of unbanked financial technology and prepaid wireless services to the underbanked in the country. We believe we now have the product suite and war chest to make this vision a reality. Additionally, in 2023, we acquired Clearline Mobile to integrate our SurgePays software with customer-facing touchscreen tablets next to convenience store registers. We feel this technology, combined with the planned nationwide launch of Linkup Mobile in the second quarter of 2024, our own prepaid wireless company, gives us a competitive advantage that separates us from the competition in terms of our suite of products and services, in-store marketing strategy, and support team. Our focus is now on building in-house and indirect sales channels and distribution. In 2023, we produced $20.6 million in net income, compared to a net loss of ($0.7) million in 2022, through increasing revenue and expanding high gross margins. The ACP stopped accepting new applications for enrollment in February and is expected to run out of funding in April 2024. The company hopes that this essential program, which assists more than 20 million households, will be funded by Congress; however, at this time, we cannot predict any outcome. If the ACP is funded, we plan to expand our ACP customer base and use this base to expand our other business segments. If the ACP is not funded, we will look to increase revenue growth in our planned non-subsidized MVNO business and Comprehensive Platform Services through organic sales, key hires, and, as opportunities arise, complimentary acquisitions that are synergistic and accretive to our business model.” Management Discussion & Analysis SurgePhone wireless companies provide mobile broadband (wireless internet service) to low-income consumers nationwide. SurgePays' technology-layered platform empowers convenience store clerks to provide a suite of prepaid wireless and financial technology products to underbanked customers. We are attempting to corner the underserved market directly to the consumers and in the stores where they shop. During the year ended December 31, 2023, overall revenue totaled $137.1 million, or 113%, compared to the previous year. The increase was primarily due to Mobile Virtual Network Operations (“MVNO”), consisting of SurgePhone and Torch Wireless revenues related to providing subsidized mobile broadband and wireless service to consumers eligible for the ACP. The increase in MVNO revenue was $30.2 million in 2023, largely due to a subscriber count of over 260,000 wireless ACP subscribers at year-end 2023 compared to 200,000 at year-end 2022. Operating income improved to $18.9 million in 2023 from $0.6 million in 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher gross profit in 2023 due to higher MVNO gross profit, offset slightly by higher general and administrative (“G&A”) costs. Net income for 2023 was $20.6 million compared to a net loss of ($0.7) million in 2022. Earnings per diluted share increased to $1.39 in 2023 compared to a ($0.05) loss per share in 2022. The increase in net income was primarily a result of the expansion of our ACP subscribers and customer acquisition efficiency. EBITDA increased to $22.3 million in 2023 from $2.3 million in 2022.

Positive Revenue growth, client renewals, and pipeline growth indicate accelerated momentum for Quest Resource Holding Corporation. The company completed integrations of all acquisitions and onboarded all clients onto its platform in 2023. Investments in technology for efficiency, expansion in vendor network, and improving client experience are key focus areas for Quest. Adjusted EBITDA and net income showed improvement despite a slight decrease in gross margin. Quest achieved significant milestones in 2023, including securing new clients, adding vendors and service lines, and receiving a U.S. patent for Quest Proganics®. The company is focusing on debt reduction and long-term growth, with plans to evaluate long-term debt alternatives. Negative None. Financial Analyst Quest Resource Holding Corporation's announcement of an 11.4% year-over-year revenue increase in Q4 2023 and a modest 1.5% revenue increase for the full year suggests a positive trajectory in business performance. The revenue growth, coupled with the successful integration of acquisitions and the onboarding of all clients onto Quest’s platform, indicates a strategic expansion and operational efficiency that may enhance the company's competitive edge. However, it's important to note that despite the revenue growth, the company reported a GAAP net loss per diluted share, which improved from the previous year but still indicates that profitability is a challenge. The adjusted EBITDA increase is a positive signal for operational profitability, but stakeholders should closely monitor the company’s ability to translate top-line growth into bottom-line results.The Board’s decision to explore long-term debt alternatives could be a strategic move to optimize the capital structure and reduce the cost of capital, potentially leading to an improved financial position over time. This could be favorable for shareholder value, but the terms of any new debt arrangement and its impact on the company's financial flexibility will be critical to assess. Market Research Analyst Quest's announcement of new client wins, including a significant contract with a Fortune 200 company and the launch of seven new service lines, reflects a proactive approach to market expansion and diversification. The addition of over 400 new vendors to their network demonstrates Quest’s commitment to scaling operations and enhancing service capabilities. This strategic move not only broadens the company's market reach but also potentially increases its resilience to sector-specific downturns. The U.S. patent for Quest Proganics® indicates innovation and intellectual property development, which can provide a competitive moat and drive long-term growth within the environmental waste and recycling services industry.However, the reported decline in adjusted net income per diluted share year-over-year warrants attention. Investors should consider the company's investment in technology and business development against the backdrop of this earnings metric to evaluate the effectiveness of these investments in driving sustainable earnings growth. Environmental Consultant Quest’s focus on environmental waste and recycling services positions the company within a sector that is increasingly relevant due to growing environmental concerns and regulatory pressures. The investment in Quest Proganics®, a food waste recycling service, aligns with global sustainability trends and can provide significant value to clients looking to improve their environmental footprint. The ability to offer a patented solution that promises up to 96% diversion of organic waste from landfills could be a key differentiator in winning new business and retaining clients, especially as corporations face stricter waste management regulations.It is also noteworthy that the company is pursuing technology and efficiency programs aimed at improving client experience and operational margins. These investments could lead to long-term cost savings and enhanced service quality, which are critical factors in maintaining a competitive position in the environmental services industry. 03/12/2024 - 04:00 PM New Business Wins, Client Renewals, Revenue Growth, and Pipeline Growth Reflect Accelerated Momentum Across Business Completed Integrations of All Previously Announced Acquisitions; All Clients Onboarded onto Quest’s Platform in 2023 Investments in Technology Enabling Efficiencies, Expansion in Vendor Network, Growth in Service Lines, and Improving Client Experience Board of Directors Retaining Financial Advisor to Evaluate Long-Term Debt Alternatives THE COLONY, Texas, March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Quest Resource Holding Corporation (NASDAQ: QRHC) (“Quest”), a national leader in environmental waste and recycling services, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. “I am proud of the considerable progress Quest has made over the prior year and believe we are in an exceptionally strong position to grow our business in 2024 and beyond,” said S.

Programs will enhance vendor onboarding and billing, client invoicing and processing, and client service.Received a U.S. patent for Quest Proganics®, a food waste recycling service that can help grocers deliver as much as 96% diversion of organic waste from the landfill.Continued investment in business development leading to a very strong start in 2024 with six new client wins, three of which are expected to produce 7-figures in annual revenue and one of which is expected to produce 8-figures with a Fortune 200 company in a new end market vertical. “We achieved solid progress in the fourth quarter, driven by positive momentum across our business that has continued into the early part of 2024,” added Mr. Hatch. “We expect significant additional efficiencies to come from investments in our technology platform, which are in addition to savings from the previously announced $1.7 million in annualized cost efficiencies from the integrations of acquisitions. Quest is poised for sustained organic growth as we pursue numerous opportunities to accelerate our momentum with new client wins and expand our relationships with current ones, and we look forward to capitalizing on the wide range of attractive opportunities in both our existing markets and beyond.” Focus on Balance Sheet and Debt Reduction The Board of Directors, along with management, has formed a committee that will evaluate alternative long-term debt structures to lower our long-term cost of capital and to support long-term growth. The committee is in the process of retaining an independent financial advisor to assist in the process. Additionally, the Board is adding current director Glenn Culpepper, former Chief Financial Officer of Republic Services, Inc., to the Audit Committee as Chairman. Daniel Friedberg, Quest’s Chairman of the Board, added, “These actions reflect the Quest Board’s ongoing commitment to positioning the Company for long-term success and driving value for all shareholders. To that end, we are evaluating how we can best manage our debt and continue to identify ways to drive operating efficiencies, increase profitability, generate cashflow, and maximize long-term shareholder value.” Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast Quest will conduct a conference call Tuesday, March 12, 2024, at 5:00 PM ET, to review the financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023.

Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this press release, non-GAAP financial measures, ""Adjusted EBITDA,"" and “Adjusted Net Income (Loss)” are presented. From time-to-time, Quest considers and uses these supplemental measures of operating performance in order to provide an improved understanding of underlying performance trends. Quest believes it is useful to review, as applicable, both (1) GAAP measures that include (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) interest expense, (iii) stock-based compensation expense, (iv) income tax expense, and (v) certain other adjustments, and (2) non-GAAP measures that exclude such items. Quest presents these non-GAAP measures because it considers them an important supplemental measure of Quest's performance. Quest’s definition of these adjusted financial measures may differ from similarly named measures used by others. Quest believes these measures facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating potential differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company's GAAP measures.

(NYSE: LAZ) announces the Total Consideration for its cash tender offer of 3.750% Senior Notes due 2025, urging holders to read the Offer to Purchase and related documents before the Tender Offer's expiration. The Total Consideration per $1,000 principal amount of Notes is $987.80, with accrued interest payable up to the Settlement Date. The Tender Offer is subject to certain conditions and can be extended, amended, or terminated by Lazard Group. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Lazard, Inc. regarding the cash tender offer for its 3.750% Senior Notes due 2025 is a strategic financial decision that impacts the company's capital structure and debt profile. The Total Consideration of $987.80 per $1,000 principal amount indicates a price below par, which could suggest that the market expects interest rates to rise or that there is a perceived risk associated with the company or its industry. The fixed spread of 0 basis points over the yield to maturity of the UST Reference Security implies that the offer is closely aligned with current government bond yields, which serve as a benchmark for risk-free rates.From a financial perspective, this tender offer could be a move by Lazard to reduce its interest expenses or to manage upcoming maturities in a potentially rising interest rate environment. The fact that the offer is made at a price below par could be advantageous for Lazard if the market conditions allow for reissuing debt at lower interest rates in the future. However, for investors, the decision to tender their notes will depend on their assessment of the current interest rate trajectory and alternative investment opportunities.It is crucial to consider the liquidity position and the potential impact on the company's credit rating. If Lazard is buying back debt to deleverage, this could be viewed positively by credit rating agencies, potentially leading to a credit rating upgrade. However, if the tender offer is funded by additional debt, particularly at higher interest rates, it could strain the company's interest coverage ratios and negatively affect its creditworthiness. Market Research Analyst Within the broader context of the financial market, Lazard's tender offer reflects a proactive approach to liability management. The fixed income market closely monitors such offers as they can influence the supply and demand dynamics for similar instruments. The tender offer's acceptance rate will provide insight into investor sentiment regarding Lazard's creditworthiness and the attractiveness of the offer relative to the secondary market pricing.The timing of the tender offer should also be examined in relation to market trends. If the tender offer coincides with a period of market volatility or tightening monetary policy, it could indicate that Lazard is seizing an opportunity to reduce debt costs before further rate hikes. Conversely, if the market is in a downturn, the offer may be an attempt to preemptively manage risks associated with potential credit downgrades or refinancing challenges.Furthermore, the tender offer may signal broader industry trends, such as a shift towards more conservative financial management practices or a reaction to regulatory changes affecting the cost of carrying debt. It's important to observe how Lazard's competitors respond to similar market conditions and whether this triggers a wave of similar financial maneuvers across the industry. Legal Expert In terms of legal implications, the tender offer must comply with securities regulations and contractual obligations. The offer is subject to specific terms and conditions and any amendments or waivers to these terms could have legal ramifications. The announcement outlines the right of Lazard Group to extend, amend, or terminate the offer, which must be communicated in accordance with the law and could affect investor decisions.Additionally, the offer is not valid in jurisdictions where it is prohibited and in some areas, it must be made by a licensed broker or dealer. This highlights the importance of adhering to varying regional securities laws, which can influence investor participation and the overall success of the tender offer. The role of the Dealer Managers and the Information Agent is crucial in ensuring that the offer complies with all applicable regulations and that investors receive accurate and timely information.It is also vital to consider the potential for legal disputes arising from the tender offer process, such as disagreements over the settlement of tendered notes or discrepancies in the payment of accrued interest. The legal framework surrounding the offer must provide clarity and fairness to all parties involved to minimize the risk of litigation. 03/12/2024 - 03:01 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Lazard, Inc. (NYSE: LAZ) announced today the Total Consideration as set forth in the table below in respect of the previously announced cash tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) of its subsidiary Lazard Group LLC (“Lazard Group”) for any and all of its outstanding 3.750% Senior Notes due February 13, 2025 (the “Notes”).

(BZH) priced a $250 million offering of 7.500% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2031 to finance the redemption of their 6.750% Senior Notes due 2025, with remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The issuance of $250 million in Senior Unsecured Notes at 7.500% by Beazer Homes USA, Inc. is a strategic financial move that reflects the company's capital management strategy. The pricing at par indicates a balanced market reception, aligning with the current yield expectations for a company with Beazer's credit profile. The decision to use the proceeds to redeem the existing 6.750% Senior Notes due 2025 suggests a proactive approach to debt management, potentially reducing interest expenses and extending the maturity profile of the company's debt.However, investors should consider the implications of the higher interest rate on these new notes compared to the ones being redeemed. The incremental interest cost may impact future earnings, although the extended maturity could provide greater financial flexibility. The creditworthiness of Beazer Homes, as reflected by the interest rate on the new issuance, will be an important factor for investors to monitor, as it could indicate the market's perception of the company's long-term financial stability. Market Research Analyst In the context of the housing market and broader economic conditions, the issuance of these notes by Beazer Homes may be interpreted as a response to anticipated changes in interest rates and housing demand. By locking in a fixed interest rate until 2031, Beazer Homes is hedging against potential rate hikes that could increase borrowing costs on variable-rate debt or new debt issuances in the future.This move may also signal confidence in the company's operational performance and its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its debt obligations despite potential economic headwinds. The housing market's health is a crucial driver for Beazer Homes' business and thus, this debt restructuring could be seen as a preemptive measure to ensure stability in a sector that is sensitive to economic cycles and interest rate changes. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding this private offering is significant, particularly the reliance on Rule 144A and Regulation S for the sale of the notes to qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. persons, respectively. These exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 allow Beazer Homes to access capital more quickly than through a public offering, albeit with a more limited pool of investors.It is crucial for investors to understand that these notes, being unregistered securities, carry certain restrictions on their transferability. The legal intricacies of such private placements are essential in assessing the liquidity risk associated with these notes. Prospective buyers must be aware of the limited secondary market for such securities, which could affect their ability to divest should the need arise. 03/12/2024 - 02:50 PM ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Beazer Homes USA, Inc.

The company's total market cap now exceeds $10.5 billion, compared to $650 million in 1994. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The transformation of Macerich's retail properties into multi-use Regional Town Centers is a strategic response to the evolving retail landscape, where consumer preferences are shifting towards experiential shopping and mixed-use developments. This diversification into non-retail uses, such as coworking spaces, residential units and fitness centers, helps to mitigate the risk associated with the fluctuating retail sector, particularly as e-commerce continues to grow.By expanding the utility of its properties, Macerich is not only aiming to increase foot traffic but also to create sustainable revenue streams. This is evident in their significant market cap growth from $650 million in 1994 to over $10.5 billion today, reflecting investor confidence in their long-term strategy. The addition of luxury brands and upscale dining options further positions Macerich properties as premium shopping destinations, which can command higher rental rates and attract a more affluent customer base. Real Estate Investment Trust Analyst Macerich's focus on densely populated and attractive U.S. markets is a calculated move to capitalize on the higher spending power in these areas. As a REIT, Macerich's ability to generate consistent and growing dividends is critical for investor returns. The shift towards creating mixed-use spaces aligns with a broader industry trend, where REITs are looking to create integrated environments that serve as community hubs, thereby driving value for shareholders.The emphasis on sustainability, as evidenced by Macerich's #1 GRESB ranking, is an important factor for socially responsible investors and can influence institutional investment decisions. Their dedication to environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) goals may also provide a competitive advantage in attracting tenants and customers who prioritize these values. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Analyst Macerich's commitment to advancing environmental goals, social good and sound corporate governance, as highlighted by their consistent GRESB ranking, is indicative of the company's understanding of the importance of ESG factors in today's investment landscape. Investors are increasingly considering ESG criteria when making investment decisions, as these factors can significantly impact a company's reputation, risk profile and long-term financial performance.By integrating ESG principles into their business model, Macerich is addressing the growing demand for responsible investment opportunities and is poised to benefit from the increasing capital flows into ESG-focused funds. This proactive approach to sustainability and social responsibility could enhance Macerich's appeal to a broader range of investors and stakeholders, potentially leading to a more resilient and valuable real estate portfolio. 03/12/2024 - 04:00 PM New Company President & CEO Jack Hsieh Joined by Senior Executives for Celebratory MilestoneSANTA MONICA, Calif., March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Macerich (NYSE: MAC), one of the nation’s leading owners, operators and developers of high-quality retail and mixed-use properties in top markets, today marked its 30th anniversary as a public company by ringing the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange.

Aware also highlighted operational achievements, partnerships, and product enhancements in the biometric identity market. CEO Robert Eckel expressed optimism for future growth based on the strong financial foundation and increasing opportunities. Positive None. Negative Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $4.2 million, impacted by a $2.7 million expense related to a write-down of an investment. Adjusted EBITDA loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.2 million, showing a decline compared to the same period in the previous year. Full year 2023 net loss totaled $7.3 million, reflecting a negative impact from a $2.7 million expense related to a write-down of an investment. Adjusted EBITDA loss for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $4.6 million, despite an improvement compared to the same period in the previous year. Financial Analyst Aware, Inc.'s financial report indicates a 14% growth in total revenue and a significant 23% increase in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), which are positive signals for investors. The growth in ARR is particularly noteworthy as it suggests a shift towards a more stable and predictable revenue stream. The company's strategic transformation from a 'book and ship' model to one focused on recurring revenue appears to be yielding results, as evidenced by the alignment of ARR with the total revenue reported at the beginning of the transformation in FY 2020.The increase in cash reserves by $1.9 million also provides the company with a cushion for strategic initiatives or to weather economic downturns. However, the net loss of $7.3 million for the year, including a significant write-off from the investment in Omlis Limited, raises concerns about the company's investment strategies and risk management practices. The share repurchase program, while modest, suggests confidence by management in the company's valuation.Looking forward, the company's financial foundation and increased visibility in its pipeline could be a harbinger for continued growth. However, investors should consider the potential risks associated with the company's investment decisions and the broader market implications of adopting biometric technology. Market Research Analyst The biometric technology sector is rapidly evolving and Aware, Inc.'s focus on expanding its biometric identity platform could position it well within this growth market. The company's rank as a top performer in NIST Face Analysis Technology Evaluation and its recognition as a 'catalyst' in the biometric identity market report underscore its competitive positioning. These accolades, along with partnerships aimed at expanding market footprint, are likely to enhance the company's reputation and could lead to increased adoption of its solutions.Furthermore, the company's efforts to optimize demographic parity in biometrics could address growing concerns around bias and fairness in AI technologies, potentially opening up opportunities in sectors that are sensitive to these issues. The launch of AwareID® on AWS Marketplace could also significantly broaden the company's reach, tapping into AWS's extensive customer base.Investors should monitor the adoption rate of Aware's biometric solutions and the performance of new partnerships, as these could be critical drivers of future revenue growth. Awareness of global data privacy regulations and the public perception of biometric technology will also be essential in assessing the company's long-term growth trajectory. Technology Industry Analyst The biometric platform space is becoming increasingly important as businesses seek secure and efficient identity verification solutions. Aware, Inc.'s introduction of new functionalities for AwareID® and the development of a developer hub are strategic moves to accelerate the adoption of biometric technology. By simplifying integration processes, Aware is likely enhancing its appeal to technology providers and developers, which could lead to increased market penetration.The company's partnerships with entities like Serban Group, PeopleCert, Anyline, Uqoud and SoftwareONE not only diversify its revenue streams but also allow it to tap into new markets and sectors. The focus on product-market fit and targeted use cases suggests a strategic approach to product development and sales, which is key in a technology market where needs can be highly specific and varied.Investors should consider the pace of technological advancements in biometrics and the potential for new entrants to disrupt the market. Aware's ability to maintain its position as a leader in preventing bias in biometric algorithms will be crucial as the industry faces increased scrutiny over ethical concerns. 03/12/2024 - 04:02 PM Full Year Total Revenue Grew 14% to $18.2 Million, Marking Highest Level Since 2016 Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) increased 23% to Record $12 Million, Exceeding Total Revenue Reported at Beginning of Transformation in FY 2020 BURLINGTON, Mass., March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aware, Inc.

Management Commentary“Our strong performance in Q4 marked the culmination of a breakthrough year. Despite having to write-off our Investment in Omlis Limited, we are excited that we surpassed our financial guidance for ARR in 2023, demonstrating the impact of our business model transformation and positioning us for even greater success in the upcoming years,” said CEO and President Robert Eckel. “We’re entering the new year with $12 million of annual recurring revenue, which is approximately the same amount of total revenue the company generated when I began this transformational journey at the end of 2019. This shift from a short-term, book and ship company to a recurring revenue machine is now paying off—and positioned to continue to pay off. ""Our focus and growth in 2024 will continue to be centered on expanding through both our partnerships and customer relationships and advancing Aware’s product-market fit. With our increasing base of $12 million of ARR, and $31 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, we have an exceptionally strong financial foundation to execute our growth strategy and capitalize on an increasing pipeline of opportunities. Aware is in the best position since beginning our transformation in 2020. The improved visibility of our pipeline has led to its expansion and better rationalization, enhancing our decision-making and resource allocation capabilities. Supported by a focused go-to-market strategy, an enabled partner ecosystem, and product enhancements for targeted use cases of Aware’s Biometric Identity Platform, we are confident that we can deliver increasingly profitable growth in the years ahead.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial ResultsRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $4.4 million, compared to $6.4 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $4.1 million in the same year-ago period. The sequential decrease in revenue was primarily due to lower software licenses revenue while the year-over-year improvement was largely due to higher software maintenance revenue. Recurring revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 totaled $3.7 million, an increase of 40% compared to $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 totaled $4.2 million, or $(0.20) per diluted share, which compares to net income of $1.1 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023 and net loss of $1.8 million, or $(0.08) per diluted share, in the same year-ago period. Net loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was impacted by a $2.7 million expense related to a write-down of our note receivable from our 2022 investment in Omlis Limited. Adjusted EBITDA loss (a non-GAAP metric reconciled below) for the fourth quarter of 2023 totaled $1.2 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $0.4 million in the third quarter of 2023 and adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.5 million in the same year-ago period. The sequential decline in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to lower revenue while the year-over-year improvement in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenue. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $30.9 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $29.0 million as of December 31, 2022. Full Year 2023 Financial ResultsRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $18.2 million, compared to $16.0 million in the same year-ago period. The increase in revenue was primarily due to higher software licenses revenue. Recurring revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $11.0 million, an increase of approximately 13% compared to $9.7 million in the same year-ago period. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023, totaled $7.3 million, or $(0.35) per diluted share, which was impacted by a $2.7 million one-time, expense related to a write-down of our note receivable from our 2022 investment with Omlis Limited, which was partially offset by a $0.8 million one-time gain related to our fair value adjustment to the contingent acquisition payment from our 2021 acquisition of FortressID. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022, totaled $1.7 million, or $(0.08) per diluted share, which was favorably impacted by a $5.7 million one-time gain related to the sale of the company’s building located in Bedford, MA in July 2022. Adjusted EBITDA loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $4.6 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA loss of $5.2 million in the same year-ago period.

We discuss adjusted EBITDA in our quarterly earnings releases and certain other communications, as we believe adjusted EBITDA is an important measure. We use adjusted EBITDA in internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our Board of Directors, and evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations. We believe that the adjusted EBITDA financial measure assists in providing an enhanced understanding of our underlying operational measures to manage the business, to evaluate performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace, and to establish operational goals. We believe that the adjusted EBITDA adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in our financial and operational decision-making. We define recurring revenue as the portion of Aware revenue that is based on a term arrangement and is likely to continue in the future, such as annual maintenance or subscription contracts. We use recurring revenue as a metric to communicate the portion of our revenue that has greater stability and predictability. We believe that recurring revenue assists in providing an enhanced understanding of effectiveness of our efforts to transition to a subscription-based business model. We define ARR as the amount of annualized recurring revenue that is likely to continue in the future, such as annual maintenance and subscription contracts. We use ARR as a metric to assess the trajectory of our recurring revenue and we believe that ARR assists in providing an enhanced understanding of effectiveness of our efforts to transition to a subscription-based business model. Adjusted EBITDA and recurring revenue are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. We expect to continue to incur expenses similar to the financial adjustments described above in arriving at adjusted EBITDA and investors should not infer from our presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. The following table includes the reconciliations of our U.S. GAAP net loss, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to our adjusted EBITDA for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and our U.S. GAAP revenue, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to our recurring revenue for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

The deal will offer over 500 live events annually to Fubo subscribers in a seven-state region, solidifying Fubo's position as a leading sports-first live TV streaming platform. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The agreement between FuboTV and Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN) represents a strategic expansion in FuboTV's sports content offerings, particularly in terms of regional sports coverage. The deal enables FuboTV to stream over 500 live events annually, including every available game for the Baltimore Orioles and Washington Nationals, which could potentially increase subscriber engagement and retention rates, especially among baseball fans within the seven-state region.From a market research perspective, the inclusion of MASN's content on FuboTV's platform could strengthen Fubo's competitive positioning within the sports streaming niche. FuboTV's sports-focused strategy, which includes 55,000 live sporting events and the addition of 4K streaming, aligns with the growing consumer demand for high-definition, accessible sports content. This move could also diversify FuboTV's revenue streams, as it may attract a broader demographic, including NCAA sports fans, further enhancing its appeal to advertisers seeking targeted audience segments. Financial Analyst Financially, the partnership with MASN is likely to have a tangible impact on FuboTV's top-line growth. The increase in exclusive content offerings is a key driver for subscriber growth, which is a critical metric for investors evaluating streaming platforms. The direct access to regional games and events could lead to higher subscription numbers and more stable Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), as sports fans are known for their loyalty and willingness to pay for quality content.It is important to note that content acquisition costs associated with such deals can be substantial and may affect FuboTV's short-term profitability. Investors should monitor the company's quarterly financial reports following the implementation of this agreement to assess the impact on operating expenses and net income. However, if managed effectively, the long-term benefits of expanded content offerings could outweigh the initial costs, potentially leading to improved financial health and stock market performance for FuboTV. Sports Media Consultant From a sports media perspective, the addition of MASN's coverage to FuboTV's service is a significant development in the sports broadcasting industry. FuboTV's emphasis on becoming the 'home for local sports' taps into a dedicated fanbase that values regional sports networks (RSNs) and team-specific coverage. The ability to stream in 4K also enhances the viewer experience, setting a new standard for sports broadcasting quality in the streaming era.Moreover, as cord-cutting trends continue, FuboTV's positioning as a sports-first platform with comprehensive MLB coverage could capture a significant share of the market transitioning away from traditional cable subscriptions. This partnership also reflects the evolving dynamics between RSNs and streaming services, indicating a shift towards more flexible and accessible viewing options for sports content, which could have broader implications for the distribution strategies of sports networks and the media rights landscape. 03/12/2024 - 04:00 PM Fubo to Stream Baltimore Orioles and Washington Nationals Ahead of 2024 Major League Baseball Season NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- FuboTV Inc.

Blockchain Technology Expert The recent achievements of Humanity International Investments in partnership with BIO-key International, Inc. indicate a transformative step in the realm of digital identity and blockchain technology. The integration of biometric palm scan authentication with Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) for identity verification is a pioneering effort that leverages blockchain's inherent attributes of immutability and security to provide a digital identity solution.By achieving a large number of palm scans and NFT claims, the initiative is proving its scalability and user adoption. The impact on the digital economy could be substantial, as the technology provides a secure method for individuals, especially in underrepresented regions, to participate in the digital economy. The long-term implications include potentially increased financial inclusion and the creation of a decentralized identity verification standard that could disrupt traditional identity management systems. Economic Development Expert The Humanity Protocol initiative, with its Community Staking program, represents an innovative approach to economic empowerment and financial inclusion. By enabling individuals to have a verified digital identity and participate in an ecosystem that rewards their contributions, the program is poised to offer a new model for economic returns distribution.Such a program could catalyze economic growth in regions like Africa and Asia by unlocking access to digital services for those at the 'bottom of the pyramid.' The initiative's focus on inclusivity could help bridge the gap between the unbanked and the digital financial world, potentially leading to increased economic activity and prosperity in participating communities. Cybersecurity Analyst The collaboration between HII and BIO-key introduces a significant security enhancement in the digital identity space through the use of biometric palm scan technology. This advancement is critical in an era where identity theft and digital fraud are rampant. The application of such biometric data as a means of authentication for NFTs could set a new benchmark in cybersecurity measures for digital transactions.While the approach is innovative, it also raises questions about data privacy and the security of biometric data storage. The long-term success of such initiatives will heavily depend on the robustness of the cybersecurity framework employed to protect users' sensitive data against potential breaches. 03/12/2024 - 02:17 PM DUBAI, United Arab Emirates and HOLMDEL, N.J., March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Humanity International Investments (HII) and BIO-key® International, Inc.

The voting results show strong support for the merger, with Aeterna shareholders approving the transaction by high percentages. The merger is expected to create a sustainable business for delivering value to the biopharma sector and shareholders. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The approval of the all-stock merger between Aeterna Zentaris Inc. and Ceapro Inc. represents a significant consolidation within the biopharmaceutical industry. The strong approval rates, with at least 78.91% of Aeterna's shareholders and 67.23% of Ceapro's shareholders voting in favor, indicate a positive reception from the investor community. This merger is poised to create a larger entity with potentially increased market presence and resource allocation efficiency. The combined company's expected listing on both the Nasdaq and the TSX will likely provide greater liquidity and access to capital markets, which is beneficial for growth and expansion strategies.The critical aspect to observe post-merger will be the integration process, which often presents challenges such as cultural clashes and operational redundancies. Investors should monitor the combined company's ability to achieve the projected synergies that justify the merger rationale. Moreover, the newly formed company's strategic direction and how it plans to leverage its expanded pipeline and resources to deliver value will be crucial for long-term success. Market Research Analyst In the context of the biopharmaceutical sector, mergers and acquisitions are strategic moves to enhance R&D capabilities, expand product portfolios and enter new markets. The merger between Aeterna and Ceapro is likely to alter competitive dynamics, potentially increasing the combined entity's bargaining power with suppliers and distributors. From a market perspective, the merger could signal a trend towards consolidation in the biopharma sector, which is often driven by the need to diversify therapeutic areas and reduce the risk associated with drug development.Stakeholders should consider the potential for the combined entity to accelerate product development timelines and increase the scale of production, which can lead to cost savings. However, the challenge remains in ensuring that the merger does not stifle innovation or reduce competition, which could have adverse effects on the industry. Evaluating the merger's impact on the competitive landscape will be essential to understand its long-term implications for the market. Legal Expert The merger's dependency on customary closing conditions, including Alberta court approval and stock exchange approvals, highlights the regulatory complexities inherent in such transactions. Legal due diligence is paramount to ensure compliance with securities laws and to navigate the intricacies of cross-border regulatory frameworks, given the companies' listings on multiple stock exchanges. Of particular interest will be the handling of any potential antitrust concerns that may arise, as regulatory bodies often scrutinize mergers for their impact on competition within the sector.It is also noteworthy that the combined company will undergo a rebranding, with a new name to be considered and approved by shareholders. This aspect of the merger encompasses legal considerations regarding trademarks, intellectual property and corporate identity. The success of the rebranding will depend on the legal team's ability to effectively manage these aspects while maintaining continuity and market confidence. 03/12/2024 - 02:10 PM TORONTO and EDMONTON, March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aeterna Zentaris Inc.

CoreCivic plans to use the proceeds to repurchase the 2026 Notes and potentially redeem the remaining outstanding notes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst CoreCivic's recent completion of a $500 million senior notes offering at an 8.250% interest rate, due in 2029, indicates an aggressive capital raising strategy. The high-interest rate reflects the current economic environment and the company's creditworthiness. By guaranteeing these notes with existing obligations, CoreCivic leverages its entire corporate structure, potentially increasing risk for investors but also demonstrating confidence in its financial stability. The successful tender offer for the 2026 Notes, with over 83% of the outstanding principal amount tendered, shows a strong market appetite for CoreCivic's debt, which could be a positive signal for the company's credit profile.However, the decision to finance the repurchase of the tendered 2026 Notes using a combination of new debt and revolving credit facilities could lead to an increase in the company's leverage ratio. This could be a point of concern for debt holders and equity investors alike, as higher leverage can constrain a company's financial flexibility. It's also important to note that the new notes come with a higher interest rate than the 2026 Notes, which could lead to increased interest expenses and affect CoreCivic's future profitability. Investors will need to monitor CoreCivic's future earnings reports to assess the impact of these new debt obligations on its financial performance. Market Research Analyst The private prison industry, in which CoreCivic is a major player, has been subject to significant political and social scrutiny, affecting the industry's market dynamics and investor sentiment. The successful issuance of new senior notes could be an indicator of investor confidence in CoreCivic's business model and long-term contracts, despite the broader industry's challenges. The tender offer's high participation rate might also suggest that debt holders are optimistic about CoreCivic's ability to navigate regulatory and operational headwinds.However, the industry faces ongoing regulatory risk, which could impact CoreCivic's operations and, by extension, its ability to service its debt. Investors and analysts must therefore weigh these industry-specific risks against the potential returns from the company's high-yield debt offerings. The use of proceeds to manage existing debt rather than fund growth initiatives may also signal a more defensive posture by the company in the current market environment. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the structuring of CoreCivic's debt offering and tender offer adheres to SEC regulations, as evidenced by the use of a shelf registration statement and the detailed prospectus supplements filed with the SEC. The guarantees by CoreCivic’s subsidiaries provide an additional layer of security for the new note holders, which is a common practice in corporate finance to attract investors by mitigating risk.However, it's critical for investors to understand the terms outlined in the indenture governing the notes, especially the covenants and conditions that could affect CoreCivic's operational flexibility. The legal implications of these covenants, along with the company's adherence to them, could have significant repercussions on CoreCivic's financial health and its ability to meet its obligations, thus impacting investor confidence and the company's stock performance. 03/12/2024 - 01:21 PM BRENTWOOD, Tenn., March 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoreCivic, Inc.

Management focuses on increasing production from the Seven Rivers zone and optimizing recovery from the Grayburg and San Andres formations. The company's strategic approach aims to enhance shareholder value through increased revenue and earnings. Potential for significant revenue growth through increased drilling and recovery operations in key oil zones. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The announcement by HNRA about the potential to access an additional 34 million barrels of oil in the Grayburg and San Andres zones represents a significant development for the company and its stakeholders. The Grayburg and San Andres formations, located within the larger Permian Basin, are known for their rich hydrocarbon deposits. The ability to enhance production by adding perforations to existing wells is a cost-effective method compared to drilling new wells, which can be capital intensive. This strategy leverages existing infrastructure and minimizes additional environmental impact.The potential increase in reserves by over 200% from the previously reported 15.4 million barrels to a combined 49.4 million barrels could substantially extend the company's production life and revenue stream. The slow decline rate mentioned suggests an efficient reservoir management that may lead to sustained cash flows over an extended period. This could be particularly attractive to investors seeking long-term value in the energy sector.However, it is crucial to consider the volatility of oil prices and regulatory changes which can significantly impact the profitability of such projects. Furthermore, the execution risk associated with optimizing waterflood operations and the technical feasibility of infill drilling at the proposed well spacing must be monitored closely. Financial Analyst The disclosure of an additional 34 million barrels of oil reserves is a material event for HNRA, with direct implications for the company's financial health and stock valuation. The increase in reserves should be reflected in the company's balance sheet as an asset, potentially leading to an improved borrowing capacity and investment appeal. The projected longevity of the revenue stream, extending over two decades, provides a clearer picture of future earnings, which could lead to a re-rating of the company's stock by analysts.Investors will be interested in the net present value (NPV) of the additional reserves, which takes into account the time value of money and the projected cash flows from oil production. This analysis will provide a better understanding of the intrinsic value added to the company by the newly discovered reserves. Additionally, the company's ability to increase daily production and achieve record levels of revenue and earnings, as mentioned by the Vice President of Operations, could lead to upward revisions in earnings forecasts and potentially higher dividend payouts in the future.It is important to note that such projections are contingent upon successful extraction and market conditions. The cost of additional perforations, waterflood optimization and any other necessary capital expenditures to realize these reserves must be weighed against the anticipated revenue. Petroleum Engineer From a technical standpoint, the utilization of existing wells to access untapped reserves in the Grayburg and San Andres zones is a strategic move. The technique of adding perforations to existing wellbores is a tried-and-true method of enhancing oil recovery. This approach can increase the exposed surface area of the reservoir rock, allowing for more oil to flow into the wellbore. The mention of net pay mapping, which is the measurement of the thickness of the reservoir rock that contains hydrocarbons, indicates a thorough evaluation of the reservoir's potential.Waterflooding, an enhanced oil recovery technique mentioned by the company, involves injecting water into the reservoir to increase pressure and displace oil towards the production wells. Optimizing this process can lead to improved recovery factors and increased production rates. The company's reference to uniform injection and infill drilling suggests a comprehensive strategy to maximize oil recovery, which could indeed transform the field's output and profitability.The technical feasibility and economic viability of these operations are critical. Factors such as the reservoir's response to increased perforation and waterflooding, the potential for infill drilling to access bypassed oil and the integrity of the existing wells and facilities will all play a role in the success of the project. Investors should be aware of the technical challenges and risks associated with such operations, despite the promising outlook presented. 03/12/2024 - 01:45 PM HOUSTON, TX / ACCESSWIRE / March 12, 2024 / HNR Acquisition Corp (NYSE American:HNRA) (the ""Company"" or ""HNRA"") is an independent oil and gas company focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and production of oil and gas properties in the Permian Basin. Today, the Company announces that the potential untapped oil in the prolific Grayburg and San Andres oil zones may be accessed in the near term.After a series of management meetings with its independent petroleum consultants to review well log data and historical completion data, in addition to the previously announced proven reserves, there may be 34 million barrels of oil to be accessed in the prolific Grayburg and San Andres zones by simply adding perforations to existing wells in the Grayburg and San Andres formations in the Company's leasehold. Management has a dual path analysis underway where our VP of Operations is focused on maximizing short-term and long-term production in the Seven Rivers zone, and the Company's consulting geologist is assessing the best approach to recover oil from the Grayburg and San Andres zones.The Grayburg-Jackson field is currently producing crude oil and natural gas from the waterflood operations primarily from the Seven Rivers zone. Cobb and Associates (""Cobb""), third-party engineers, have updated our reserve report for the end of 2023 which has proven reserves of approximately 15.4 million barrels of oil and 3.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Our Grayburg-Jackson field is located on 13,700 leasehold acres in Eddy County, New Mexico with oil and gas rights to the Seven Rivers, Queen, Grayburg and San Andres intervals. The mapped original-oil-in-place (""OOIP"") is approximately 876 million barrels of oil in the Grayburg and San Andres intervals and 80 million barrels from the Seven Rivers interval for a total OOIP of approximately 956,000,000 barrels of oil.The proven oil reserves of over 15 million barrels, combined with the potential 34 million additional barrels from the Grayburg and San Andres zones, will produce oil and a revenue stream for more than two decades at a slow decline rate.""After reviewing all the current and historical data, the consultants estimate there are an additional 34 million barrels of oil left to recover under the leasehold from the Grayburg-San Andres formations,"" said Dante Caravaggio, President and CEO of HNRA. ""Net Pay mapping results in estimates of original-oil-in-place on the property from the Grayburg-San Andres to be approximately 956 million barrels.""""We believe that based on historical perforations, only 44 percent of the Grayburg-San Andres had been tapped,"" said Jesse Allen, Vice President of Operations, HNRA. ""With continued waterflood optimization, adequate uniform injection and infill drilling of 10-acre well spacing in the Seven Rivers, and now with increased drilling in the Grayburg-San Andres sands, HNRA could see a significant increase in daily production that will lead to record levels of revenue and earnings.""""When we acquired the Grayburg-Jackson field through the purchase of LH Operating, LLC, our team felt there was upside potential to increase the value of the property by increasing well spacing and by modernizing and enhancing maintenance of the field,"" said Joseph V. Salvucci, Sr., Chairman of the Board, HNRA. ""After completing the analysis, we are exploring the recovery of so much additional potential oil to be achieved through our existing operations.
