Motley Fool,Missed Out on Nvidia? Buy These Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/missed-nvidia-buy-artificial-intelligence-192600925.html,Companies profiting from AI hold considerable potential for outsize gains.,"Without a doubt, many artificial intelligence (AI) investors are kicking themselves for missing out on Nvidia's big gains. With the stock up 280% in the last year and over 1,800% in five years, it is one of the major beneficiaries in the AI space.Nonetheless, Nvidia is not the only AI stock in the chip industry, and AI is so much more than semiconductors. With the breadth of AI investing options, the industry should continue to bring opportunity. Three Fool.com contributors have ideas on where AI investors can look next: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).Amazon has many ways to win when it comes to AIJake Lerch (Amazon): There are hotter AI stocks out there, but Amazon remains one worth watching, and buying. Here's why:First, the company is the largest cloud services provider. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is estimated to have about 31% of the worldwide cloud services market. That's important because new generative AI tools and applications often utilize cloud services like AWS. As the AI revolution rolls on, Amazon is poised to profit thanks to its lead in the cloud infrastructure market.Second, Amazon's massive e-commerce business dovetails nicely with many different AI applications. For example, the company has already introduced Rufus, a new AI-powered shopping assistant designed to help people by answering questions, making pricing comparisons, and generating product recommendations. In addition, Amazon is using AI in many other areas of its operations, such as:Streamlining prescription drug delivery time and cost through Amazon Pharmacy.Lowering the company's environmental impact through AI-generated recommendations to reduce packaging use.Improving shopping recommendations via Amazon Fashion.Updating Alexa-enabled devices to enhance conversation and dialogue between users and Alexa.On top of all of that, Amazon remains one of the world's best-run companies. Shares are up 73% over the last 12 months, while revenue growth has bounced back to a solid 13%.Story continuesIn short, Amazon remains a smart choice for AI-focused investors.The Trade Desk benefits from AI and digital advertising tailwindsJustin Pope (The Trade Desk): Artificial intelligence is a hot topic today, but it began disrupting the advertising business several years back when The Trade Desk was in its infancy. Brands and other companies can buy advertising on The Trade Desk's platform, which uses AI and user data to match ads to potential customers. This is far more effective than traditional advertising, which would broadcast to broad audiences on television, radio, or in print.The Trade Desk has thrived, growing profitably since its 2016 initial public offering. The reason? The Trade Desk sits in an ideal spot in the industry. Advertising dollars are shifting to digital mediums and while competitors like Meta Platforms and Alphabet operate with limited transparency, The Trade Desk offers more information to its clients, and that is winning over customers.TTD Revenue (TTM) ChartTotal worldwide ad spending in 2023 was an estimated $830 billion, which means that The Trade Desk's $9.6 billion in gross ad spending translates to just over 1% of market share. That leaves a tremendous growth runway for this company operating outside the closed ecosystems of big technology companies.The Trade Desk's long-term growth opportunities and profitable business model make the stock a no-brainer AI investment you can hold for the long term.Tesla likely has some AI-driven surprises under the hoodWill Healy (Tesla): Investors may tend to look at Tesla as an automaker, but it's actually a diverse business also developing battery technology, solar energy solutions, and AI breakthroughs.Instead of relying on chip companies like Nvidia for its technology, Tesla has developed its own semiconductor and robotics solutions. Among these are the Dojo chip, designed to power neural networks, and the FSD (full self-driving) chip, which would power fully autonomous vehicles.CEO Elon Musk wants to launch a robotaxi business based on Tesla technology. With robotaxis, analysts at Cathie Wood's Ark Invest believe Tesla's revenue could reach a minimum of $600 billion by 2027, over seven times the 2023 level of $82 billion.Wood believes that growth would take Tesla's stock price to $2,000 per share, a more than tenfold gain from today's levels.While that may seem outrageous, and Musk has a track record of being overly ambitious in his promises, Wood predicted a split-adjusted price target of $267 per Tesla share in 2018. Within less than three years, Wood's prediction came to pass, so she could be right again.Tesla's stock price has pulled back as Tesla has cut prices on electric vehicles (EVs) to boost sales and stay competitive with emerging rivals. That pessimism has taken its P/E ratio down to 45, a low valuation rarely seen in the stock's history.Although profits are expected to fall 1% this year, analysts predict a 36% increase in 2025. These earnings forecasts give some validation to Wood's thesis. Some of that optimism may be related to the release of the lower-cost, compact Model 2 EV expected for 2025, and investors are also likely to jump in as the company improves its AI and self-driving capabilities.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"This 1 Chart Shows Why Nvidia Is the Top ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock to Hold Forever",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-chart-shows-why-nvidia-182700118.html,"Nvidia smashes past estimates again, and predicts even more to come in the current quarter.","Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) did it again. For the third straight quarterly period, the company blew past management's own revenue guidance by more than $2 billion. The technology company is the clear leader in advancing the many uses of artificial intelligence (AI).For Nvidia's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter ended Jan. 28, the company reported sales of $22.1 billion. That's an increase of 265% versus the year ago period, and well above the prior guidance of $20 billion.Nvidia and the AI boomThis one chart pretty much tells the whole story:Data Source: StatistaLast year marked an explosion in sales for the data center segment that includes advanced AI chips. Three of Nvidia's four business segments increased revenue year over year in its fourth quarter, with automotive being the only laggard. But the data center segment is the focus right now. Data center revenue was more than 400% higher than the prior year period.The company believes that escalation will continue as management believes total sales will be about $24 billion in the current quarter. These are also high margin products. In its full fiscal year 2024, gross profit margin expanded to almost 73% compared to just 57% in fiscal 2023. That's expected to continue to rise to more than 76% in the current fiscal 2025 first quarter.Of course investors have noticed these astounding numbers and Nvidia stock has rocketed higher along with its sales and earnings.While there will likely be ups and downs in the stock, it still doesn't look overly expensive. That's because of the still-accelerating growth. While a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 32 is pricey by traditional standards, that metric could decrease quickly as earnings expand.And the company still has potential for other areas to balloon. The previously mentioned automotive segment could grow quickly if self-driving vehicles become more mainstream. That's just one more reason to ensure Nvidia has a place in the growth stock portion of any portfolio.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,1 Growth Stock Down 65% to Buy Right Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-growth-stock-down-65-181000053.html,This cybersecurity stock is flying under the radar despite strong financial results.,"Overlooked growth stocks could be the biggest gainers during the current bull market. Many high-profile companies have enjoyed surging valuations as they recovered from the 2022 market correction. Some promising businesses have lagged their peers, and one cybersecurity stock in particular has attractive upside potential.An under-the-radar cybersecurity stockSentinelOne (NYSE: S) provides endpoint protection software and services to business customers. Its products are used to monitor and eliminate malicious software threats to devices and servers that are connected to an organization's network. The number of cyberattacks is increasing over time, and endpoints are one of the most common entry points to enterprise networks.It's easy to see why there's serious demand for endpoint security services and that demand is great news for SentinelOne, but taking advantage of that demand is another story. This portion of the cybersecurity industry is highly competitive, with large and capable providers including CrowdStrike, Microsoft, Palo Alto Networks, and Fortinet. The crowded space creates a lot of mouths to feed, even if there's a large and rapidly expanding pie to divide among the crowd.SentinelOne is trying to differentiate itself by leaning fully into artificial intelligence (AI). Its platform boasts automated monitoring and remediation capabilities. That should improve the efficacy of its threat detection, and it also reduces the burden on human employees to manage those processes. It's a shrewd move to stand out in the crowd, though it would be naive to doubt competitors' AI capabilities -- building automation into the platform will hardly be a unique value proposition. Still, SentinelOne finds itself getting high marks from Gartner and its customers. The company's clearly built a high-quality product.SentinelOne is also aiming to create a competitive advantage by forming distribution partnerships with managed security service providers (MSSPs). MSSPs allow companies to outsource cybersecurity functions, which tends to be valuable for smaller-scale businesses or companies in relatively low-tech industries that might lack the expertise to handle security in-house.Story continuesThere are pros and cons associated with a partnership distribution model rather than a direct sales model, but maintaining an MSSP network helps SentinelOne maintain a foothold instead of getting steamrolled by larger competitors with greater resources. Analysts speculate that SentinelOne's economic moat is weaker than the likes of CrowdStrike's or Palo Alto Networks', so it's important to pursue alternative strategies in order to stay afloat.Strong financial results that you can't ignoreThe financial results indicate that these strategic moves have been working. SentinelOne reported 42% year-over-year revenue growth in its most recent quarter, supported by 115% net dollar retention. That net dollar retention figure means that customers that were active one year ago are producing 15% more revenue now than one year ago. This indicates that a very low percentage of customers are discontinuing service, and that they are actively expanding their relationship with SentinelOne. That's evidence of high satisfaction, a strong product, and effective customer service and sales functions. Given the quality of competition, the combination of retention and new customer bookings is encouraging. The company reported a 24% year-over-year jump in the number of total customers at the end of its most recent quarter.SentinelOne is achieving this revenue growth without proportionate expense growth, which is another important consideration. Its most recent quarterly net loss was $70 million, compared to nearly $100 million last year. The company's cash burn rate is actually much lower than its accounting losses, thanks to roughly $300 million of annual noncash expenses.SentinelOne's free cash outflows for the most recent quarter were $26 million, down from $65 million the prior year. Clearly the burn is declining, and the company is approaching breakeven. Being able to support operations from internal net cash inflows would remove significant risk for shareholders, and that status is within grasp. SentinelOne has over $1 billion of short-term liquid assets, so the burn rate isn't a cause for concern as the company moves toward positive cash flows.Discount valuationSentinelOne stock is down more than 65% from its all-time high from late 2021. Cybersecurity stocks and growth stocks in general suffered a big sell-off throughout 2022. Low interest rates and fiscal stimulus related to the COVID-19 pandemic led to surging valuations for growth stocks. That trend quickly reversed when the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates, which fueled concerns about economic contraction and sent stocks tumbling.Most of the cybersecurity industry has recovered since then as investors anticipate a boost ahead of the Fed cutting rates again. SentinelOne has lagged most of its peers in this recovery, resulting in a discount valuation. Its price-to-sales ratio is under 15, making it significantly cheaper than CrowdStrike and Palo Alto.Investors can't ignore the competitive risks or the disadvantages of SentinelOne's smaller scale. However, SentinelOne's recent bookings and customer retention results suggest that it's holding its own in a growing industry. While the risk profile is relatively higher for this stock relative to peers, its valuation creates more opportunity for buyers. This stock should have more upside potential in the current bull market.Should you invest $1,000 in SentinelOne right now?Before you buy stock in SentinelOne, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SentinelOne wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,1 Hot Stock for 2024 With a Potential Nvidia AI Partnership,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-hot-stock-2024-potential-174700913.html,Cadence Design Systems has an exciting new AI product that can help fuel future development of more advanced computing systems.,"Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ: CDNS) -- a leader in semiconductor and computing system design software -- has been booming. Shares are up nearly 60% in the last 12 months, including a more than 12% increase so far in 2024. Its latest foray is with some help from artificial intelligence (AI).In early February, Cadence announced a new supercomputer system called Millennium M1 that it says is powered by graphics processing units (GPUs) ""from leading providers"" -- which could certainly mean Nvidia, the de facto leader in GPU systems and a longtime Cadence collaborator.Cadence's announcement is part of a broader trend in chip design, and AI (really, just think ""accelerated computing"" when you see those two letters) is driving the growth. Can Cadence continue its hot streak?Cadence and its brand of CFDThe Millennium M1 AI supercomputer is really a server, a large computing unit that can be installed either on a company's property (in an office, a private data center, etc.) or deployed in the cloud and accessed via an internet connection. Specifically, Cadence designed this computing platform for accelerating computational fluid dynamics, or CFD.It's a type of analytics and simulation software used in the design of all sorts of things -- including auto engines and how cars will behave driving down the freeway, jet engines and how a plane will fly, and industrial and manufacturing processes using liquids and other materials. Really, anything that ""flows"" can be analyzed and simulated using CFD.Cadence's Millennium Platform, powered by the Millennium M1, is the first CFD and multi-physics simulation product that uses a purpose-built supercomputer for performing such complex computations. Think of it as a turbocharged ""digital twin"" platform, enabling engineering teams to visualize how a product or project will behave in the wild, before ever manufacturing or building it.Story continuesNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been talking about the massive potential for digital twins for some time, especially when the metaverse was all the rage a couple of years ago. But CFD and multi-physics simulation actually has some of the most promising potential in the business world.Cadence has been gearing up for this, even hinting at a big Nvidia product release event a year ago that it was working on big things in CFD.For reference, these big moves in CFD -- really a type of convergence between the digital and physical worlds -- are why Cadence peer Synopsys is acquiring simulation software provider Ansys, and why hardware testing company Keysight Technologies made a simulation-software acquisition of its own last year.Does Cadence have a special advantage?So does Millennium give Cadence a leg up on the competition? It certainly could.Cadence and Synopsys are the two dominant players in semiconductor design software (called EDA, or electronic design automation). Lots of new devices with chips embedded in them coming to market refill the sails of these two industry giants.However, Synopsys' move on Ansys will mean significant debt will need to be paid off if the deal is finalized (perhaps in 2025). Meanwhile, Cadence is developing its own services that converge chip design with more mechanical processes in-house. Put another way, its clean balance sheet and best-in-class profit margins will remain intact, while Synopsys will have to digest its acquisition (again, if it happens).CDNS Revenue (TTM) ChartCDNS Total Long Term Debt (Quarterly) ChartAfter a stellar 2023 that featured soaring profitability, though, Cadence stock is expensive at nearly 50 times expected earnings for 2024. With a valuation like that, even a significant 20%-plus pullback in the share price won't make Cadence cheap.But innovations like its new AI supercomputer, powered by GPUs and other high-end hardware and software algorithms, make Cadence a premium stock for good reason. Be patient with this investment in 2024, and consider a dollar-cost average plan if long-term ownership of Cadence Design Systems fits your portfolio needs.Should you invest $1,000 in Cadence Design Systems right now?Before you buy stock in Cadence Design Systems, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Cadence Design Systems wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,3 Dividend-Paying Defense Stocks Worth a Look,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-dividend-paying-defense-stocks-174500224.html,Reliability is a good thing.,"In today's scorching hot stock market, investors may gloss over the favorable qualities of the defense industry.Defense companies aren't known for their growth. But they benefit from having a reliable buyer in the U.S. government, which provides predictable cash flows that support organic growth, dividend payments, and often, stock repurchases.Here's why RTX (NYSE: RTX), Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), and Honeywell International (NASDAQ: HON) stand out as three defense stocks worth a look.Image source: Getty Images.RTX's mix of revenue streams will attract investorsLee Samaha (RTX): The aerospace and defense industry had a difficult 2023. Defense businesses came under sustained margin pressure as ongoing supply chain issues negatively impacted operations. Meanwhile, the discovery of potential contamination in powder coating used to manufacture turbine discs in RTX's engines used in commercial aerospace (not least the Airbus A320 neo family) will ultimately result in multibillion-dollar hits to earnings and free cash flow (FCF) over the next few years as engines need to be removed and inspected.Still, there's a value case to be made for the stock. Its aerospace end market remains in growth mode. While the powder coating issue is a disappointment, there's only one other competitor engine on the Airbus A320 neo family, namely the LEAP engine of CFM International (a General Electric joint venture), but that already has a multiyear backlog in place.Meanwhile, at some point, the supply chain issues dogging the defense industry will abate, creating the possibility for margin headwinds to turn into tailwinds. In addition, there's no shortage of geopolitical tension right now and pressure on NATO countries to ramp up spending or at least replenish equipment used in conflict theaters.As such, RTX operates in two end markets that are likely to be in growth mode over the near to medium term. RTX and its dividend face challenges, but are worth a look given the two sectors in which the company operates.Story continuesLockheed Martin is a stalwart defense contractor that generates robust free cash flowScott Levine (Lockheed Martin): Lockheed Martin stock currently provides income investors with a 3% forward-yielding dividend. And with its strong backlog and prodigious free-cash-flow generation, Lockheed Martin seems well suited to continue rewarding shareholders with its generous dividend in the coming years.Although lower sales and higher costs related to the company's F-35 fighter jet adversely affected the top and bottom lines last quarter, Lockheed Martin recently celebrated an otherwise strong end to 2023. Driven by the strong performance of its space segment, Lockheed Martin recognized a 2.4% year-over-year increase in sales and a 21% year-over-year increase in net earnings. The growth carried over to the cash-flow statement as well, where Lockheed Martin reported 2023 free cash flow of $6.23 billion, representing a 1.6% increase over 2022.However, for those looking to fortify their portfolios with a leading defense stock like Lockheed Martin, confidence that the future remains bright is equally important. Thanks to the company's robust backlog, this certainly seems to be the case. Lockheed Martin reported a company record $160.6 billion in backlog at the end of 2023 -- an auspicious sign that the company will be able to grow the dividend.Over the past 10 years, Lockheed Martin has averaged a payout ratio of 54%. And that's not the only indication that the company can sustain the dividend.LMT Dividend Per Share (Annual) ChartThe company consistently generates strong free cash flow that it can use to fund the dividend.With geopolitical tensions showing little sign of abating anytime soon, Lockheed Martin's business will remain in high demand, making it a worthy addition to income investors' portfolios.Honeywell has finally found its footingDaniel Foelber (Honeywell): Honeywell isn't a pure-play defense stock in the same way that RTX and Lockheed Martin are. But that could work in investors' favor.Honeywell's largest segment is aerospace, but it makes up just 37.2% of sales. Honeywell's other business units are building technologies, performance materials and technologies, and safety and productivity solutions.Honeywell's greatest strength is that it operates a high-margin, diversified business where no single segment makes up too great of a share of sales or profit.Earlier this month, Honeywell reported overall solid 2023 results. But the real standout was its 2024 guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $9.80 to $10.10, which would be up 7% to 10%. Honeywell's 2024 guidance also calls for organic growth of 4% to 6%, which is in line with the company's long-term target for 4% to 7% organic growth.Free cash flow is forecast to be $5.6 billion to $6 billion in 2024 -- more than enough to fund the company's dividend with cash. For context, Honeywell spent $8.3 billion in 2023 on dividends, stock buybacks, capital expenditures, and mergers and acquisitions. But the dividend payment only cost Honeywell $2.72 billion -- meaning it is expecting this year's FCF to be more than double the dividend obligation.It's been a bumpy ride for Honeywell investors since the onset of the pandemic. As you can see in the following chart, Honeywell has slowly been building up its profits to return to the pre-pandemic high. Sales are down by quite a bit, but Honeywell has made up for that by improving its margins, which has made the business leaner and more efficient overall.HON Revenue (TTM) ChartDespite the good results, Honeywell remains in ""prove it"" mode. It needs to sustain at least mid-single-digit organic growth and high-single-digit or low-double-digit growth once factoring in strategic mergers and acquisitions and buybacks. It also needs to show meaningful results from monetizing the Industrial Internet of Things and artificial intelligence -- themes that Honeywell has been touting for years with unclear material impacts on the bottom line.The good news is the stock isn't expensive, sporting just a 23.5 price-to-earnings ratio. It also has a dividend yield of 2.2% as of this writing.Honeywell is a good choice for investors who want exposure to the defense industry but with the benefit of a diversified industrial conglomerate.Should you invest $1,000 in RTX right now?Before you buy stock in RTX, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and RTX wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,What's the Best Way to Invest in Stocks Without Any Experience? Start With This Index Fund.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-best-way-invest-stocks-171400522.html,"If you don't have any history of investing in stocks, start with a simple, diversified ETF. This is the one you'll want to go with.","Too many new investors go from zero to 100 miles an hour. I know -- that's exactly what I did when I started out. There are all sorts of reasons why this happens, many of which go back to how human emotions work. Take it from someone who made a lot of early investment mistakes: A much better path is to start investing slowly with the goal of learning as you go.With the advent of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which didn't exist when I started out, you can learn and invest with relative ease. There are many options you could start with, but a really good one is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO).Why start slow?It's important to understand that everyone (everyone!) makes investing mistakes. Nobody's perfect, and nobody has all the answers. The problem is that very few investors, particularly successful ones, spend much time talking about their mistakes. It's far more enjoyable to discuss the winners.The issue here is that, when you start out, a single investment mistake can wipe you out. Emotionally, that might result in you never investing again, which would probably be bad for your long-term finances.NVDA ChartThe solution is to stop yourself from jumping in with both feet and risking everything on a single investment. For example, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is a hot stock today, with all sorts of positive things being said about it. But the stock is up over 250% in a year, which is an incredible gain in a very short period of time. A new investor might look at that and think that the stock can't lose, expecting it to keep going up and up. It's an artificial intelligence play, after all, and that's the big thing right now.Nvidia might keep rising, but anyone who's been around Wall Street long enough knows that trees don't grow to the sky. Eventually, mercurial investors will find another hot theme and drop Nvidia. It's a pattern that repeats with great consistency for reasons ranging from a slowdown in a company's growth trajectory to, frankly, just plain boredom among investors. As an example, shares of Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO), another tech name, still haven't recovered to the peak levels they reached before the dot.com crash at the turn of the century.Story continuesCSCO ChartThe best way to avoid getting caught up in Wall Street's hype machine is to start broadly and then slowly start to dip your toes into buying individual stocks. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF will let you do just that.What is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF?Exchange-traded funds are pooled investment vehicles in which many investors provide capital to a professional manager that invests for the group. One of the biggest benefits of this is that the pooled investment vehicle can usually buy a more diversified portfolio than any single member of the pool could on their own. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF invests in the stocks that make up the S&P 500 Index, as its name implies.The S&P 500 Index is one of the most commonly used market barometers. You will find the ""story"" behind the performance of your investment in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF very easy to track. That will help you learn as you invest. And, because it is a broad market proxy, you will have a diversified portfolio that will help to limit the damage that comes from owning poorly performing stocks (remember, even the best investors make mistakes).The S&P 500 Index is a curated list meant specifically to represent the U.S. economy. So there's a bit of human intervention in the mix, and the overall portfolio won't likely get too heavily focused in any one area. That said, the index is market cap weighted, so the largest companies get the largest allocation of cash. Usually the biggest companies are also among the best performing, so this subtle way of focusing a little more on a few stocks is generally a net benefit.The best part, however, is that the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is shockingly cheap to own, with an expense ratio of just 0.03%. So one single investment gets you exposure to around 500 stocks (and all of the benefits, like diversification, that go with that) and all you pay is 0.03%, which is a really, really low number on Wall Street. The only potential negative is that the dividend yield is a tiny 1.4% or so, but that's to be expected given the size of the portfolio.Start with the ETF and prepare for the next stepSo start yourself out by opening a brokerage account and buying the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF. Keep saving money and putting it into this diversified market proxy. And read all you can about investing and the market. When you have a little bit of money built up, take a few thousand dollars -- no more than 5% or 10% of your nest egg -- and buy a single stock. If you like the experience, keep learning and doing more investing. If you don't, you can just stick with the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF for the rest of your life.Should you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?Before you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Cathie Wood and Warren Buffett Each Own This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock. 1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks It Could Surge by 26%.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-warren-buffett-own-164100668.html,"Amazon provides investors with a deep level of diversification from e-commerce, cloud computing, advertising, and artificial intelligence.","Two of the most closely followed investors on Wall Street are Warren Buffett and Cathie Wood. But the two don't share much in common.Buffett has made billions sticking to a relatively simple investing strategy -- seeking companies that generate strong, consistent cash flow and build best-in-breed brands. Much of the portfolio of Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is concentrated in sectors like consumer goods, financial services, telecommunications, and energy. On the other hand, Wood's Ark Invest portfolio is comprised of growth stocks in emerging areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), genomics, and crypto.Despite very different approaches to investing, Wood and Buffett both own ""Magnificent Seven"" stock Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). While the company is best-known for its online store, Amazon is also home to a leading cloud computing operation, and is even beginning to make inroads in streaming, entertainment, and advertising.With the stock up over 70% in the last year, one analyst on Wall Street sees much more room for growth. Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI has a price target of $220 for Amazon stock, representing about 26% upside from Thursday's closing price.Let's dig into Amazon's business and get an understanding of how the company has been able to attract two of the most prominent investors on Wall Street, and why there could be a lot more room for it to run.How much Amazon stock do Wood and Buffett own?While Wood's and Buffett's portfolios both hold Amazon stock, it's important for investors to understand that it is a relatively small position for both investors.Buffett owns about $1.5 billion of Amazon stock, which represents only about 0.44% of Berkshire's total portfolio. Similarly, Wood's position in Amazon is in only one of her exchange-traded funds, and the company represents just 0.06% of the fund.I wouldn't get caught up in the details of Amazon's weighting relative to other holdings for either investor. Wood likely views Amazon as a hedge to some of her other technology investments in smaller businesses. Meanwhile, the Oracle of Omaha has long avoided the technology sector in general and so it's not entirely surprising to see only a small allocation in a business like Amazon.Story continuesImage source: Getty Images.AI could boost Amazon's entire businessOne thing that makes Amazon so unique is that the company operates across a wide spectrum of end markets. E-commerce and cloud computing are the company's primary growth drivers. However, its Amazon Prime subscription service provides customers with access to media such as movies and television shows, and its $47 billion advertising business is quickly becoming a major force in the company's ecosystem.Providing investors with a deep level of diversification is only part of the value proposition for Amazon. On a deeper level, advancements in AI have the ability to fuel growth across Amazon's entire business. The company's multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI competitor Anthropic back in September could be the key to unlocking new synergies in Amazon Web Services (AWS). Moreover, use cases surrounding generative AI are exploding, and have the potential to bring Amazon's e-commerce and advertising segments to a new level.Amazon stock has room to runMahaney's bullish stance on Amazon does not hinge just on the company's ability to generate strong revenue. Rather, the investments that Amazon is making across its platform should lead to significant margin expansion in the long run. As such, the company should be able to generate robust, sustained cash flow that it can use to reinvest in other growth areas.As AI becomes a pillar for the next phase of evolution for Amazon, I agree with Mahaney's take that a return to revenue and cash flow acceleration looks achievable.It seems that investors may be underappreciating Amazon's potential to emerge as a leader in AI. At a price-to-sales multiple of just 3.1, Amazon stock trades at the biggest discount based on this measure among the Magnificent Seven. Investors have an opportunity to scoop up shares at a steep discount relative to Amazon's megacap peers.AMZN PS Ratio ChartShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist and 1 to Avoid,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-warren-buffett-stocks-buy-161300853.html,"He's called the Oracle of Omaha for good reason, but Buffett might have just inherited more drama than he was probably expecting.","You could certainly do worse than ride Warren Buffett's stock-picking coattails. His Berkshire Hathaway portfolio boasts a market-beating long-term track record, after all. And he's managed to beat the market with a simple buy-and-hold approach rather than constantly swapping out existing holdings for hotter prospects.Just because a stock is currently in Berkshire's portfolio, however, doesn't mean it's a great pick for you to purchase at this time.With that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at two Warren Buffett stocks most investors can plow into right now, and one you might want to steer clear of -- at least for the time being.Bank of AmericaIf you're looking for excitement, pass on Berkshire Hathaway holding Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). It doesn't offer it.But if you're looking for reliable and consistent results, Bank of America is for you.The company doesn't need too much of an introduction. It's the nation's second-biggest banking name, with $2.5 trillion worth of assets on its books. Like most of its peers, it provides basic banking services like checking accounts and loans, as well as a variety of investment and wealth-management services. Also like most of the country's bigger banks, Bank of America works with corporations to help them raise capital. It's not a particularly complicated business, and it's not as if one of these entities enjoys a hyper-competitive edge.And yet, Bank of America is clearly something of a standout within the banking industry. It managed to add 130,000 new consumer checking accounts last quarter, and brought in 40,000 new brokerage and private-banking customers. Investment banking fee revenue improved 7% year over year despite the worldwide lull in capital markets activity. Its capital ratios and equity ratios are holding up pretty well, too, despite the wobbly economic environment.Perhaps the only worry in last quarter's numbers is the uptick in loan charge-offs, but even this growth was only slight. A mere 0.45% of the bank's total loan portfolio was written off last quarter, versus 0.35% a quarter earlier and 0.26% in the same quarter a year earlier. That's more than manageable.Story continuesThe point is, even if it is less than exciting, this is a solid company in a business that's never going to go away. The stock is currently sporting a dividend yield of 2.8%, paying shareholders for their patience.Bank of America is Berkshire's second-biggest holding, by the way. Its 1.03 million shares are worth a total of $35 billion.Occidental PetroleumJust when you think Buffett can't possibly want to own even more of a particular organization, he buys more. Berkshire Hathaway's purchase of 19.6 million shares of energy company Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) in the fourth quarter of last year brings Berkshire's tally up to 243.7 million shares. The whole stake is worth $14.5 billion, or roughly one-fourth of the oil and gas company's market cap.It was a somewhat curious pick when Berkshire first established the position back in 2019. While Occidental is a fine company as far as energy stocks go, it's not been a sector Buffett has seemingly been interested in for quite some time. That may have something to do with the fact that environmental concerns are slowly but surely working against traditional oil and gas companies. In this vein, the advent of renewable energy sources and the threat they pose to hydrocarbons may play a role in that relative disinterest as well.However, as time marches on, it's becoming increasingly clear that oil and natural gas are going to be needed for a long, long while. The International Energy Agency believes global consumption of oil, natural gas, and even coal will actually continue growing through 2030. Once reaching that peak six years down the road, demand will gradually fall all the way to 2050.Translation: There's still plenty of money to be made within this sector.There are also plenty of stocks to choose from as a means of capitalizing on this persistent demand. Of all these options, Occidental is arguably one of the best. Under the leadership of Vicki Hollub, the company seems to have a confident grip on which assets are worth investing in, and which are worth letting go.For instance, Occidental Petroleum is rumored to be working toward a sale of its natural gas pipeline operator Western Midstream Partners in order to pay down debt, but at the same time is acquiring CrownRock in an effort to expand its onshore operations in the Permian Basin. This kind of asset optimization ultimately sets the stage for wider profit margins.Capital One FinancialAt the other end of the spectrum, Buffett fans might want to hold off on any new positions in Capital One Financial (NYSE: COF) until the dust settles. The dust in question, of course, is the recent announcement that Capital One is making a $35 billion bid to acquire rival credit card company Discover Financial Services.On the surface it seems like a reasonably good fit. The two organizations' target markets and strategies are more similar than not. And there's little doubt that this team-up could prove a true competitive threat to credit card powerhouses Visa and Mastercard. Discover even manages its own payments network (albeit a smaller one than Visa or Mastercard) that could eventually handle Capital One cards as well.There's a reason, however, that Capital One Financial shares didn't budge following Monday's announcement of the bid. Two reasons, actually.One of these reasons is that while the strategic thinking behind the acquisition makes enough superficial sense, investors may not be entirely convinced the $35 billion price of the all-stock deal is worth it. Discover's 2023 net income of just under $3 billion on revenue of $16 billion is respectable to be sure. But Capital One is looking to pay a premium price for a company with a wobbly asset base and growing delinquencies and charge-offs.The other reason the market didn't respond all that bullishly to the news is that the deal may not close. The U.S. Justice Department must first approve the pairing, and it's been particularly wary of mergers within the banking sector lately. Green-lighting the acquisition won't necessarily push Capital One shares higher, yet forbidding the deal could potentially upend the stock.There's also the not-so-minor reality that integrating two companies, each with their own well-defined structures and custom-designed tech, often turns out to be more complicated than initially expected.The simple solution for interested investors? Look elsewhere -- at least for the time being. You don't need the drama that could soon unfurl here.Should you invest $1,000 in Capital One Financial right now?Before you buy stock in Capital One Financial, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Capital One Financial wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,2 Dividend-Paying Tech Stocks to Buy in February 2024,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-dividend-paying-tech-stocks-161100809.html,Find out how dividend-paying tech giants could be your ticket to steady returns in a volatile market.,"The stock market can be nerve-wracking at times, especially in the volatile tech sector. Wall Street may be in the midst of a fresh bull market, but there's still a lot of turbulence to deal with. But there's a handy shortcut available if you're looking for investments with the business-growth promise of exciting tech stocks and the long-term stability of a blue-chip business titan.The trick is to look for solid dividends. Even in Silicon Valley, a generous dividend suggests robust cash profits and a relatively calm stock chart. By virtue of pure mathematics, dividend yields fall when stock prices are skyrocketing, so a strong payout leads you away from overly expensive stocks. On the flip side of the same equation, you're not looking for extremely high yields which typically spring from deep share price dives.And on that note, I see a couple of top-quality tech stocks with dividends in the Goldilocks zone -- just right for starting a low-risk tech investment right now. Let me show you why International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) tick all the right boxes for dividend investors in February 2024.1. IBM: 3.6% dividend yieldBig Blue invariably comes to mind whenever I think about a solid commitment to dividend payouts. IBM's unbroken streak of annual dividend increases started with a 40% boost in January of 1996. The split-adjusted quarterly payouts have increased from $0.063 to $1.66 per share, which works out to a 28-year gain of 2,560%:IBM Dividend ChartThe dividend boosts have been modest since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, but those symbolic increases never stopped. Even better, the dividend checks were always directly funded by free cash flows, with the cash-based payout ratio topping out at 85% in the inflation crisis of 2022.Even, even better, Big Blue is finally reaping the rewards of a strategy shift that started more than a decade ago. The IBM you see today has reshaped its business model with a laser-like focus on high-growth markets such as data security, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI).Story continuesYeah, you heard me. IBM has not-so-quietly built a world-class business around its Watson AI platform. The company was a little late to the AI boom since it takes its enterprise-class clients a while to run new solutions through testing and management approvals, but the financial benefits have started to trickle in.So IBM gives you generous, cash-backed dividends alongside a highly promising future of high-margin AI services. Not too shabby, right? And the only clue needed to arrive at this incredible investment today was that juicy but still affordable 3.6% dividend yield.2. Intel: 1.2% dividend yieldLet's shift gears without leaving the neighborhood. Intel's semiconductor fortunes have been intertwined with IBM's software and systems since the beginning of time (in terms of the fast-moving tech sector, anyway).Intel's dividend chart is less pristine, but for good reason. You see, the tech titan is pulling every available lever to expand its chip-making capacity, building and boosting manufacturing facilities around the world. This effort involved a steep dividend cut in 2023, rising debt balances, and accepting a few quarters of negative cash flows.INTC Dividend ChartIn return, Intel now runs one of the world's largest semiconductor manufacturing services for other chip designers. That's a sharp strategy shift, taking advantage of the Biden administration's CHIPS Act and a long-running global shortage of chip-building capacity.Today, Intel's stock gives you a different kind of hardware giant whose negative cash flows should spring back from the red-ink bath over the next couple of years. Playing an infrastructure role in this AI-driven era of high demand for memory chips and number-crunching processors could be a genius move in the long run, to the point where it almost looks like Intel's management saw the AI frenzy coming from a mile away. The timing is just too perfect.Oh, and Intel's dividend yield peaked just below 6% before the payout cuts. That's uncomfortably high, especially when the company needs extra cash for business-building purposes. The current yield of 1.1% is on the low side of that just-right zone but still respectable enough. And again, this reasonable yield is a good starting point for a deeper stock analysis.Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and International Business Machines wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Stock Split Watch: Is Meta Platforms Next?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-split-watch-meta-platforms-153000494.html,"With its stock up 175% over the past year, Meta could potentially benefit from a stock split.","In recent years, stock splits have become increasingly frequent on Wall Street, with companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla joining the trend. While stock splits may not drastically alter a company's valuation, they can serve a purpose, including enticing more individual investors to buy shares at a lower price.One tech company that hasn't participated so far is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), known for Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. But with its shares trading near an all-time high, it could potentially benefit from a split. Let's explore further.What's a stock split?A stock split is when a company increases the number of its outstanding shares while maintaining its market capitalization. This means that each existing shareholder receives more shares, but the total value of their investment remains unchanged.To illustrate, let's say you're an investor holding 10 shares of a company valued at $100 each. If the company decides to execute a 2-for-1 stock split, your holdings would double to 20 shares, and the share price would halve to $50 each. It's important to underscore that a stock split doesn't alter the fundamental worth of your investment; instead, it adjusts the number of shares you possess. In this example, your investment was worth $1,000 before and after the stock split.Why would a company split its stock?When a company's stock, such as Meta Platforms, commands a high trading price, it may present a barrier to entry for certain investors. While fractional shares are readily accessible through many brokerage platforms, notable exceptions like Vanguard do not offer this option. In theory, a lower share price could enhance accessibility, potentially boosting demand for the company's shares and thereby increasing its market capitalization.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has previously argued that a lower stock price helps a company's ability to both attract and retain talent, whether through equity compensation packages or employee stock purchase plans.Story continuesA company's eligibility for inclusion in a price-weighted index -- such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is determined from an average of the share prices of all the companies -- can also be impeded by a higher stock price. As a result, stocks with higher prices, such as Meta, face a lower likelihood of being added, since their share prices could disproportionately skew the index.Meta has never split its stock beforeMeta Platforms has never split its stock since going public in early 2012 at $38 per share. For investors who have held on to their shares since then, the stock has delivered an impressive return of 1,133%, surpassing the benchmark S&P 500's total return of approximately 379%.Notably, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Meta, had a plan to split Facebook's stock in 2016. This involved creating a new class of shares without voting rights for the general public, which would have enabled Zuckerberg to maintain control of the company while selling his shares to finance his charitable initiatives.Zuckerberg withdrew that proposal in September 2017, noting that ""Facebook's business has performed well and the value of our stock has grown to the point that I can fully fund our philanthropy and retain voting control of Facebook for 20 years or more.""Is Meta Platforms a buy ahead of a potential stock split?Investing in a company solely because of the potential for a stock split is usually not recommended. The company's financial performance has a far more significant effect on its long-term stock performance. Therefore, it's more important to assess Meta's recent business performance and consider the guidance provided by its management when it comes to making an investing decision.In 2023, which Zuckerberg deemed the ""year of efficiency,"" Meta generated $134.9 billion in revenue and $39 billion in net income, marking a year-over-year increase of 16% and 69%, respectively.Looking ahead, management provided revenue guidance in the range of $34.5 billion to $37 billion for the first quarter of 2024, representing a year-over-year increase between 21% and 29%. While management didn't offer an earnings outlook, it did note that its total expenses for 2024 are expected to be between $94 billion and $99 billion, reflecting a potential increase of between 6.6% and 12.2% from $88.2 billion in 2023.Beyond its recent financial results and management's guidance, Meta's strong balance sheet with net cash (cash and cash equivalents minus total debt) of $47 billion allows the company to return capital to shareholders. In 2023, Meta spent $20 billion on share repurchases, lowering its outstanding shares by 2%. The company still had $31 billion remaining on its share repurchasing program as of Dec. 31, 2023. Additionally, the tech company announced its first-ever quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, equating to an annual yield of 0.4%.One concern for Meta is how much money it spends on its Reality Labs division, the company's virtual reality and augmented reality hardware and software unit. In 2023, Reality Labs was responsible for an astounding $16.1 billion loss from operations, which was 17.5% worse than in 2023. Moreover, Meta expects those losses to ""increase meaningfully"" in 2024.Investors will have to wait and see whether Meta's big bet on Reality Labs pays off. In the meantime, Meta is producing strong revenue and earnings growth while returning capital to shareholders. Given its position as a leader in social networking, growth investors would be wise to consider it for their portfolios -- stock split or not.Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.
