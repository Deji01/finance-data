Motley Fool,Why AT&T Stock Rallied Tuesday Morning,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-t-stock-rallied-tuesday-195826173.html,The telecom specialist got a little love from Wall Street.,"Shares of telecommunications specialist AT&T (NYSE: T) popped on Tuesday, climbing as much as 3.3%. As of 1:30 p.m. ET, the stock was still up 2.6%.The catalyst that sent the telecom stock higher was an upgrade and some positive commentary from a Wall Street analyst.Is AT&T stock going to $21?Wolfe Research analyst Peter Supino upgraded AT&T stock to outperform (buy) from peer perform (hold) while simultaneously boosting his price target to $21. For those playing along at home, that suggests potential upside of 25% compared to Monday's closing price.The analyst points out that AT&T has underperformed over the last several years -- which is undeniable. Over the past three years, AT&T stock is down 25%, even as the S&P 500 has gained 34% (as of the market close on Monday).Supino notes that rating the stock underweight (sell) has been a ""safe"" bet, but believes the pessimism is now overdone. ""Amidst apathy and negative muscle memory, we argue that it's time to take [AT&T] seriously as a long,"" he wrote. He went on to point out that ""amid bad headlines about convergence, interest rates, and lead, AT&T is growing its core, gaining efficiency, and paying down debt.""The evidence is beginning to mountAfter years of subpar performance, AT&T may finally have turned things around. In its most recent quarter, AT&T delivered, generating solid revenue growth, robust free cash flow, and notable subscriber gains. Perhaps most importantly, the company achieved its goal of $6 billion in run-rate cost savings and is making progress toward an incremental $2 billion cost savings by 2026.The stock is still trading near a 30-year low, selling for less than 9 times earnings. That, combined with its dividend yield of 6.6% and a reasonable payout ratio of 57%, suggests it may finally be time to buy AT&T.Should you invest $1,000 in AT&T right now?Before you buy stock in AT&T, consider this:Story continuesThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and AT&T wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,1 Wall Street Analyst Just Slashed This EV Stock's Price Target by 80%. Here's What That Means.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-wall-street-analyst-just-195400666.html,"Fisker stock is trading well below $1 per share, and investors are looking for information.","Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse for Fisker (NYSE: FSR) stock, you're suddenly staring at a company that's lost 70% of its market capitalization since the start of the year. One Wall Street analyst has now cut the electric vehicle (EV) stock's price target by a whopping 80%.Why is this analyst slamming Fisker stock?Soon after Fisker released its preliminary numbers for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 on Feb. 29, Citi analyst Itay Michaeli slashed Fisker stock's price from $4 a share to only $0.80.While Fisker expects to deliver 20,000 to 22,000 Ocean SUVs this year, versus only 4,929 units in 2023, backed by a growing dealership network, it is burning cash so rapidly that management has issued a ""going concern"" warning. Simply put, Fisker's existing resources aren't enough for it to run operations for the next 12 months, and the company will seek debt or share sale to raise money. Meanwhile, Fisker said it will delay the regulatory filing of its annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission.On a positive note, Fisker is negotiating with a ""large automaker"" for a ""potential transaction which could include an investment in Fisker, joint development of one or more electric vehicle platforms, and North America manufacturing."" Citi analyst Michaeli, however, believes such a partnership alone won't help when Fisker is facing serious concerns like demand, tightening liquidity, and lingering accounting issues.Michaeli is right that it's hard to form an investing thesis for Fisker stock right now despite a promising EV platform and acclaimed automotive designer and co-founder Henrik Fisker at its helm. Fisker's gross margin was negative 35% in Q4, which means it is losing a lot of money per vehicle it is producing, and it ended the quarter with less than $400 million in cash and equivalents.Should you invest $1,000 in Fisker right now?Before you buy stock in Fisker, consider this:Story continuesThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Fisker wasn’t one of them.

Don't Act Surprised.America Blew Almost $2 Trillion. Make It Stop.Equities lost traction after a rally that has spurred concern about sky-high valuations — especially in megacaps, leaving the group vulnerable to big moves in the face of bad news. Apple Inc.’s iPhone woes in China deepened, while Advanced Micro Devices Inc. hit a US roadblock in selling an artificial-intelligence chip to the Asian nation. And Tesla Inc. extended its rout as China shipments slumped.Bullish positioning in US technology stocks is at the highest in three years — raising the risk of a pullback, according to Citigroup Inc.’s Chris Montagu. Long positioning in Nasdaq 100 futures is “extremely extended,” he said.“Trees don’t grow to the sky,” said Kenny Polcari at SlateStone Wealth. “What is starting to concern some investors is whether or not some of these tech companies that have gotten stretched can in fact live up to the ‘lofty valuations’ that investors have placed on them.”Wall Street also weighed data showing the US service sector cooled — even as orders and business activity picked up. Caution prevailed, with Powell heading to Capitol Hill for his semiannual testimony before Congress, where the Federal Reserve chief is expected to reiterate the lack of urgency to cut rates.The S&P 500 fell below 5,100, while the Nasdaq 100 dropped about 2%. All megacaps fell, with Tesla extending a two-day slide to 11% and Apple dropping to the lowest since October. Treasury 10-year yields slid eight basis points to 4.13%. In the latest sign of market exuberance, Bitcoin hit a record — before erasing gains. Gold also touched an all-time high.Story continuesNever miss an episode. Follow the Big Take podcast on iHeart, Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you listen. Read the transcript.The “Magnificent Seven” — comprising Apple, Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Tesla — have powered the S&P 500 to all-time peaks this year, partly fueled by the AI frenzy.The rally has left strategists scrambling to lift their 2024 targets — while raising questions on whether tech is seeing a boom or a bubble.To JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Marko Kolanovic, the dramatic rally in US equities and Bitcoin signals accumulating froth — conditions that typically precede a bubble when asset prices rise at an unsustainable pace. Meanwhile, David Kostin at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is among those who argue big tech’s lofty valuations are supported by fundamentals.The so-called Magnificent Seven saw its average earnings per share rise 55% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Most of that group helped drive the Nasdaq 100 to its fourth consecutive monthly gain.“The AI craze is a modern gold rush, and the tech ‘picks and shovels companies’ are seeing earnings explode as companies buy chips and cloud space to fuel the boom,” said Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report. “But if AI doesn’t result in increased profitability for the rest of the S&P 500 over the coming years, then demand for AI chips will evaporate as will AI-related cloud demand.”With generative AI set to be the growth theme of the decade, UBS’s Chief Investment Office continues to believe that US tech stocks should make up a substantial portion of investors’ equity allocations. However, the firm says investors with excessive exposure should consider broadening tech exposure to capture the next growth opportunities.“While we see further room for the current tech rally to run, we think investors should review and optimize their exposure to technology to protect against potential declines and benefit from opportunities beyond big tech,” said Solita Marcelli at UBS Global Wealth Management.“Although we see pockets of speculation and the tech sector could be due for a breather, we don’t see a bubble,” said Keith Lerner at Truist Advisory Services. “Valuations are rich on most metrics, but with tech, comparative earnings momentum tends to be a more important near-term driver. And profit trends remain strong and are at new highs.”The three-year outperformance of the tech sector to the S&P 500 is just above 30%, Lerner said. This is roughly in line with the 30-year average and far from the peak of just above 250% seen in March 2000, he added.“Comparisons to the dot-com bubble should be expected given the concentration of gains in the tech sector and proliferation of excitement around a new technology,” said Ross Mayfield at Baird. “But from 1996 to 1999, the average three-year trailing return was 96%. We are not yet close to those levels. There’s room to run.”Valuations, earnings trends and market sentiment all refute speculation that an AI-driven tech bubble has reemerged in US large caps, according to Bloomberg Intelligence strategists led by Gina Martin Adams.“Our theme universe of AI stocks shows sales generally supporting price gains, with multiples in the middle of their five-year range,” they wrote. “Unless fundamental shortfalls emerge, high-market-cap concentration for mega-cap tech and strong returns for AI may not present material risk to the S&P 500.”The largest five equities in the S&P 500 trade at less than half the multiples of the “Four Horsemen” — Intel Corp., Cisco Systems Inc., Microsoft and Dell Technologies Inc. — in March 2000, which surpassed 80 times on a forward price-to-earnings basis, according to BI.Additionally, valuations appear to be relatively contained across accelerating technology themes — such as AI, future of finance, cloud and robotics — with most baskets trading at or beneath five-year average price-to-sales multiples, they said.“While we stand by our argument that US stocks are not in a bubble, the confluence of a prospective Fed easing cycle and an attention-grabbing new technology does raise the risk that one might form later this year and into 2025,” said Nicholas Colas at DataTrek Research. “The easiest way to sidestep this problem would be for the Fed to delay rate cuts as long as possible.”While stock prices are not part of the Fed’s official mandate, Colas wonders if Powell will try to dampen the market’s recent enthusiasm by delivering a more hawkish than expected message this week.Corporate Highlights:Target Corp.’s fourth-quarter profit beat estimates, as the retailer continued its improvements in inventory management and said its decline in traffic slowed.Walt Disney Co.

Motley Fool,Why Iron Mountain Stock Surged 16.5% in February,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-iron-mountain-stock-surged-190134501.html,The real estate investment trust expects more growth following a record year.,"Shares of Iron Mountain (NYSE: IRM) soared 16.5% in February, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Driving up the real estate investment trust (REIT) was its strong fourth-quarter results and bullish outlook for 2024. Project Matterhorn is paying dividendsIron Mountain reported quarterly and full-year records for revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) last month. Revenue grew 7% for the year to nearly $5.5 billion, while adjusted EBITDA also rose 7% to almost $2 billion. The REIT focused on secure storage also delivered a 5% increase in its adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share. The company's Project Matterhorn initiative, which it launched in late 2022, is delivering the expected growth acceleration. The company's investments in data centers are helping boost growth. It leased 124 megawatts of data center capacity last year, which will help set the stage for more growth in 2024. The REIT also released its 2024 guidance last month. ""We are well positioned to continue our growth trajectory in 2024, which is reflected in our financial guidance for double-digit revenue growth,"" said CEO William Meaney in the fourth-quarter report. Iron Mountain expects revenue to climb 11% to more than $6 billion while adjusted EBITDA will increase by 12% to around $2.2 billion. Meanwhile, its adjusted FFO will rise by about 8% per share. The company expects Project Matterhorn to continue propelling its growth. Iron Mountain will also get a boost from its recently closed acquisition of Regency Technologies, which will enhance its asset lifecycle management capabilities. Iron Mountain remains in an excellent position to continue growing briskly due to the robust demand for data center capacity. Cloud computing and other catalysts like AI are accelerating demand for data center capacity. That should enable Iron Mountain to continue growing its global data center platform at a healthy rate. Story continuesIs Iron Mountain a buy after last month's rally?Iron Mountain trades at less than 17 times its 2024 FFO estimate after last month's rally. While it's not as cheap as it was, it's still one of the least expensive ways to invest in the data center megatrend. The company's relatively low value has it offering an attractive dividend (currently yielding 3.2%) that should continue rising (it gave investors a 5% raise last year). The company also has a strong balance sheet, with its 5.1 times leverage ratio near its lowest level in a decade. That gives it the flexibility to continue investing in Matterhorn initiatives that accelerate its growth, which should create more value for investors over the long term. These factors make Iron Mountain an attractive long-term investment opportunity these days.

FreightWaves,Old Dominion Freight Line still waiting for market to turn,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/old-dominion-freight-line-still-190043414.html,Old Dominion Freight Line reported modestly better trends in February compared to January but noted the market remains soft. The post Old Dominion Freight Line still waiting for market to turn appeared first on FreightWaves.,"Old Dominion reported a 7% yield increase through the first two months of the first quarter. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Old Dominion Freight Line reported a modest improvement in metrics during February but said market conditions “continue to reflect softness in the domestic economy.”The less-than-truckload carrier saw revenue per day increase 1.2% year over year (y/y) during February, following a 2.7% decline in January. Tonnage was down 3% as a slight increase in shipments was offset by a 3.2% decline in weight per shipment. January saw a 2.3% decline in shipments while shipment weights were 3.2% lower.January was a tougher-than-normal month for carriers as severe winter storms forced terminal closures, resulting in some shipments getting pushed to February. Old Dominion (NASDAQ: ODFL) also had an easier y/y tonnage comp in February (down 12.4% a year ago) compared to January (down 7.8%).The carrier continues to see favorable yield results as it remains one of the most price-disciplined operators in the business. Revenue per hundredweight was 3.7% higher y/y for the first two months of the first quarter and 7.1% higher when excluding fuel surcharges.“The increase in our LTL revenue per hundredweight was supported by a favorable pricing environment and our ongoing ability to deliver superior service at a fair price,” said Marty Freeman, Old Dominion’s president and CEO, in a Tuesday news release.Table: Company reportsThe lower shipment weights have been a contributor to the improving yield metrics.On its fourth-quarter call at the end of January, Old Dominion said it had roughly 30% excess capacity to accommodate future volume growth. It hasn’t been adding terminals at a high clip like some of its competitors, which are seizing on an opportunity following the shutdown of Yellow Corp. (OTC: YELLQ).Saia Inc. (NASDAQ: SAIA) reported Monday a 19% y/y jump in shipments during February, which followed a 12% increase in January. The company acquired 28 terminals from the bankrupt estate and plans to spend more than $500 million on real estate in 2024. It expects to increase door count by 12% to 14% during the year.Story continuesOld Dominion plans to leverage the $2 billion it has invested in real estate over the past decade to achieve its growth goals. The company has a track record of winning market share when the freight cycle turns positive. On the January call, it said it had outperformed market growth rates by 600 to 1,000 basis points on average in prior cycles, noting a midteens advantage during the 2021 freight boom.“We believe our value proposition is unmatched in the marketplace, which provides us with a tremendous opportunity to win market share and produce strong, profitable growth once the macroeconomic environment begins to improve,” Freeman concluded.The carrier has easier comps on the horizon than most of its peers. During the 2023 second quarter, it recorded midteen tonnage declines each month versus the industry, which was down only slightly.Shares of ODFL were down 2.8% at 1:50 p.m. EST on Tuesday compared to the S&P 500, which was down 1.1%. Saia was up 3% at the time.More FreightWaves articles by Todd MaidenTransportation prices up in February but capacity grows fasterSaia sees 19% jump in February shipmentsForward Air’s Q4 call offers no financial targets after Omni mergerThe post Old Dominion Freight Line still waiting for market to turn appeared first on FreightWaves."

Motley Fool,Why PubMatic Stock Rose 38% Last Month,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-pubmatic-stock-rose-38-182100689.html,"The company is growing and profitable, and the stock is cheap.","Shares of advertising technology (adtech) company PubMatic (NASDAQ: PUBM) rose 37.9% during February, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The stock meandered along for most of the month before skyrocketing right at the end. The sharp rise in late February coincided with the company's latest financial report.The report in question was for PubMatic's fourth quarter of 2023. It came out on Feb. 26 and showed that the company generated quarterly revenue of nearly $85 million, up 14% year over year. For perspective, management had expected Q4 revenue of only $76 million to $80 million.Not only did it solidly outperform management's guidance, but PubMatic's 14% top-line growth was its best growth rate in over a year, as the chart below shows.PUBM Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) ChartMoreover, PubMatic's management expects to grow revenue by 10% in 2024, which is better than its 4% full-year growth in 2023. Therefore, the market is excited that business is picking back up.Why it mattersOf course, it's not so much that PubMatic's growth rate went up -- it's why. The adtech space has been in a slump for various reasons, and some companies are still struggling. But PubMatic is returning to growth faster than some of its peers due to its ability to gain new customers.PubMatic's growing customer base resulted in a higher number of ad impressions -- the number of times ads were displayed. In 2023, the company's ad impressions were up 32% from 2022.Additionally, PubMatic was able to reduce its expenses, meaning its growth was profitable as well. The company's cost to deliver 1,000 ad impressions went down by 8%. This improvement contributed to its full-year free cash flow of nearly $53 million, which was up 38% year over year.What now?PubMatic stock has nearly doubled from its 52-week low, but shares still look attractively priced today. The company is valued at about 20 times its forward free cash flow, which is reasonable.Story continuesIt's important to note that PubMatic's ad impressions are growing faster than its revenue, suggesting its ad prices are still facing headwinds. However, if the advertising space heats back up, this could provide an unexpected tailwind to the business.PubMatic's management is also taking advantage of what it believes to be a cheap stock price. It's authorized to buy back over $115 million of its stock, which is about 11% of its shares outstanding at today's price.In summary, PubMatic is growing despite industry headwinds, and its growth rate could pick up when the headwinds abate. The company is profitable and cheaply valued, which could make this stock a buy today, even after its big gains in February.Should you invest $1,000 in PubMatic right now?Before you buy stock in PubMatic, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and PubMatic wasn’t one of them.

The Telegraph,Currys investor hits out at ‘absurdity’ of London Stock Exchange as more companies prepare to quit,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/currys-investor-hits-absurdity-london-181418927.html,A major Currys investor has hit out at the “absurdity” of valuations on the London Stock Exchange as two more companies prepare to quit.,"currysA major Currys investor has hit out at the “absurdity” of valuations on the London Stock Exchange as two more companies prepare to quit.JO Hambro Capital, a top 10 Currys shareholder, criticised the dismal valuations the London stock market attaches to businesses, saying Currys should be worth far more than what investors have valued it at.The electronics retailer is subject to a possible bidding war between suitors Elliott Advisors and China’s JD.Com. Currys recently rejected a 67p per share bid from Elliott, which valued the business at about £756m.Hambro’s veteran fund managers, James Lowen and Clive Beagles, said an “acceptable offer” for the tech retailer would be closer to 100p per share, which would value the company at close to £1bn. The fund managers pointed out that Currys had sales of £9.5bn last year.Mr Lowen and Mr Beagles wrote in a note to their investors: “This clearly shows the absurdity of UK stock market valuations.”The criticism adds to fears that low valuations in London are leaving companies vulnerable to foreign takeovers and risk tipping the stock market into a spiral of decline as more businesses leave.The gloom over the London market intensified on Tuesday after one of its oldest constituents was also snapped up by an American buyer for £1bn. Spirent Communications, which has been listed since 1955, agreed to an all-cash takeover by US rival Viavi Group.The British tech company works with companies like Amazon and Meta, testing their equipment. Shares surged 58pc to 172 pence, just below the takeover price.It marks the fourth foreign bid for a London listed company in the last few weeks, following the Currys offers and bids for Wincanton and Direct Line.In a further blow to London, co-working giant IWG also said it was considering quitting the London stock market in favour of the “deeper market” in the US.IWG, the parent company of Regus and Spaces, said it has switched to reporting its results in dollars and will make a decision by June on adopting American accounting standards.Story continuesChief executive Mark Dixon told the Financial Times: “The final step is to consider moving the listing from [the London Stock Exchange] to one of the US exchanges . . . that is certainly a consideration for the board and our investors at a later stage.”Last night a consortium of the London Stock Exchange Group’s biggest investors announced plans to sell a £1.9bn stake in the business.The Blackstone-led consortium, which includes the Canada Pension Plan and sovereign wealth fund GIC, announced plans to offload 21.5m shares in a quick fire sale, cutting its stake from around 10pc to 6pc.The consortium has cut its stake from 27pc over the past 12 months having become a major investor in the FTSE 100 group following its sale of data group Refinitiv to LSEG. In February, Tui shareholders voted to ditch the company’s London listing and move to Frankfurt. Flutter, the owner of Paddy Power, has also said it plans to move its primary listing to the US.Executives and analysts have blamed the exodus on smaller pay deals in the UK and low valuations.Mr Lowen and Mr Beagles said: “The UK market remains firmly out of favour with international investors”.Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has made efforts to revive the stock market a key focus.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.
