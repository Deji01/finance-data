Financial Analyst The financial results of Cheetah Mobile Inc. reflect a steady performance with revenues aligning with their projected guidance.

This could position Cheetah Mobile favorably in a competitive landscape. However, investors should consider the risk associated with integrating new technologies and the company's ability to monetize these advancements effectively. Additionally, the market's response to such strategic shifts and the company's execution of its vision will be critical in determining the long-term value creation for shareholders.

The Notes will bear interest at 3.70% per annum, payable annually in arrears. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including aircraft purchases and debt repayment. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Air Lease Corporation regarding the pricing of its €600 million offering of senior unsecured medium-term notes with a 3.70% interest rate, maturing in 2030, is a significant event for investors and the company's financial strategy. The interest rate offered is a reflection of the company's creditworthiness and current market conditions. It's pertinent to compare this rate with the average yield of corporate bonds in the same sector and rating category to assess the attractiveness of the offering. Additionally, the use of proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the potential purchase of commercial aircraft and repayment of debt, indicates an ongoing strategy to manage the company's capital structure efficiently.Investors should consider the implications of the currency in which the Notes will be paid. Payments in Euros suggest a strategy to align debt obligations with revenue streams, possibly derived from European operations, or to take advantage of currency diversification. The closing of the offering is subject to customary conditions, which typically include regulatory approvals and the absence of any material adverse changes in the company's business. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the involvement of prominent financial institutions as joint book-running managers indicates a strong interest in the offering and potentially a positive market reception. The role of these institutions often involves gauging investor demand and setting the price of the offering, which can influence the success of the issuance. The fact that the offering is being made under an effective shelf registration statement allows for a quicker response to market conditions and can be seen as a strategic move by Air Lease Corporation to capitalize on favorable borrowing terms.Furthermore, the allocation of proceeds towards the purchase of commercial aircraft could signal an anticipation of growth in the aviation leasing industry or the need to replace older models with newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft. This could have implications for the company's competitive position and future revenue streams. The repayment of existing indebtedness is a common use of such proceeds and could improve the company's debt profile and interest expense, potentially leading to improved financial ratios and credit ratings. Debt Market Analyst Examining the structure of the Notes, the senior unsecured nature suggests that they rank higher in the event of liquidation compared to subordinated debt, yet do not have the security of collateralized obligations. This positioning in the company's capital hierarchy affects the risk profile of the Notes. Investors in the debt market will scrutinize the credit rating of the offering and the company's overall debt levels to determine the risk-reward balance. The tenor of the Notes, maturing in 2030, provides a medium-term investment horizon that can appeal to investors looking for stability beyond the short-term volatility of markets.The annual interest payment structure is relatively standard, but the fixed rate of 3.70% locks in the cost of borrowing for Air Lease Corporation, which can be advantageous in a rising interest rate environment. However, it also means the company will not benefit from potential future decreases in interest rates. As the payments are in Euros, investors should be mindful of the currency risk involved, especially those based in jurisdictions with different base currencies. 03/21/2024 - 01:19 AM LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Air Lease Corporation (NYSE: AL) (the “Company”) announced the pricing on March 20, 2024 of its offering of €600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.70% senior unsecured medium-term notes due April 15, 2030 (the “Notes”).

Owners of the Notes will receive payments relating to the Notes in Euros. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, the purchase of commercial aircraft and the repayment of existing indebtedness.

(""Great Pacific Gold,” “GPAC,” or the ""Company"") (TSXV: GPAC) (OTCQX: FSXLF) (Germany: 4TU) is pleased to announce high-grade gold assays from its initial follow up diamond drill hole of the Comet gold discovery at the Lauriston Gold Project in Victoria, Australia. Diamond drill hole CDH01A intersected 4m at 25.1 g/t Gold from 99.5m including 0.4m at 72.5 g/t Gold from 99.5m and 1m at 55 g/t Gold from 102.5m, within a broader interval assaying 9m at 11.6 g/t Au from 97m. The high-grade intercept occurs within the core of the Comet Anticline at the fold axis, where the Comet Fault zone junctions with this fold. This high-grade gold mineralization is associated with strong quartz veining with large crystals of arsenopyrite and sulphidic stylolites within the quartz veins. Visible gold is occasionally present within the arsenopyrite crystals. Figure 1 - Example of CDH01A drill core annotated with gold grades in g/t. Core tray is 100m to 104.23m The Company set up diamond drill hole CDH01A in close proximity of the high-grade reverse circulation (RC) percussion discovery hole CRC07 (8m at 106 g/t Gold including 5m at 166 g/t Gold including 2m at 413 g/t Gold including 1m at 468 g/t Gold and 1m at 358 g/t Gold (from 95 metres) (see news release January 11, 2024)) as a conservative approach to determine extensions of mineralization. The hole CDH01A deviated once underway, steepening with depth and managed to drill about 8m down dip of the projected position of the CRC07 intercept. Diamond drilling has confirmed the gold rich quartz veined fault zone is extending to depth and laterally with this CDH01A result, and the high-grade mineralization remains open in all directions. Assays remain pending for two more diamond drill holes on the same section at Comet and will be reported once received. One of these diamond drill holes (CDH02) encountered multiple stacked zones of mineralization and due to this was extended by approximately 100m versus the originally planned target depth. CDH02 was drilled to 255.5m depth. GPAC Chief Operating Officer and Director, Rex Motton, states, “The high-grade gold intercept in our first diamond drilling, post the reverse circulation discovery hole at Comet, is a great start to the program. In addition to the high-grade gold interval in the first diamond drill hole assaying 4 metres at 25.1 grams per tonne gold within a broader 9 meter mineralized zone, we also are very pleased with early information from the second hole. While no assays have been received for the second hole, it has already shown importance geologically as multiple zones of mineralization were encountered. The second hole, which was originally planned to a target depth of approximately 150 metres was continued until approximately 255 metres based on these stacked zones of mineralization encountered. We see this as early days for this extensive and highly prospective structure.” The Comet prospect has epizonal characteristics of Au-As-Sb with geology similar to the Fosterville Mine gold deposit. The west dipping Comet fault zone is hosted by Ordovician slates and sandstones, which are folded in a series of north south striking concertina folds. This high-grade discovery is within the core of the Comet Anticline as determined by mapping and core orientation studies, which is a similar structural setting of the mineralization present at Fosterville.

The quality control results are consistent. About GPAC Great Pacific Gold has a portfolio of high-grade gold projects in Papua New Guinea (“PNG”) and Australia. In PNG, Great Pacific Gold recently acquired a significant 2,166 sq. km mineral exploration land package in PNG. The land package comprises of exploration licenses (EL) and exploration license applications (ELA). It includes both early-stage and advanced-stage exploration targets with high-grade epithermal vein and porphyry-style mineralisation present. The Arau Project consists of two exploration licenses, located in the Kainantu region, and includes the Mt. Victor Prospect, where previous drilling found a multiple phase intrusion complex hosting copper and gold mineralisation. The Wild Dog Project consists of one granted exploration license, EL 2761, and one exploration license application, ELA 2516, located on the island of New Britain and about 50 km southwest of Rabaul and Kokopo, PNG. The Kesar Creek Project consists of one exploration license, EL 2711, and is contiguous with the K92 Mining Inc. tenements. In Australia, Great Pacific Gold began with two, 100% owned, high-grade gold projects called the Lauriston and Golden Mountain Projects, and has since acquired a large area of granted and application tenements containing further epizonal (low-temperature) high-grade gold mineralisation and associated intrusion-related gold mineralization all in the state of Victoria, Australia. The Great Pacific Gold land package, assembled over a multi-year period, notably includes the Lauriston Project which is a 535 sq. km property immediately to the south of and within the same geological framework that hosts Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd’s Fosterville Gold Mine and associated exploration tenements. The Golden Mountain Project is an intrusion-related gold project on the edge of the Strathbogie granite and occurs at the northern end of the Walhalla Gold Belt. The acquired projects include the epizonal gold Providence Project containing the Reedy Creek goldfield which adjoins the Southern Cross Gold’s Sunday Creek exploration project and a large group of recently consolidated granted tenements called the Walhalla Gold Belt Project, which contain a variety of epizonal and intrusion related style gold mineralisation. Additionally, Great Pacific Gold has another gold-focused project called the Moormbool project which has epizonal style gold mineralisation and associated potential intrusion-related gold mineralisation, as well as the Beechworth Project occurs in the northeast of the state and contains intrusion related and mesozonal gold mineralization. All GPAC’s properties in Australia are 100% owned and have had historical gold production from hard rock sources despite limited modern exploration and drilling.

The company's cash position stands at €102.3 million as of December 31, 2023, with a cash runway to the end of 2025. Positive Positive final results of lacutamab TELLOMAK Phase 2 trial in Sézary syndrome presented at ASH Annual Meeting 2023 Licensing of a fourth NK cell engager ANKET® by Sanofi, triggering a €15m payment to Innate First patient dosed in Phase 1/2 clinical trial with IPH6501 in B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma New Executive Board formed with key appointments Cash position of €102.3 million as of December 31, 2023, with anticipated cash runway to end of 2025 Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial report from Innate Pharma SA highlights a stable cash position and a robust pipeline with several molecules in different stages of clinical development. The licensing agreement with Sanofi, resulting in a €15m payment, is a positive development, enhancing financial stability and providing non-dilutive funding to support ongoing research and development efforts. Furthermore, the anticipated cash runway extending to the end of 2025 indicates prudent financial management and may reduce the immediate need for further capital raise, which is often a concern for investors in biotech companies. However, the actual impact on the stock market would depend on the investor perception of the pipeline's potential and the execution of the clinical programs. Medical Research Analyst The positive final results of the lacutamab TELLOMAK Phase 2 trial in Sézary syndrome and the advancement of the ANKET® platform with multiple molecules in clinical trials underscore Innate Pharma's progress in developing novel cancer therapeutics. The lifting of the FDA's partial clinical hold on the lacutamab IND is a significant regulatory milestone that may bolster investor confidence in the drug's future prospects. However, the decision to not reopen the Phase 1b trial for lacutamab in PTCL due to insufficient clinical activity suggests a need for strategic pivoting, possibly towards combination therapies, which could impact the long-term potential of the drug. The progress of monalizumab in the Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 trial is another critical aspect to monitor, as success in this trial could lead to a new treatment option for NSCLC patients and a significant market opportunity. Market Research Analyst Innate Pharma's partnerships and licensing agreements, particularly with Sanofi, are indicative of the industry's interest in NK cell engagers and the company's proprietary ANKET® platform. The €15m payment from Sanofi, along with potential future milestone payments and royalties, could provide a recurring revenue stream that supports Innate's valuation. The continued development of the ANKET® platform, especially with the first patient dosed in the Phase 1/2 trial with IPH6501, positions Innate in a competitive space within immuno-oncology, with the potential to capture market share in the treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. The company's strategic focus on antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) and the licensing agreement with Takeda also highlight the diversification of Innate's portfolio, which may appeal to investors looking for companies with multiple shots on goal. 03/21/2024 - 02:00 AM Positive final results of lacutamab TELLOMAK Phase 2 trial in Sézary syndrome presented at ASH Annual Meeting 2023; final data in mycosis fungoides to be shared at an upcoming medical congress Licensing of a fourth NK cell engager ANKET® by Sanofi, triggering a €15m payment to Innate; ANKET® partnered assets progressing well with two molecules in clinical trials First patient dosed in Phase 1/2 clinical trial with IPH6501, a proprietary second generation ANKET® in B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma IPH45, a pre-IND anti-Nectin-4 Antibody Drug Conjugate, selected for oral presentation at AACR 2024 New Executive Board formed with Hervé Brailly, interim Chief Executive Officer, Yannis Morel, Chief Operating Officer, Sonia Quaratino, Chief Medical Officer, and Arvind Sood, President of US Operations Cash position of €102.3 million1 as of December 31, 2023 excluding the €15m from Sanofi, anticipated cash runway to end of 2025 Conference call to be held today at 2:00 p.m. CET / 9:00 a.m. EDT MARSEILLE, France--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News: Innate Pharma SA (Euronext Paris: IPH; Nasdaq: IPHA) (“Innate” or the “Company”) today reported its consolidated financial results for the year ending December 31, 2023.

Looking ahead to 2024, we expect notable milestones including final results from the TELLOMAK Phase 2 trial with lacutamab in mycosis fungoides, and progressing our first proprietary ADC program, IPH45 towards an IND filing.” Webcast and conference call will be held today at 2:00pm CET (9:00am EDT) Access to live webcast: https://events.q4inc.com/attendee/435604632 Participants may also join via telephone using the registration link below: https://registrations.events/direct/Q4I409542 This information can also be found on the Investors section of the Innate Pharma website, www.innate-pharma.com. A replay of the webcast will be available on the Company website for 90 days following the event. 1 Including short term investments (€21.9m) and non-current financial instruments (€9.8m). Pipeline highlights: Lacutamab (anti-KIR3DL2 antibody): Cutaneous T Cell lymphoma Innate reported positive final data from the Phase 2 TELLOMAK study in Sézary syndrome at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2023 Annual Congress. Data demonstrate that lacutamab showed robust clinical activity and an overall favorable safety profile. In this heavily pre-treated population, post-mogamulizumab, with a median of five prior lines of therapy, the global confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 37.5% (21/56). Confirmed ORR in the skin was 46.4% (26/56) and confirmed ORR in the blood was 48.2% (27/56). Median progression-free survival was 8.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.7-21.2). In 2023, Innate reported interim data with lacutamab in mycosis fungoides (MF) patients at the EORTC Cutaneous Lymphoma Tumour Group Annual Meeting (September 2023) and the 17th International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma (June 2023). The interim data set confirmed clinical activity and favorable safety profile of lacutamab in line with the Phase 1 data. The top-line results in MF patients are currently being analyzed and Innate intends to present the data in 2024 at a medical conference. In January 2024, Innate announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has lifted the partial clinical hold previously placed on the lacutamab IND on October 2023 following a patient death in the TELLOMAK study. The FDA decision to lift the partial clinical hold is based on the FDA review of the fatal case which Innate, together with a steering committee of independent experts, determined to be related to aggressive disease progression and lacutamab unrelated. Peripheral T Cell lymphoma (PTCL) Despite objective responses observed, the Company-sponsored Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating lacutamab as monotherapy in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing refractory/relapsing PTCL will not be reopened to recruitment as the prespecified threshold for meaningful clinical activity was not reached. At the ASH Annual Congress 2023, Innate presented a poster with preclinical data demonstrating a synergistic effect between lacutamab and chemotherapy in preclinical models of PTCL, supporting the rationale for combination strategy in this clinical indication. The Phase 2 KILT (anti-KIR in T Cell Lymphoma) trial, an investigator-sponsored, randomized trial led by the Lymphoma Study Association (LYSA) to evaluate lacutamab in combination with chemotherapy GEMOX (gemcitabine in combination with oxaliplatin) versus GEMOX alone in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing relapsed/refractory PTCL is ongoing. ANKET® (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics): ANKET® is Innate’s proprietary platform for developing next-generation, multi-specific NK cell engagers to treat certain types of cancer. Innate’s pipeline includes five public drug candidates born from the ANKET® platform: SAR443579 (SAR’579/IPH6101) (CD123-targeted), SAR445514 (SAR’514/IPH6401) (BCMA-targeted), IPH62 (B7-H3-targeted), IPH67 (target undisclosed, solid tumors) and tetra-specific IPH6501 (CD20-targeted with IL-2v). Several other undisclosed proprietary preclinical targets are being explored. SAR’579, SAR’514, IPH62 and IPH67 (partnered with Sanofi) SAR443579/IPH6101 The Phase 1/2 clinical trial by Sanofi is progressing well, evaluating SAR443579 / IPH6101, a trifunctional anti-CD123 NKp46×CD16 NK cell engager and ANKET® platform lead asset, in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML), B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS). At the ASH Annual Congress 2023, Sanofi reported updated efficacy and safety results and data across all dose levels tested for SAR443579. As of October 23, 2023, 43 patients (42 R/R AML and 1 HR-MDS) across 8 Dose Levels (DLs) at 10 – 6000 μg/kg/dose were included. Patients had received a median of 2.0 (1.0 – 10.0) prior lines of treatment with 13 patients (30.2%) reporting prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and 36 patients (83.7%) with prior exposure to venetoclax. In DLs with a highest dose of 1000 μg/kg QW, 5/15 AML (33.3%) patients achieved a CR (4 CR / 1 CRi) as of the cut-off date. As of the data cut-off on October 23, 2023, two responders remain in remission after more than 12 and 14 months of treatment. SAR443579 was well tolerated up to doses of 6000 μg/kg QW with observed clinical benefit in patients with R/R AML. The results are consistent with the predicted favorable safety profile. Preliminary Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamic (PD) Analysis of the CD123 NK Cell Engager SAR’579/IPH6101 in patients with relapsed or refractory AML, B-ALL or HR-MDS were presented during the ESMO (European Society for Medical Oncology) Congress 2023. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track Designation for SAR’579 / IPH6101 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. SAR’514/IPH6401 The Phase 1/2 clinical trial with SAR’514 / IPH6401, a trifunctional anti-BCMA Nkp46xCD16 NK cell engager, led by Sanofi, in patients with Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma and Relapsed/Refractory Light-chain Amyloidosis is ongoing. IPH62 As announced on December 19, 2022, Sanofi licensed IPH62, a NK cell engager program targeting B7-H3 from Innate’s ANKET® platform. Upon candidate selection, Sanofi will be responsible for all development, manufacturing and commercialization. Under the terms of the research collaboration and license agreement signed in December 2022, Innate received a €25m upfront payment and is eligible for up to €1.35bn total in preclinical, clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones plus royalties on potential net sales. IPH67 In December 2023, Sanofi exercised its option to license a NK cell engager program in solid tumors from Innate’s ANKET® platform pursuant to the terms of the research collaboration and license agreement signed in December 2022. Following a research collaboration period, Sanofi will be responsible for all development, manufacturing and commercialization. Sanofi still retains the option to one additional ANKET® target. Innate received a €15m payment as option exercise. IPH6501 (proprietary) In March 2024 the first patient was dosed in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating IPH6501, Innate’s proprietary CD20-targeted IL-2v bearing second-generation ANKET® in B cell Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (B-NHL). The study is ongoing and planned to enroll up to 184 patients. Innate presented preclinical data on IPH6501 at the European Hematology Association (EHA) 2023 congress. In preclinical settings, IPH6501 was shown to induce NK cell proliferation and to trigger high NK cell cytotoxicity against CD20+ target cells in in vitro assays, in ex vivo assays with relapse/refractory (R/R) B-NHL patient samples who received at least one prior treatment, as well as in in vivo studies in non-human primates. A surrogate of IPH6501 mediated a potent anti-tumor activity in vivo in CD20+ tumor models in mice. In addition, in ex vivo assays with R/R B-NHL patient samples, IPH6501 was shown to be more efficient than a T-cell engager targeting CD20. Monalizumab (anti-NKG2A antibody), partnered with AstraZeneca: The Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 trial run by AstraZeneca evaluating durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) in combination with monalizumab or AstraZeneca’s oleclumab (anti-CD73) in patients with unresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not progressed following definitive platinum-based concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT) is ongoing. IPH5201 (anti-CD39), partnered with AstraZeneca: The MATISSE Phase 2 clinical trial conducted by Innate in neoadjuvant lung cancer for IPH5201, an anti-CD39 blocking monoclonal antibody developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca, is ongoing and recruitment is on track. IPH5301 (anti-CD73): The investigator-sponsored CHANCES Phase 1 trial of IPH5301 by Institut Paoli-Calmettes is ongoing. Antibody Drug Conjugates: Fueling its R&D pipeline, Innate continues to develop different approaches for the treatment of cancer utilizing its antibody engineering capabilities to deliver novel assets, with its innovative ANKET® platform and exploring Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADC) formats. Beyond its proprietary programs, Innate has an ongoing agreement with Takeda on ADCs. IPH45 (Nectin-4 ADC): IPH45 is Innate’s proprietary Nectin-4 targeting antibody drug conjugate including a Topoisomerase I inhibitor payload. IPH45 continues towards IND filing this year. Innate will share first preclinical data with IPH45 in an oral presentation at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) 2024. Takeda license agreement: In April 2023, Innate announced that it has entered into an exclusive license agreement with Takeda under which Innate grants Takeda exclusive worldwide rights to research and develop antibody drug conjugates (ADC) using a panel of selected Innate antibodies against an undisclosed target, with a primary focus in Celiac disease. Under the terms of the license agreement, Innate received a $5m upfront payment and is eligible to receive up to $410m in future development, regulatory and commercial milestones if all milestones are achieved during the term of the agreement, plus royalties on potential net sales of any commercial product resulting from the license. Corporate Update: On April 26, 2023, Innate announced the establishment of an At-The-Market (ATM) program, pursuant to which it may, from time to time, offer and sell to eligible investors a total gross amount of up to $75 million American Depositary Shares (“ADS”). Each ADS representing one ordinary share of Innate. As of December 31, 2023, the balance available under our April 2023 sales agreement remains at $75 million. Dr. Sonia Quaratino, MD, PhD, has been appointed as Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Innate Pharma, effective October 2023. On December 18, 2023, Innate announced that Mondher Mahjoubi has resigned from his position as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chairman of the Executive Board of the Company, effective as of January 2024. Hervé Brailly, Innate Pharma’s Chairman of the Supervisory Board, former CEO and co-founder was appointed as interim CEO and Chairman of the Executive Board while a permanent successor is sought. Irina Staatz-Granzer, who has been Vice-Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board for several years was appointed Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board. Post period event Early January 2024, Innate announced that it has strengthened the Company’s leadership and corporate governance with the appointment of two new Executive Board members. Arvind Sood, Executive Vice President (EVP), President of US Operations, Dr Sonia Quaratino, EVP, Chief Medical Officer, joining Hervé Brailly, interim Chief Executive Officer and Yannis Morel, EVP, appointed Chief Operating Officer. Innate announced that Arvind Sood had joined the Company in a newly created position of Executive Vice President and President of US Operations. Financial highlights for 2023: The key elements of Innate’s financial position and financial results as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 are as follows: Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and financial assets amounting to €102.3 million (€m) as of December 31, 2023 (€136.6m as of December 31, 2022), including financial instruments amounting to €9.8m (€35.1m as of December 31, 2022). Cash, cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 do not include the €15.0 million payment made by Sanofi following the exercise of the license option announced in December 2023. This amount was received by the Company in January 2024. As of December 31, 2023, financial liabilities amount to €39.9m (€42.3m as of December 31, 2022). This change is mainly due to loan repayments. Revenue and other income from continuing operations amounted to €61.6m in 2023 (2022: €57.7m, +6.9%). It mainly comprises revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements (€51.9m in 2023 vs €49.6m in 2022, +4.7%), and research tax credit (€9.7m in 2023 vs €7.9m in 2022, +22.8%): Revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements, which mainly resulted from the partial or entire recognition of the proceeds received pursuant to the agreements with AstraZeneca, Sanofi and Takeda. They results from the partial or entire recognition of the proceeds received pursuant to the agreements with AstraZeneca, Sanofi and Takeda. They are recognized when the entity's performance obligation is met. Their accounting is made at a point in time or spread over time according to the percentage of completion of the work that the Company is committed to carry out under these agreements: (i) Revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements for monalizumab decreased by €12.9m to €9.5m in 2023 ( €22.4m in 2022). This change mainly results from the transaction price increase of €13.4m ($14.0m), in the first half of 2022, triggered by the launch of the “PACIFIC-9” Phase 3 trial announced on April 29, 2022. As a reminder, this increase in the transaction price generated a €12.6 million favorable cumulative adjustment in the revenue related to monalizumab agreements as of December 31,2022; (ii) Revenue related to the research collaboration and licensing agreement signed with Sanofi in 2022 amounted €34.7m as of December 31, 2023. On January 25, 2023, the Company announced the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the effectiveness of the licensing agreement as of January 24, 2023. Consequently, the Company received an upfront payment of €25.0m in March 2023, including €18.5m for the exclusive license, €1.5m for the research work and €5.0m for the two additional targets options, for which the Company will recognize the related revenues either at the reporting date or three years after the effective date. The €18.5m upfront payment relating to the exclusive license has been fully recognized in revenue since June 30, 2023. On December 19, 2023, the Company announced that Sanofi had exercised one of the two license options for a new program based on the Company's ANKET® platform. This decision triggered a milestone payment of €15.0m, including €13.3m for the exclusive license, fully recognized in revenue as of December 31, 2023, and €1.7m for research work to be carried out by the Company as well as the recognition in revenue of an amount of €2.5m initially received in March 2023 in connection with this option; (iii) Revenue related to the license and collaboration agreement signed with Sanofi in 2016 decreased by €2.0m, to €2.0m for year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to €4.0m for year ended December 31, 2022. The Company announced that, in June 2023, the first patient was dosed in a Sanofi-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating SAR'514/IPH6401 in relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma. As provided by the licensing agreement signed in 2016, Sanofi made a milestone payment of €2.0 million, fully recognized in revenue since of June 30, 2023. This amount was received by the Company on July 21, 2023. As a reminder, the revenue recognized 2022 mainly resulted from Sanofi's decision to advance SAR'514/IPH6401 into investigational new drug (IND)- enabling studies. This decision triggered a €3.0 million milestone payment from Sanofi to the Company, fully recognized in revenue as of June 30, 2022; (iv) Revenue related to the licensing agreement signed with Takeda in 2023 amounted €4.6m for year ended December 31, 2023. On April 3, 2023, the Company announced that it has entered into an exclusive license agreement with Takeda under which Innate grants Takeda exclusive worldwide rights to research and develop antibody drug conjugates (ADC) using a panel of selected Innate antibodies against an undisclosed target, with a primary focus in Celiac disease. Takeda will be responsible for the future development, manufacture and commercialization of any potential products developed using the licensed antibodies. As such, the Company considers that the license granted is a right to use the intellectual property, which is granted fully and perpetually to Takeda. The agreement does not stipulate that Innate's activities will significantly affect the intellectual property granted during the life of the agreement. Consequently, the $5.0m (or €4.6m) initial payment, received by the Company in May 2023, was fully recognized in revenue since June 30, 2023. The research tax credit (CIR) of €9.7m of as December 31, 2023 (€7.9m for year ended December 31 December, 2022, including 2022 fiscal year CIR for an amount of €9.2 million reduced by €1.3 million related to a provision following the tax inspection carried out in 2022 by the French tax authorities). Operating expenses from continuing operations and before impairment amounted to €74.3m in 2023 (2022: €74.1m, +0.3%): General and administrative (G&A) expenses from continuing activities amounted to €18.3m in 2023 (2022: €22.4m, -18.5%). This variation results cumulatively from (i) a reduction in personnel expenses, (ii) a reduction in non-scientific fees, (iii) the pursuit of cost savings (reduction in office space), (iv) a reclassification of expenses relating to the support of R&D laboratory activities (maintenance, depreciation of R&D equipment) in the amount of €1.0 million. Research and development (R&D) expenses from continuing activities amounted to €56.0m in 2023 (2022: €51.7m, +8.4%). This change was mainly due to an increase in direct research and development expenses, notably for non-clinical development programs, partially offset by a decrease in expenses for clinical programs over the period. Indirect research and development expenses increased, mainly in the fields of personnel costs and depreciation, amortization and impairment. As a reminder, as of December 31, 2022, the Company recognized the full impairment of the avdoralimab intangible asset (anti-C5aR rights) for an amount of €41,0m (non-cash expense) following the Company’s decision to stop avdoralimab development in bullous pemphigoid indication in inflammation. A net financial income of €5.1m in 2023 (2022: €0.5m loss). Net income from Lumoxiti discontinued operations are nil for year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to a net loss of €0.1m for year ended December 31, 2022 corresponding to residual costs associated with the transfer of activities to AstraZeneca. This transfer has now been completed. A net loss of €7.6m in 2023 (2022: net loss of €58.1m). The table below summarizes the IFRS consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, including 2022 comparative information.

These revenues mainly result from the partial or entire recognition of the proceeds received pursuant to the agreements with AstraZeneca, Sanofi and Takeda. They are recognized when the entity's performance obligation is met. Their accounting is made at a point in time or spread over time according to the percentage of completion of the work that the Company is committed to carry out under these agreements. The evolution in 2023 is mainly due to: A €12.9 million decrease in revenue related to monalizumab to €9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to €22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease is mainly explained by the transaction price increase of €13.4 million ($14.0 million) in the first half of 2022 triggered by the launch of the “PACIFIC-9” Phase 3 trial on April 28, 2022. As a reminder, this change in the transaction price generated a €12.6 million favorable cumulative adjustment in the revenue related to monalizumab agreements over the period. As of December 31, 2023, the deferred revenue related to monalizumab amounts to €5.2 million entirely classified as “Deferred revenue—Current portion” in connection with the maturity of Phase 1/2 trials; Revenue related to IPH5201 are nil for the year ended December 31, 2023. The €4.7 million revenue for year ended December 31, 2022 resulted from the entire recognition in revenue of the $5.0 million milestone payment received from AstraZeneca following the signature on June 1, 2022 of an amendment to the initial contract signed in October 2018. As a reminder, this amendment sets the terms of the collaboration following AstraZeneca’s decision to advance IPH5201 to a Phase 2 study. The Company conducts the study. Both parties share the external cost related to the study and incurred by the Company and AstraZeneca provides products necessary to conduct the clinical trial; As a reminder, during the 2022 first semester, the Company received from AstraZeneca a notice that it will not exercise its option to license the four preclinical programs covered in the ""Future Programs Option Agreement"". This option agreement was part of the 2018 multi-term agreement between AstraZeneca and the Company under which the Company received an upfront payment of $20.0 million (€17.4m). Innate has now regained full rights to further develop the four preclinical molecules. Consequently, the entire initial payment of $20.0 million, or €17.4 million was recognized as revenue as of June 30, 2022; The recognition of €34.7 million in revenue as of December 31, 2023, relating to the research collaboration and licensing agreement signed with Sanofi in 2022. On January 25, 2023, the Company announced the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the effectiveness of the licensing agreement as of January 24, 2023. Consequently, the Company received an upfront payment of €25.0m in March 2023, including €18.5m for the exclusive license, €1.5m for the research work and €5.0m for the two additional targets options, for which the Company will recognize the related revenues either at the reporting date or three years after the effective date. The €18.5m upfront payment relating to the exclusive license has been fully recognized in revenue since June 30, 2023. On December 19, 2023, the Company announced that Sanofi had exercised one of the two license options for a new program based on the Company's ANKET® platform. This decision triggered a milestone payment of €15.0m, including €13.3m for the exclusive license, fully recognized in revenue as of December 31, 2023, and €1.7m for research work to be carried out by the Company. Following the notification of the exercise of the option, the Company also recognized in revenue an amount of €2.5m initially received in March 2023 and related to this option. The cumulative payments of €3.2m received for research work are recognized on a straight-line basis over the duration of the research work that the Company has agreed to carry out. As of December 31, 2023, the Company recognize in revenue an amount of €0.4 million based on the stage of completion of this work. The remaining amount of €2.8 million is recognized in deferred-revenue. Sanofi still retains a license option for an additional ANKET® target, in accordance with the license agreement. Consequently, the corresponding upfront payment is also recognized in deferred-revenue as of December 31, 2023 for an amount of €2.5m; A €2.0 million decrease in revenue from the collaboration and research license agreement with Sanofi, to €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to €4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company announced that, in June 2023, the first patient was dosed in a Sanofi-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating SAR'514/IPH6401 in relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma. As provided by the licensing agreement signed in 2016, Sanofi made a milestone payment of €2.0 million, fully recognized in revenue since of June 30, 2023. This amount was received by the Company on July 21, 2023. As a reminder, the revenue recognized 2022 mainly resulted from Sanofi's decision to advance SAR'514/IPH6401 into investigational new drug (IND)- enabling studies. This decision triggered a €3.0 million milestone payment from Sanofi to the Company, fully recognized in revenue as of June 30, 2022; The recognition of €4.6 million in revenue as of December 31, 2023, relating to the licensing agreement signed with Takeda in 2023. On April 3, 2023, the Company announced that it has entered into an exclusive license agreement with Takeda under which Innate grants Takeda exclusive worldwide rights to research and develop antibody drug conjugates (ADC) using a panel of selected Innate antibodies against an undisclosed target, with a primary focus in Celiac disease. Takeda will be responsible for the future development, manufacture and commercialization of any potential products developed using the licensed antibodies. As such, the Company considers that the license granted is a right to use the intellectual property, which is granted fully and perpetually to Takeda. The agreement does not stipulate that Innate's activities will significantly affect the intellectual property granted during the life of the agreement. Consequently, the $5.0m (or €4.6m) initial payment, received by the Company in May 2023, was fully recognized in revenue since June 30, 2023; A €0.2 million decrease in revenue from invoicing of research and development costs to €1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to €1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Government funding for research expenditures Government funding for research expenditures increased by €1.7 million, or 21.1%, to €9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to €8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, government funding is mainly comprised of research tax credit for for 2023 fiscal year for an amount of €9.8 million as compared to €7.9 million euros for year ended December 31, 2022. As a reminder, the 2022 research tax credit included a reduction of €1.3 million related to a provision following the tax inspection carried out in 2022 by the French tax authorities. This provision was based on estimated amounts and adjustments not disputed by the Company. The change in the research tax credit is due to an increase in eligible expenses explained by (i) the increase in depreciation on IPH5201 rights following the full amortization of the additional payment of €2.0 million to Orega Biotech following the dosing of the first patient in the MATISSE Phase 2 clinical trial, compared with €0.6 million as of December 31, 2022, and (ii) an increase in subcontracting expenses in connection with the IPH6501 program and the launch of work on the Lacutamab program. However, these increases are offset by the decrease in amortization of the monalizumab intangible asset due to the extension of the amortization period, as well as for certain tangible assets which had reached the end of their amortization period, and also by lower R&D personnel costs. The increase in expenses eligible for the research tax credit is also due to the absence of any grants received in 2023, which reduced the eligible base, as compared to 2022, when the eligible base was reduced by the receipt of the remaining repayable advance from the BPI for the amount of €0,7 million to support the independent Phase 2 clinical trial FOR COVID-19 Elimination (FORCE), evaluating the safety and efficacy of avdoralimab in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The research tax credit is calculated as 30% of the amount of research and development expenses, net of grants received, eligible for the research tax credit for the fiscal year. Operating expenses The table below presents our operating expenses from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: In thousands of euros December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Research and development expenses (56,022) (51,663) Selling, general and administrative expenses (18,288) (22,436) Operating expenses (74,310) (74,099) Research and development expenses Research and development (“R&D”) expenses from continuing operations increased by €4.4 million, or 8.4%, to €56.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to €51.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase over the period is mainly due to an increase in direct research and development expenses of €2.7 million over the period due to the significant increase in expenses relating to pre-clinical development programs, partly offset by the decrease in expenses relating to clinical programs. Research and development expenses represented a total of 75.4% and 69.7% of operating expenses for years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Direct research and development expenses increased by €2.7 million, or 9.8%, to €30.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to direct research and development expenses of €27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase is mainly due to: (i) a €3.2 million increase in expenses related to preclinical development programs relating notably to Antibody Drug Conjugates - ADC field, partly offset by a €0.5 million decrease in expenses related to the Company's clinical programs. This decrease in clinical programs expenses mainly results from a €0.4 million decrease in expenses relating to the monalizumab program, a €0.2 million decrease in expenses relating to the avdoralimab program and a €0.2 million decrease in expenses relating to the lacutamab program, partly offset by a €0.7 million increase in expenses related to the growth in IPH5201 Phase 2 trials patient recruitment. Also, as of December 31, 2023, the collaboration liabilities relating to monalizumab and the agreements signed with AstraZeneca in April 2015, October 2018 and September 2020 amounted to €52.7 million, as compared to collaborations liabilities of €63.2 million as of December 31, 2022. This decrease of €10.5m mainly results from (i) net repayment of €8.4 million during year 2023 to AstraZeneca linked to the Monalizumab cofinancing program, including Phase 3 trial INTERLINK-1 launched in October 2020 and PACIFIC-9 launched in April 2022, and (ii) the decrease of the collaboration commitment (""collaboration liabilities"" in the consolidated statements of financial position) for an amount of €2.0 million linked to the Euro-dollar parity exchange rate variation. Personnel and other expenses allocated to research and development increased by €1.7 million, or 6.9%, to €25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to an amount of €24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase is due to the (i) €0.7 million increase in staff costs allocated to research and development, of which €0.5 million in personnel expenses and €0.2 million in share-based payment expenses, (ii) increase of €1.0 million in depreciation and amortization. The line item is mainly composed of the amortization of the monalizumab, IPH5201 intangible assets. General and administrative expenses General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses from continuing operations decreased by €4.1 million, or 18.5% to €18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to €22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. G&A expenses represented a total of 24.6% and 30.3% of the total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Personnel expenses, which include the compensation paid to our employees, decreased by €1.4 million, or 13.6%, to €8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to personnel expenses of €10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease mainly results from a decrease in wages of €1.2 million as well as a decrease of €0.2 million in share-based payment expenses mainly explained by the decrease of employees. Non-scientific advisory and consulting expenses mostly consist of auditing, accounting, legal and hiring services. These expenses decreased by €1.3 million, or 31.5%, to €2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to an amount of €4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease mainly results from operating efficiency measures, which led to a reduction in the number of new hires, and use of external communication and consulting services. Other general and administrative expenses relate to intellectual property, depreciation and amortization and other general, administrative expenses. These expenses decreased by €1.4 million or 17.9% to €6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to an amount of €8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease related notably to savings (reduction in office space) and a reclassification of R&D laboratory support costs (maintenance, depreciation of R&D equipment) for €1.0 million in R&D. Impairment of intangible assets As a reminder, as of December 31, 2022, impairment of intangible assets was linked to the full depreciation of the avdoralimab intangible asset (anti-C5aR rights acquired from Novo/Nordisk A/S) for an amount of €41.0 million (non-cash expense) following Company’s decision to stop the development of avdoralimab in bullous pemphigoid (""BP"") indication in inflammation. Financial income (loss), net We recognized a net financial gain of €5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to €0.5 million net financial loss for the year ended December 31, 2022. This change mainly results from interest income on financial investments (net gain of €2.5 million in 2023), the change in the fair value of certain financial instruments (net gain of €1.6 million in 2023 as compared to a net loss of €1.6 million in 2022) and a net foreign exchange gain of €0.9 million in 2023 as compared to a net foreign exchange gain of €0.8 million in 2022. Net loss from discontinued operations As a reminder, a Termination and Transition Agreement was negotiated and executed, effective as of June 30, 2021 further to the Company's decision to return the rights of Lumoxiti back to AstraZeneca. Consecutively, activities related to Lumoxiti are presented as discontinued operations since October 1, 2021. Thus, the net income from discontinued operations related to Lumoxiti are nil as of December 31, 2023 as compared to a net loss of €0.1 million as of December 31, 2022 corresponding to residual costs associated with the transfer of activities to AstraZeneca. This transfer has now been completed. Balance sheet items Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and financial assets (current and non-current) amounted to €102.3 million as of December 31, 2023, as compared to €136.6 million as of December 31, 2022. Net cash as of December 31, 2023 (cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets less current financial liabilities) amounted to €83.5 million (€99.4 million as of December 31, 2022). The other key balance sheet items as of December 31, 2023 are: Deferred revenue of €10.5 million (including €4.6 million booked as ‘Deferred revenue – non-current portion’) and collaboration liabilities of €52.7 million (including €45.0 million booked as ‘Collaboration liability – non-current portion’) relating to the remainder of the initial payment received from AstraZeneca with respect to monalizumab, not yet recognized as revenue or used to co-fund the research and the development work performed by AstraZeneca including co-funding of the monalizumab program with AstraZeneca, notably the INTERLINK-1 and PACIFIC-9 Phase 3 trials; Intangible assets for a net book value of €0.4 million, mainly corresponding to the rights and licenses relating to the acquisitions of monalizumab (€1.6 million as of December 30, 2022); variation between the two periods is mainly explained by depreciation of NKG2A asset over the period; Current receivables of €55.6 million, including €29.8 million from the French government related to the research tax credit for the 2019 and 2020 tax years, for which the three-year period expired on December 31, 2023. The CIR repayment for 2019 for an amount of €16.7 million was made in February 2024. The repayment of the 2020 CIR is expected in 2024 for an amount of €13.0 million. Current receivables also include the €15.0 million invoice issued in December 2023 following the exercise of the license option by Sanofi. This amount was received by the Company in January 2024; Non-current receivables of €10.6 million from the French government mainly resulting from the 2023 research tax credit (€9.8 million); Shareholders’ equity of €51.9 million, including the net loss of the period of €7.6 million; Financial liabilities amounting to €39.9 million (€42.3 million as of December 31, 2022). Cash-flow items The net cash flow used over the year ended December 31, 2023 amounted to €13.6 million, compared to a net cash flow used of €19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The net cash flow used during the period under review mainly results from the following: Net cash used from operating activities of €32.6 million, mainly explained by (i) the receipt of €25.0 million from Sanofi in March 2023 following the entry into force of the research collaboration and licensing agreement signed in December 2022 under which the Company granted Genzyme Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanofi (""Sanofi"") an exclusive licence to Innate Pharma's B7H3 ANKET® program and options on two additional targets, (ii) the receipt in May 2023 of a payment of €4.6 million ($5,0 million) received from Takeda following the conclusion of an exclusive licensing agreement under which Innate grants Takeda exclusive worldwide rights for the research and development of antibody conjugates (Antibodu Drug Conjugates - ADC), (iii) the receipt in July 2023 of €2.0 million following the treatment of the first patient in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial sponsored by Sanofi evaluating IPH6401/SAR'514 in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Lastly, (iv) during 2023, the Company benefited from the early repayment of the research tax credit claim relating to the 2022 financial year, amounting to €9.2 million, paid to the Company by the French Treasury in July 2023. As a reminder, cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, included successive (i) the collection of €47.7 million ($50.0 million) and €4.6 million ($5.0 million) in June 2022 and August 2022,respectively, under the monalizumab agreement and the amendment to the IPH5201 collaboration and option agreement, (ii) the collection of €3.0 million received from Sanofi under the 2016 agreement and following Sanofi's decision to advance IPH6401/SAR'514 into regulatory preclinical studies for an investigational new drug, and (iii) in 2022, the Company collected the early repayment of the research tax credit receivable relating to the 2021 financial year for an amount of €10.3 million, paid to the Company by the French Treasury in November 2022. These collections were partially offset by the €5.9 million payment to AstraZeneca on April 20, 2022 pursuant to the Lumoxiti termination and transition agreement and cash outflows related to the Company's operating activities. Not considering these specific effects , net cash flows used by operating activities for the year ended December, 2023 decreased by €5.5 million. This decrease is mainly explained by the decrease in the Company's research and development activities, notably related to preclinical trials, and also by higher cash outflows related to the re-invoicing of costs to AstraZeneca for the Phase 3 trials evaluating monalizumab, INTERLINK-1 and PACIFIC-9, in accordance with the Company's co-financing commitments and the reduction in staff costs related to the reduction of staff in the Company. Also, net cash flow consumed by operating activities in connection with the Lumoxiti discontinued operation are nil for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to € 5.1 million for the year 2022. In 2022, the cash consumption related to the payment to AstraZeneca of €5.9 million in April 2022 under the termination and transition agreement for Lumoxiti. Net cash generated in investing activities for an amount of €20.6 million, mainly composed of a disposal of a non-current financial instrument which generated a net cash collection of €22.8 million partially offset by acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of €2.2 million. As a reminder, net cash flow used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 amounted to €1.9 million and were mainly comprised of a disposal of a non-current financial instrument which generated a net cash collection of €2.9 million partially offset by acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for €1.1 million. Net cash flows consumed by investing activities in connection with the Lumoxiti discontinued operation are nil for year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31 2022, respectively. Net cash flows from financing activities for an amount of €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to net cash flows from financing activities of €1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Loan repayments amounted to €2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net proceeds from the exercise or subscription of equity instruments amount to €0.4 million for year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to €0,2 million for year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, net cash flow from financing activities related to Lumoxiti discontinued operation are nil for year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Post period event On January 4, 2024, the Company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has lifted the partial clinical hold placed on the lacutamab IND. On October 5, the Company announced that the lacutamab IND has been placed on partial clinical hold by FDA following a recent patient death in the TELLOMAK study. The death of a patient affected by Sézary Syndrome was initially considered due to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a rare hematologic disorder. The FDA decision to lift the partial clinical hold is based on the FDA review of the fatal case which Innate, together with a steering committee of independent experts, determined to be related to aggressive disease progression and lacutamab unrelated. On January 4, 2024, the company announced that it has strengthened the Company’s leadership and corporate governance with the appointment of two new Executive Board members. Arvind Sood, Executive Vice President (EVP), President of US Operations, Dr Sonia Quaratino, EVP, Chief Medical Officer are thus joining Hervé Brailly, interim Chief Executive Officer and Yannis Morel, EVP, Chief Operating Officer. On March, 6, the Company announced the first patient was dosing in its Phase 1/2 multicenter trial (NCT06088654), investigating the safety and tolerability of IPH6501 in patients with Relapsed and/or Refractory CD20-expressing B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL). IPH6501 is Innate’s first-in-class CD20-targeting tetraspecific ANKET® (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics) that co-engages CD20 as a target antigen on malignant B cells and three receptors on NK cells.

Negative None. Financial Analyst VEON's reported revenue and EBITDA figures indicate a complex financial landscape. The organic growth in local currency is a positive sign, showing resilience and potential in VEON's core markets. However, the reported decline in EBITDA in USD terms is concerning and reflects the impact of currency fluctuations on the company's financials. The decrease in capex suggests a strategic reduction in spending, which could be a move to improve free cash flow and reduce debt, as indicated by the substantial YoY gross debt decrease.Investors should consider the implications of the improved leverage ratio, from 2.4x to 1.4x, which is a significant reduction in debt relative to EBITDA. This improvement in financial health could enhance VEON's creditworthiness and potentially lead to lower borrowing costs in the future. The guidance for FY 2024 indicates confidence in the company's growth trajectory, although it is critical to monitor how the expected slowdown in inflation might impact consumer spending and, consequently, VEON's service revenues. Market Research Analyst The emphasis on VEON's digital operator strategy and the growth in monthly active users of its digital products highlight the company's commitment to expanding its digital services. This strategic pivot is likely in response to the increasing demand for digital services like financial technology, entertainment, healthcare and education, especially in emerging markets where VEON operates.The market should note VEON's positioning to capture wallet share in these areas, which could lead to sustained revenue growth if executed effectively. The digital transformation efforts, including AI-focused initiatives, are essential for staying competitive in the telecommunications industry, which is rapidly evolving with new technologies and consumer demands. Telecommunications Industry Expert VEON's capex intensity of 17.6% aligns with industry norms for telecom operators investing in infrastructure and digital transformation. The projected capex intensity for 2024 of 18-19% indicates ongoing investment, which is critical for maintaining network quality and supporting the rollout of new services. However, it is essential to balance this with the need to manage debt levels and generate positive cash flow.VEON's appointment of PwC as its auditor for 2023 is a standard practice that ensures financial transparency and compliance. The BB- credit ratings by S&P Global and Fitch are below investment grade, reflecting a degree of financial risk; however, the improved leverage ratio could positively influence future ratings. Investors should keep an eye on VEON's ability to maintain financial discipline while fostering growth in its digital verticals. 03/21/2024 - 02:00 AM VEON 4Q23 trading update: Strong organic growth in revenue and EBITDA, solid execution of VEON 2.0 strategy Amsterdam, 21 March 2024 07:00AM CET – VEON Q4 and FY 2023 Highlights Q4 revenue of USD 953 million, +1.4% YoY (+17.9% YoY in local currency normalised) and EBITDA of USD 364 million, -20.4% YoY (+24.9% YoY in local currency normalised) FY revenue of USD 3,698 million, -1.5% YoY (+17.9% YoY in local currency normalised) and EBITDA of USD 1,609 million, -7.9% (+24.9% YoY in local currency normalised)Q4 capex of USD 258 million, -1.8% YoY, with LTM capex intensity of 17.6% and FY capex of USD 651 million, -21.8% YoY, with LTM capex intensity of 17.6%Total cash and cash equivalents of USD 1.7 billion, with USD 1.3 billion at HQ and gross debt at USD 4.7 billion (decreased by USD 2.8 billion YoY), with net debt excluding lease liabilities at USD 2.0 billion (decreased by USD 1.7 billion YoY)Appoints PwC as 2023 auditor Credit ratings of BB- assigned by S&P Global and FitchFY 2024 revenue growth guidance in local currency of 16-18%, EBITDA growth guidance in local currency of 18-20%, and capex intensity of 18-19% VEON Ltd.

The acquisition aims to accelerate roadmaps, improve market assessments, and introduce new Business Development & Licensing Enterprise Workbench. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of MotionHall by Clarivate Plc represents a strategic move to intensify its footprint in the life sciences and healthcare sectors through the integration of advanced artificial intelligence technologies. This move is indicative of a broader trend within the industry where companies are increasingly seeking to leverage AI to gain a competitive edge in market intelligence and operational efficiency.The benefits of such an acquisition are multi-fold. For one, the integration of MotionHall's assets can potentially streamline Clarivate's product offerings, notably the Cortellis suite, by improving search functionalities and expanding data quality. This can lead to enhanced decision-making capabilities for Clarivate's clients. Furthermore, the assimilation of MotionHall's client base and their team's expertise could expedite Clarivate's roadmap in business development and licensing, an area that is critical for growth in the life sciences sector.However, there are potential challenges that should not be overlooked. The assimilation of new technologies and teams often comes with integration risks, including cultural fit, technology compatibility and the potential for disruption to existing services. Investors should monitor the post-acquisition integration closely to ensure that the anticipated synergies are realized without significant setbacks. Financial Analyst Clarivate Plc's acquisition of MotionHall's assets is a strategic investment that could have tangible impacts on the company's financial performance. By bolstering its AI capabilities, Clarivate aims to enhance its product suite, which could lead to an increase in customer acquisition and retention, as well as potential upselling opportunities.From a financial perspective, the key metrics to watch in the aftermath of this acquisition will be Clarivate's revenue growth, particularly within its Life Sciences & Healthcare segment and its R&D expenditure as the company integrates MotionHall's AI technology. Investors should also be alert to the acquisition's effect on Clarivate's operating margins, as initial integration costs may offset efficiency gains in the short term.Long-term, the success of this acquisition will be measured by Clarivate's ability to convert enhanced AI capabilities into market leadership and increased market share, which would ultimately drive shareholder value. As with any acquisition, there is a risk of overestimating the synergies or encountering unforeseen costs, which could impact expected financial outcomes. 03/21/2024 - 04:00 AM Acquisition of MotionHall reinforces strategy to lead market-specific solutions, including workflows and expert services fuelled by industry vertical AI LONDON, March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Clarivate Plc (NYSE:CLVT) a leading global provider of transformative intelligence, has announced an agreement to acquire the substantial majority of assets of MotionHall, a Silicon Valley technology start-up company serving the life sciences with industry vertical artificial intelligence (AI) solutions.

With continued advancements on the OCP oil export pilot through Ecuador, the Company will continue to prioritize derisking oil sales so PetroTal can embark on new production growth projects.With its strong, debt free, balance sheet, PetroTal will continue to evaluate accretive growth opportunities. I would like to thank shareholders for their continued support, as well as PetroTal's board of directors and the rest of the PetroTal team for their continued valuable contributions to our success.""

Financial and Operating Updates Subsequent to December 31, 2023Robust oil production. Production continues to trend ahead of 2024 guidance with the Company producing 20,453 bopd in January and 17,411 bopd in February 2024. March production to date has averaged 15,600 bopd with the Company's most recently drilled well (16H) producing around 2,500 bopd and nearing full investment payout. The field was shut down from March 6, 2024 until March 8, 2024 as a safety precaution after an independently operated barging incident caused a small release of oil into the Puniuaha river approximately 2km away from the field. No injuries were reported and the cleanup has been substantially completed. The field downtime did not materially impact Q1 2024 production and the Company is still expected to meet Q1 2024 production guidance of 18,500 bopd. Well 17H update. The Company has completed drilling well 17H on time, materially on its $14 million budget, and commenced production on March 1, 2024. The well has a total depth of approximately 4,960 meters with a lateral section of 1,245 meters. Production since start up has averaged 3,300 bopd under natural flow conditions allowing the well continuing to clean out drilling fluids and reach maximum initial production.Well 18H drilling commencement. The Company commenced drilling well 18H on March 5, 2024 with an estimated cost of $14 million. The well is expected to take approximately 60 days to drill and complete with initial production estimated to occur by mid May 2024. OCP pilot project. PetroTal is pleased to announce continued advancement on the OCP pilot oil shipment with the signing of three key approvals. In early February 2024, the Company received approval letters from the Ecuadorian Ministry of Environment and Ecuadorian Navy along with the successful signing of a use of port agreement with Petroecuador. The Company is awaiting on a final letter from the Port Subsecretariate to start the 100,000 bbl pilot. Pending success of the first pilot, the Company anticipates an additional pilot in the second half of 2024 with recurring sales expected in Q4 2024.2024 Budget guidance. On January 22, 2024, the Company released its 2024 guidance, forecasting an average 2024 production and sales target of 17,000 bopd, delivering an estimated 20% growth rate over 2023 average production. If this forecast is acheived, PetroTal will generate approximately $200 million in EBITDA underpinned by a total 2024 capex spend of $134 million and allowing for a stable return of capital program. Should production and/or Brent price outperform the Company's base case budget assumptions (Brent oil at $77/bbl), liquidity sweep for shareholder return upside is possible. At March 15, 2024, the Company estimates it is trending in line with budget expectations.2023 year ended reserves. On February 12, 2024, PetroTal announced its updated reserves profile ending December 31, 2023. The Company was able grow its 2P after tax per share reserves value to $1.80/share with a $1.64 billion after tax net present value of reserves, discounted at 10% (""NPV10"") and associated 2P reserves of 100 million bbls.

Such statements relate to possible future events, including, but not limited to, oil production levels and guidance. All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by the use of words such as ""anticipate"", ""believe"", ""expect"", ""plan"", ""estimate"", ""potential"", ""will"", ""should"", ""continue"", ""may"", ""objective"" and similar expressions. Without limitation, this press release contains forward-looking statements pertaining to: PetroTal's drilling, completions, workovers and other activities; the Company's plans and expectations with respect to the OCP pilot oil shipment and its continued advancement; anticipated future production and revenue; drilling plans including the timing of drilling, commissioning, and startup; PetroTal's 2024 guidance, including in respect of its production and sales target of 17,000 bopd and estimate that it will deliver a 20% growth rate over 2023 production and anticipated benefits thereof (i.e., that PetroTal will generate approximately $200 million in EBITDA as a result, underpinned by a total 2024 capex spend of $134 million and allowing for a stable return of capital program and shareholder return upside); expectations with respect to well 17H production; 2024 budget guidance; plans with respect to well 18H including in respect of anticipated costs, completion and timing thereof including the Company's plans to begin production at well 18H in May of 2024; the Company's expectation to meet Q1 2024 production guidance of 18,500 bopd; expectation that the Company will continue to prioritize derisking oil sales so it can embark on new production growth projects; average 2024 production; intentions with respect to return of capital and the 19 year 2P reserve life index. In addition, statements relating to expected production, reserves, recovery, replacement, costs and valuation are deemed to be forward-looking statements as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions that the reserves described can be profitably produced in the future. The forward-looking statements are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by the Company, including, but not limited to, expectations and assumptions concerning the ability of existing infrastructure to deliver production and the anticipated capital expenditures associated therewith, the ability to obtain and maintain necessary permits and licenses, the ability of government groups to effectively achieve objectives in respect of reducing social conflict and collaborating towards continued investment in the energy sector, reservoir characteristics, recovery factor, exploration upside, prevailing commodity prices and the actual prices received for PetroTal's products, including pursuant to hedging arrangements, the availability and performance of drilling rigs, facilities, pipelines, other oilfield services and skilled labour, royalty regimes and exchange rates, the impact of inflation on costs, the application of regulatory and licensing requirements, the accuracy of PetroTal's geological interpretation of its drilling and land opportunities, current legislation, receipt of required regulatory approval, the success of future drilling and development activities, the performance of new wells, future river water levels, the Company's growth strategy, general economic conditions and availability of required equipment and services. Although the Company believes that the expectations and assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because the Company can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to, risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general (e.g., operational risks in development, exploration and production; delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures; the uncertainty of reserve estimates; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production, costs and expenses; and health, safety and environmental risks), commodity price volatility, price differentials and the actual prices received for products, exchange rate fluctuations, legal, political and economic instability in Peru, access to transportation routes and markets for the Company's production, changes in legislation affecting the oil and gas industry and uncertainties resulting from potential delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures; changes in the financial landscape both domestically and abroad, including volatility in the stock market and financial system; and wars (including Russia's war in Ukraine and the Israeli-Hamas conflict). Please refer to the risk factors identified in the Company's most recent annual information form and MD&A which are available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are made as of the date hereof and the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements or information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless so required by applicable securities laws.OIL REFERENCES: All references to ""oil"" or ""crude oil"" production, revenue or sales in this press release mean ""heavy crude oil"" as defined in NI 51-101. All references to Brent indicate Intercontinental Exchange (""ICE"") Brent. Recovery factor percentages include historical production.RESERVES DISCLOSURE: All reserves values, future net revenue and ancillary information contained in this press release are derived from from an independent reserves report prepared by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (""NSAI"") effective December 31, 2023 unless otherwise noted. Estimates of reserves and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same level of confidence as estimates of reserves and future net revenue for all properties, due to the effect of aggregation. There is no assurance that the forecast price and cost assumptions applied by NSAI in evaluating PetroTal's reserves will be attained and variances could be material. It should not be assumed that the estimates of future net revenues presented in the tables below represent the fair market value of the reserves. The recovery and reserve estimates of PetroTal's oil reserves provided herein are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered. Actual oil reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil, reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves. The reserve and associated cash flow information set forth herein are estimates only. Proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves. Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves. Proved developed producing reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals open at the time of the estimate. These reserves may be currently producing or, if shut-in, they must have previously been on production, and the date of resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainty. Possible reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure (e.g., when compared to the cost of drilling a well) is required to render them capable of production. They must fully meet the requirements of the reserves category (proved, probable, possible) to which they are assigned. Certain terms used in this press release but not defined are defined in NI 51-101, CSA Staff Notice 51-324 - Revised Glossary to NI 51-101, Revised Glossary to NI 51-101, Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (""CSA Staff Notice 51-324"") and/or the COGEH and, unless the context otherwise requires, shall have the same meanings herein as in NI 51-101, CSA Staff Notice 51-324 and the COGEH, as the case may be.SHORT TERM RESULTS: References in this press release to peak rates, production rates since inception, current production rates, initial seven day production rates and other short-term production rates are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons, however such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will commence production and decline thereafter and are not indicative of long-term performance or of ultimate recovery. While encouraging, readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in calculating the aggregate production of PetroTal. The Company cautions that such results should be considered to be preliminary.SPECIFIED FINANCIAL MEASURES: This press release includes various specified financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP financial ratios and capital management measures as further described herein. These measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") and, therefore, may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures by other companies. Management uses these non- GAAP measures for its own performance measurement and to provide shareholders and investors with additional measurements of the Company's efficiency and its ability to fund a portion of its future capital expenditures. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" (non-GAAP financial measure) is calculated as consolidated net income (loss) before interest and financing expenses, income taxes, depletion, depreciation and amortization and adjusted for G&A impacts and certain non-cash, extraordinary and non-recurring items primarily relating to unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments and impairment losses, including derivative true-up settlements. PetroTal utilizes adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operational performance and cash flow generating capability. Adjusted EBITDA impacts the level and extent of funding for capital projects investments. Reference to EBITDA is calculated as net operating income less G&A. ""Net Operating Income"" (non-GAAP financial measure) is calculated as revenues less royalties, operating expenses, and direct transportation. The Company considers Net Operating Income measure as they demonstrate Company's profitability relative to current commodity prices. ""Net surplus (debt)"" (non-GAAP financial measure) is calculated by adding together total cash, trade and VAT receivables, and short and long-term net derivative balances less total current liabilities, long-term debt, non-current lease liabilities, deferred tax, and other long-term obligations. Net surplus (debt) is used by management to provide a more complete understanding of the Company's capital structure and provides a key measure to assess the Company's liquidity. ""Free funds flow"" (non-GAAP financial measure) is calculated as net operating income less G&A less exploration and development capital expenditures less realized derivative gains/losses and is calculated prior to all debt service, taxes, lease payments, hedge costs, factoring, and lease payments. Management uses free funds flow to determine the amount of funds available to the Company for future capital allocation decisions. Please refer to the MD&A for additional information relating to specified financial measures. ""Free cash flow"" (non-GAAP financial measure) is calculated as EBITDA less G&A less Capex prior to the realization of any derivative impacts.OIL AND GAS MEASURES: This press release contains metrics commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry which have been prepared by management, such as ""reserves life index"", ""reserves replacement"" and ""per share reserves value"". These terms do not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, and therefore should not be used to make such comparisons. ""Reserve life index"" is calculated as total Company interest reserves divided by annual production. ""Reserves replacement"" is calculated as reserves in the referenced category divided by estimated referenced production. ""Reserves per share"" or ""per share reserves value"" is calculated as reserves in the referenced category divided by the number of shares of PetroTal's common stock issued and outstanding. These terms have been calculated by management and do not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, and therefore should not be used to make such comparisons. Management uses these oil and gas metrics for its own performance measurements and to provide shareholders with measures to compare PetroTal's operations over time. Readers are cautioned that the information provided by these metrics, or that can be derived from the metrics presented in this press release, should not be relied upon for investment or other purposes.FOFI DISCLOSURE: This press release contains future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information (collectively, ""FOFI"") about PetroTal's prospective results of operations and production results, free funds flow, cost estimates, NPV10, tax rates, budget, EBITDA, 2024 capex, 2024 average production and production and sales targets, balance sheet strength, shareholder returns and components thereof, all of which are subject to the same assumptions, risk factors, limitations and qualifications as set forth in the above paragraphs.

Negative None. 03/21/2024 - 03:01 AM Drill Program Suspended Due to Early Ice Road ClosureCALGARY, Alberta, March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Traction Uranium Corp. (CSE: TRAC) (OTC: TRCTF) (FRA: Z1K) (the “Company” or “Traction”) announces the completion of a single sonic drill hole at the Hearty Bay Property (“The Property”) and the early suspension of the drill program due to deteriorating ice conditions on Lake Athabasca. The use of a track mounted sonic drill has resulted in the recovery of till for the first time under the lake in the up-ice direction from the high grade boulder trains on Isle Brochet and resulted in the recovery of a complete intersect of the underlying glacial till. Initial interpretation of this unit is favorable and suggests less post depositional disturbance than assumed, supporting the theory that the glacial till in which the historic high grade boulder trains on Isle Brochet occur, does extend up ice under the lake towards a source location. Importantly, this suggests that it will be possible to use the subglacial till sampling method to trace the dispersion of uraniferous till under the lake, and thus directly back to the source of the historic Isle Brochet high grade boulder trains. The two previous sub glacial till programs completed by the geomorphological experts at Palmer Environmental Consulting in 2023 demonstrated a uranium geochemistry signature in the sub glacial till, a reliable sampling medium invulnerable to the effects of wave action, below the historic high grade boulder trains located on surface on Isle Brochet. The discovery of this 2.3 m thick till under the lake provides strong support for additional sub glacial till sampling to ultimately lead directly to the source from which the radioactive boulder trains on Isle Brochet originate. Traction and F3 Uranium Corp. (“F3”) have also engaged Convolutions Geoscience to complete a constrained inversion of the ground gravity data collected in January and the ground VLF EM data collected in 2022. An inversion based structural interpretation will then be included for drill planning for the next program on the Property.

The information provides an indication of the exploration potential of the Company’s properties but may not be representative of expected results. About Hearty Bay: The Hearty Bay property consists of 7 contiguous mineral claims with an area of 11,173 ha. and is located on the north edge of the Athabasca Basin, 20 km west of the Fond-du-Lac uranium deposit and 60 km east of the Beaver Lodge uranium district. The property surrounds the historic Isle Brochet high grade boulder field, consisting of the Wolfe and Jackfish 1km long dispersal trains trending in a down-ice direction and containing reported historic assay values up to 3.54% U3O8. Approximately 600m to the northeast on the lake bottom a group of radioactive boulders were discovered reported to contain up to 1.4% U3O8. These boulders were both sandstone and altered basement rocks which forms the basis of the source to occur at or near the unconformity. The source of the boulders remains undetermined.

The loan, with a term of five years, involves multiple lenders and confirms international financial sector support. The company complied with all required procedures to obtain the loan, with terms reviewed and authorized by the MHCP.

Ecopetrol, a major energy company in Colombia and the Americas, has diverse operations in hydrocarbon production, transportation, logistics, refining, petrochemicals, gas distribution, energy transmission, and exploration in various countries. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent announcement by Ecopetrol S.A. regarding a new loan of up to USD 1,200 million is a significant financial move, reflecting the company's ongoing debt management strategy. The involvement of prominent international banks in the loan agreement underscores the financial sector's confidence in Ecopetrol's creditworthiness and strategic direction. This refinancing effort may be seen as a proactive measure to streamline the company's debt profile, which could lead to a more favorable interest rate environment for Ecopetrol, potentially reducing interest expenses over the term of the loan.Investors should note the five-year term and the variable interest rate, which indicates exposure to interest rate fluctuations that could affect future financial commitments. The principal's repayment at maturity suggests that Ecopetrol is betting on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows to cover the lump sum payment. This strategy can be effective in managing short-term liquidity but requires careful monitoring of the company's cash flow forecasts and the broader economic context that could affect its revenue streams, particularly as it is heavily involved in the hydrocarbon sector, which is sensitive to global market dynamics. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the loan agreement's adherence to the law of the State of New York is a strategic choice, given New York's status as a global financial hub with a well-established legal framework for such transactions. The inclusion of standard events of default clauses provides a safety net for the lenders, ensuring that they have the right to demand early repayment if Ecopetrol fails to meet its obligations. This level of detail in the agreement highlights the thoroughness of the legal due diligence process and the robustness of the contractual protections in place.For stakeholders, the regulatory oversight by the Colombian Ministry of Finance and Public Credit is a reassuring signal, as it implies a level of governmental support and scrutiny. The authorization of the loan by the MHCP also suggests that this financial maneuver aligns with broader economic policies and objectives within Colombia, which may have implications for the company's strategic positioning within the country's energy sector. Market Research Analyst Looking at the broader industry context, Ecopetrol's significant role in the American continent's energy sector, with its diverse portfolio spanning hydrocarbon production, energy transmission and even road concessions, positions the company as a key player in the region. The loan could facilitate further growth and consolidation of its market position, especially in light of its recent acquisition of a majority stake in ISA. This move into energy transmission and related sectors indicates a strategic diversification that can mitigate risks associated with the volatile oil and gas markets.Market trends show an increasing focus on integrated energy companies developing a more resilient and diversified business model. Ecopetrol's strategy, supported by this loan, seems to align with these trends. However, the success of this approach will depend on the company's execution of its investment plans and its ability to manage the complexities of an expanded operational scope while maintaining financial stability. 03/20/2024 - 10:51 PM BOGOTA, Colombia, March 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ecopetrol S.A. (BVC: ECOPETROL; NYSE: EC) informs that, as part of its comprehensive debt management and maturity refinancing strategy, the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (""MHCP""), through Resolution 0652 of 20 March 2024, has approved the execution of a loan of up to USD 1,200 million. The loan will be executed by and among Ecopetrol, as borrower, and Bank of Nova Scotia (USD 300 million), BBVA Securities Inc. (USD 250 million), Bank of America, N.A. (USD 200 million), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (USD 200 million), Itaú Chile New York Branch (USD 100 million) and Standard Chartered Bank Hong Kong Limited (USD 150 million), as lenders. The term of the loan will be five (5) years; principal will be repaid at maturity; and interest will be subject to a variable rate previously agreed by the parties. The loan was approved by the MHCP, given Ecopetrol's request to refinance the USD 1,200 million outstanding under a previously-executed loan authorized by Resolution 1824 of July 30, 2021, and which expired on August 16, 2023. Such loan authorized in 2021 was disbursed on September 29, 2022 to refinance the debt contracted for the acquisition of Interconexión Eléctrica S.A. In order to obtain the loan, the Company complied with all the required internal and external procedures and approvals. The terms of the loan confirm the support and confidence of the international financial sector in the strategy of the Ecopetrol Group. Pursuant to Colombian regulation, the MHCP reviewed and authorized the terms of the agreement, which provide for events of default by the borrower, such as failure to make timely payments of principal and interest, possible impairment of the borrower's ability to pay, impairment of the integrity of the borrower's financial information, and failure to comply with contractual obligations, among others, which are frequently used in transactions of this nature. Should any of these events materialize, lenders would be entitled to claim early repayment of the debt, according to the procedure foreseen in the contract. Likewise, the loan agreement establishes Ecopetrol's right of recourse against the lenders when they fail to make disbursements under the terms of the loan. All of the above, in accordance with the law of the State of New York, which is the governing law of the agreement. Ecopetrol is the largest company in Colombia and one of the main integrated energy companies in the American continent with more than 18,000 employees. In Colombia, it is responsible for more than 60% of the hydrocarbon production of most transportation, logistics, and hydrocarbon refining systems, and it holds leading positions in the petrochemicals and gas distribution segments. With the acquisition of 51.4% of ISA's shares, the company participates in energy transmission, the management of real-time systems (XM), and the Barranquilla - Cartagena coastal highway concession. At the international level, Ecopetrol has a stake in strategic basins in the American continent, with Drilling and Exploration operations in the United States (Permian basin and the Gulf of Mexico), Brazil, and Mexico, and, through ISA and its subsidiaries, Ecopetrol holds leading positions in the power transmission business in Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Bolivia, road concessions in Chile, and the telecommunications sector.

The company's commitment to debt repayment, shareholder returns, and value generation underpins its long-term sustainability and growth prospects. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The report from Greenfire Resources Ltd. details several key financial and operational metrics that are vital for understanding the company's performance and future outlook. The company's bitumen production levels are noteworthy, as they reflect the effectiveness of its Refill drilling program and facility optimizations. This production data is essential for gauging Greenfire's operational efficiency and its ability to capitalize on its assets in the Athabasca region.Furthermore, the Adjusted EBITDA and funds flow provide insight into the company's profitability and cash generation capabilities. A significant decline in these figures year-over-year could signal operational challenges or market pressures affecting the company's financial health. The capital expenditures and liquidity information also offer a view of the company's investment in growth and its financial resilience, respectively.Lastly, the discussion of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project (TMX) and its potential impact on the Canadian heavy oil barrel provides a strategic angle, as successful completion could enhance market access and improve pricing for Greenfire's production. This aspect is particularly relevant given the company's production is tied to WCS differentials, which could see a positive shift with the TMX's operation. Financial Analyst The disclosed financial results, including a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA and funds flow from the previous year, raise questions about the company's revenue and cost management strategies. The net loss reported for the year could be indicative of broader industry trends or company-specific operational issues. Investors will be interested in understanding the drivers behind these numbers, such as commodity price fluctuations or operational inefficiencies.Greenfire's debt repayment strategy, which commits 75% of excess cash flow to redeeming the 2028 Notes, is a prudent approach to strengthening the balance sheet. The focus on debt reduction is a positive sign for investor confidence, as it suggests a commitment to financial stability and future solvency.Analyzing the reserves evaluations and their net present value provides a long-term perspective on the company's assets and potential future revenue streams. The large 2P reserves life index suggests a robust reserve base that could support extended production and revenue generation, which is a significant factor for long-term investors. Market Research Analyst Greenfire's operational update and forward-looking statements regarding its Refill drilling program and production growth strategies are key indicators of the company's ambition to scale operations. The industry's response to these initiatives, particularly in the context of the oil sands market, will influence the company's market positioning and competitive edge.The potential re-rating of the Canadian heavy oil barrel, in light of the TMX, could have a considerable impact on the company's revenue streams. Market dynamics such as the WCS differential play a important role in the profitability of companies like Greenfire, which rely on heavy oil production. As such, any shift in this differential is likely to affect the company's financial performance.Moreover, the company's commitment to capital return policies and evaluation of additional growth opportunities, including acquisitions, signals a proactive approach to shareholder value creation. This strategic direction will be closely monitored by the market, as it could significantly influence the company's stock performance and attractiveness to investors. 03/20/2024 - 10:09 PM Calgary, Alberta--(Newsfile Corp. - March 20, 2024) - Greenfire Resources Ltd.

Outlook and Q1 2024 Operational UpdateGreenfire successfully completed the ten well extended reach Refill drilling program at the Expansion Asset in February of 2024 and subsequently initiated the seven well extended reach Refill drilling program at the Demo Asset.In the first two months of 2024, consolidated bitumen production increased to average approximately 20,000 bbls/d, reflecting initial production contributions from new extended reach Refill wells and continued increases in reservoir pressure following heightened rates of non-condensable gas (""NCG"") co-injection at the Expansion Asset.Greenfire's previously announced 2024 Outlook allocates capital expenditures to the Hangingstone Facilities, which at the mid-point, includes $55 million directed to drilling for the development of the Company's capital efficient and productive inventory of Refill well targets, along with $25 million for facilities and field infrastructure investments.Greenfire remains committed to prioritizing debt repayment and intends to reduce debt in the near-term using 75% of excess cash flow (as defined in the indenture for the Company's Senior Secured Notes due 2028, the ""2028 Notes"") to semi-annually redeem the 2028 Notes until total indebtedness is less than US$150 million.The outstanding principal amount of the 2028 Notes is US$300 million or $397 million assuming the year-end 2023 U.S. to Canadian dollar exchange rate of 1.32.The Company is positioned to benefit from completion of TMX, given 100% of its production is weighted to crude oil benchmarks that are linked to Western Canadian Select (""WCS"") differentials, which could improve as an incremental 590,000 bbls/d of pipeline egress to tidewater is expected to become operational for Western Canada in 2024.At the mid-point of Greenfire's 2024 Outlook production range and assuming a US$15/bbl differential, the Company estimates that each US$1/bbl change in the WCS differential would impact 2024 adjusted EBITDA by approximately $15 million.Expansion Asset (75% Working Interest, Operator)Initial Ten Refill Well Drilling Program Successfully Completed: Eight extended reach Refill wells were drilled at the Expansion Asset during 2023, with an additional two extended reach Refill wells drilled during the first quarter of 2024.Heightened NCG Co-injection Continues to Support Higher Reservoir Pressure: Greenfire successfully executed multiple NCG debottlenecking initiatives at the Expansion Asset in the second half of 2023, which have enabled the Company to deliver NCG at higher and more consistent rates for reservoir co-injection. With heightened rates sustained, the Company expects that higher reservoir pressure will be restored at the Expansion Asset around mid-2024, which management anticipates will support increased production rates.Greenfire's working interest bitumen production at the Expansion Asset averaged approximately 17,650 bbls/d during the first two months of 2024. The Company has recently encountered third-party downhole temperature sensor failures in five of the recently drilled Refill wells at the Expansion Asset. Greenfire has completed the first sensor replacement in March 2024 and plans to replace the remaining sensors in the second quarter of 2024. The Company estimates that working interest bitumen production has been impacted by approximately 2,000 bbls/d.Demo Asset (100% Working Interest, Operator)Refill Drilling Program Launched: Seven extended reach Refill wells with lateral lengths averaging approximately 2,000 meters are in the process of being drilled.To accommodate the Refill well drilling activities, producing wells across multiple adjacent pads are expected to temporarily operate at reduced productivity. Greenfire expects to complete the seven Refill well program by the second quarter of 2024.One extended reach Refill well has been successfully drilled to date, representing the first Refill (or infill) well drilled at the site since the Demo Asset was commissioned for SAGD in 1999.Disposal Well Expected to Recommence Operations: The disposal well at the Demo Asset has been temporarily shut-in since the beginning of October 2023. Remediation work for this well is now complete, with disposal operations anticipated to recommence upon regulatory approval, which is projected to increase bitumen production by an incremental approximately 1,000 bbls/d once fully operational.Greenfire's working interest bitumen production at the Demo Asset averaged approximately 2,300 bbls/d during the first two months of 2024, mainly due to production impacts from ongoing Refill well drilling operations as well as the temporarily shut-in of the disposal well.Greenfire's Growth-oriented Strategy Underpinned by Concentrated Tier-1 SAGD AssetsGreenfire has a large, long-life and relatively low decline Tier-1 oil sands resource base, with two producing and adjacent SAGD assets at the Hangingstone Facilities and expandable pipeline infrastructure in place for diluted bitumen and diluent at the Expansion Asset. The Company's structural cost advantages from its Tier-1 SAGD reservoir at the Hangingstone Facilities, combined with its relatively lower forecasted capital expenditure profile due to its projected multi-year inventory of Refill well targets, is anticipated to result in continued near-term production growth and potential meaningful free cash flow generation. The Company believes that the Hangingstone Facilities offer ample opportunities for additional value generation.In addition to Greenfire's existing commitment to repay debt, the Company intends to formalize and initiate a policy to return capital to its shareholders over time. Greenfire also plans to evaluate and consider additional potential prospects for further production growth, including external acquisitions that compete with the expected returns from its existing Tier-1 SAGD assets, if the Company believes they are accretive to Greenfire's shareholders.Year-end 2023 Independent Reserves Reinforce Value Potential at the Hangingstone FacilitiesGreenfire's independent reserves evaluator, McDaniel & Associates Consultants Ltd. (""McDaniel""), prepared independent reserves evaluations for Greenfire in accordance with NI 51-101 standards, effective December 31, 2023. In accordance with NI 51-101 standards using an average of McDaniel, Sproule and GLJ forecast pricing as at January 1, 2024, Greenfire holds approximately 238 million barrels of bitumen 2P reserves with an NPV10 of $2.4 billion or approximately $29.70 per diluted share, net of outstanding debt plus cash and cash equivalents, entirely underpinned by the Tier-1 SAGD reservoir at the Hangingstone Facilities.December 31, 2023 NI 51-101 Reserves at Forecast Pricing: Reserves(mbbls)(1)NPV10 Before Tax($ Million)(1)(2) Proved Developed Producing 30,886$746Total Proved183,282$2,023Total Proved and Probable237,679$2,423 (1) Reserves and the associated values have been reported on a ""gross"" basis under NI 51-101, which reflects Greenfire's working interest reserves before deduction of royalties.

Operating NetbackOil sales is the most directly comparable GAAP measure for operating netback, which is a non-GAAP measure. This measure is not intended to represent oil sales, net earnings or other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with IFRS. Operating netback is comprised of oil sales, less diluent expense, royalties, operating expense, transportation and marketing expense, adjusted for realized commodity risk management gains or losses, as appropriate. Operating netback is a financial measure widely used in the oil and gas industry as a supplemental measure of a Company's efficiency and ability to generate cash flow for debt repayments, capital expenditures or other uses.The following table is a reconciliation of oil sales to operating netback.Operating Netback(1)Three months endedDecember 31,Year endedDecember 31, ($ thousands, unless otherwise noted)20232022202320222021(2) Oil sales161,730180,741675,970998,849270,674Diluent expense(76,768)(85,946)(304,740)(368,015)(94,623)Transportation and marketing(13,277)(16,566)(55,673)(67,842)(24,057)Royalties(6,024)(7,477)(23,706)(50,064)(9,543)Operating expense - energy(12,223)(22,100)(56,624)(85,232)(28,674)Operating expense - non-energy(22,862)(20,329)(92,342)(75,594)(31,037)Operating netback(1), excluding realized gain (loss) risk management contracts30,57628,324142,885352,10282,741Realized gain (loss) risk management contracts(3,225)6,243(10,182)(122,408)(3,614)Operating netback(1)27,35134,567132,703229,69479,127 Oil sales ($/bbl)71.0472.1873.9196.8271.89Diluent expense ($/bbl)(17.65)(19.34)(16.39)(12.83)(10.92)Transportation and marketing ($/bbl)(8.34)(9.23)(8.63)(9.03)(8.33)Royalties ($/bbl)(3.79)(4.17)(3.67)(6.67)(3.30)Operating expense - energy ($/bbl)(7.68)(12.32)(8.77)(11.35)(9.93)Operating expense - non-energy ($/bbl)(14.37)(11.33)(14.31)(10.06)(10.75)Operating netback(1), excluding realized gain (loss) risk management contracts ($/bbl)19.2115.7922.1446.8828.65Realized gain (loss) risk management contracts ($/bbl)(2.03)3.48(1.58)(16.30)(1.25)Operating netback ($/bbl)(1)17.1919.2720.5630.5827.40 (1) Non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures presented by other entities.

Adjusted Funds Flow and Adjusted Free Cash FlowCash provided (used) by operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted funds flow and adjusted free cash flow, which are non-GAAP measures. These measures are not intended to represent cash provided (used) by operating activities calculated in accordance with IFRS. The adjusted funds flow measure allows management and others to evaluate the Company's ability to fund its capital programs and meet its ongoing financial obligations using cash flow internally generated from ongoing operating related activities. We compute adjusted funds flow as cash provided (used) by operating activities, excluding the impact of changes in non-cash working capital, less transaction costs.Management uses adjusted free cash flow as an indicator of the efficiency and liquidity of its business, measuring its funds after capital investment that is available to manage debt levels and return capital to shareholders. By removing the impact of current period capital expenditures from adjusted free cash flow, management monitors its adjusted free cash flow to inform its capital allocation decisions. We compute adjusted free cash flow as cash provided (used) by operating activities, excluding the impact of changes in non-cash working capital, less transaction costs and capital expenditures.The following table is a reconciliation of cash provided (used) by operating activities to adjusted funds flow and adjusted free cashflow.Adjusted Funds Flow(1) and Adjusted Free Cash Flow(1) Three months endedDecember 31, Year endedDecember 31, ($ thousands)20232022202320222021(2) Cash provided (used) by operating activities25,53017,32286,548164,72731,985Transaction costs3,8482,76912,1722,76910,318Changes in non-cash working capital(18,861)(3,189)(25,514)(3,570)6,910 Adjusted funds flow(1)10,51716,90273,206163,92649,213 Capital expenditures(19,413)(12,361)(33,428)(39,592)(4,594)Adjusted free cash flow(1)(8,896)4,54139,778124,33444,619 (1) Non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures presented by other entities.

Oil and Gas TermsThis press release uses the term Tier-1 SAGD reservoir to describe the bitumen reservoirs that Greenfire has an interest in. The term Tier-1 SAGD reservoir refers to SAGD reservoirs that have no top gas, bottom water, or lean zones, commonly referred to as ""thief zones"". Thief zones provide an unwanted outlet for steam and reservoir pressure. Thief zones require costly downhole pumps and recurring pump replacements to achieve targeted production rates, leading to higher capital and operating expenditures. Tier-1 wells flow to surface with natural lift; not requiring downhole pumps or gas lift.Contact InformationGreenfire Resources Ltd.205 5th Avenue SWSuite 1900Calgary, AB T2P 2V7 investors@greenfireres.comgreenfireres.comTo view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/202535 What were Greenfire Resources 's Q4 2023 consolidated bitumen production and adjusted EBITDA?

Completion of a $2.8 million public offering of common stock and warrants to increase institutional ownership and improve stock trading volumes. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in revenue for Hall of Fame Resort & Entertainment Company is a positive sign, indicating that the company's strategic focus on events and rentals is yielding financial benefits. The 101% growth in fourth quarter revenue and 51% increase for the full year suggest that the company is effectively capitalizing on its unique positioning in the sports and entertainment industry. However, the widening net loss year-over-year, driven by impairment expenses and increased net interest and operating expenses, raises concerns about the company's current profitability and cost management strategies.From an investment perspective, the substantial net loss despite growing revenues may signal underlying challenges in achieving profitability. The cash balance, including a significant portion of restricted cash, remains relatively unchanged quarter over quarter, which could indicate a tight liquidity position. The completion of a public offering to increase institutional ownership and improve stock trading volumes reflects an active approach to capital management, but it also suggests a need for external financing to support ongoing operations and development phases. Market Research Analyst The emphasis on a synergistic business model and the creation of integrated guest experiences is a strategic move that aligns with current industry trends towards experiential offerings. The partnership with high-profile entities like Coca-Cola Consolidated and the Ohio Lottery, as well as the expansion of youth sports programming, are likely to enhance the company's brand and attract a broader audience. These strategic partnerships and the development of media projects could diversify revenue streams and strengthen the company's market position over time.Looking at the industry as a whole, the focus on media and gaming products, as well as the development of Hall of Fame Village, suggests an understanding of the evolving landscape of entertainment and sports. The company's efforts to pivot towards these growth areas could pay off in the long term, as consumer preferences continue to shift towards immersive and interactive experiences. However, the short-term financials present a mixed picture, with impressive revenue growth overshadowed by significant losses. Hospitality Industry Expert The reported increase in hotel revenue at the Doubletree by Hilton Downtown Canton indicates that the company's hospitality segment is contributing positively to the overall revenue growth. This aligns with broader hospitality industry trends, where strategic location and themed experiences can drive occupancy rates and pricing power. The Hall of Fame Village's ability to host large events, such as those with a comedian of Bill Burr's caliber, demonstrates its potential as a destination for diverse entertainment offerings.The focus on completing the Phase II development of Hall of Fame Village points to a long-term vision for creating a comprehensive and differentiated guest experience. However, the success of such developments hinges on sustained visitor interest and the ability to manage operational costs effectively. The balance between investing in expansion and managing the existing operational costs will be critical for the company's long-term financial stability and growth within the hospitality and entertainment sector. 03/20/2024 - 04:30 PM CANTON, Ohio, March 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Hall of Fame Resort & Entertainment Company (NASDAQ: HOFV, HOFVW) (the ""Company""), the only resort, entertainment and media company centered around the power of professional football, announced its fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2023 results for the period ended December 31, 2023.

Positive Positive financial performance with net sales of $316.8 million and net earnings of $22.0 million for the fiscal 2024 third quarter. Completion of the separation of Worthington Steel into an independent company. Adjusted earnings of $0.80 per share, reflecting a good start for Worthington Enterprises. Higher volume and margins in Consumer Products and contributions from Building Products driving results. Strong balance sheet and available capital to seize opportunities. Negative Decrease in net sales by 8.5% compared to the prior year quarter. Negative impact from Separation costs and one-time charge to income tax expense. Non-cash charge to settle unfunded benefit obligation of the last remaining pension plan. Continued softness in Europe from Sustainable Energy Solutions business. Financial Analyst The reported financials by Worthington Enterprises, Inc. indicate a mixed performance with a decline in net sales and net earnings from continuing operations compared to the previous fiscal year. This performance can be attributed to several factors, including the separation of the Steel Processing business and the various charges incurred during the quarter. Notably, the decrease in net sales within the Building Products segment, due to unfavorable mix and slightly lower volumes, is a point of concern.The company's decision to redeem its senior unsecured notes ahead of maturity reflects a strategic approach to debt management and a strong liquidity position, as evidenced by the significant reduction in total debt and the cash position reported. The financial restructuring post-Separation and the impact of non-recurring items such as the pension settlement charge and one-time tax effects should be closely evaluated by investors for their influence on the company's financial health and future earnings potential.Furthermore, the introduction of adjusted EBITDA as a measure for evaluating segment results suggests a shift in the company's internal performance assessment criteria, which may provide a clearer picture of the operational efficiency and could be a positive signal for investors looking for sustainable profitability. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Worthington Enterprises' financial results and strategic moves, such as the acquisition of an 80 percent ownership stake in an affiliate of HALO Products Group, LLC, indicate an ongoing effort to diversify and strengthen their market position. The focus on outdoor cooking space through HALO Products Group aligns with consumer trends towards home-based leisure activities, which have been on the rise.However, the company's mention of 'continued softness in Europe from our Sustainable Energy Solutions business' raises questions about the global economic environment's impact on the company's international operations. Investors should consider the potential risks associated with geopolitical uncertainties and market fluctuations that could affect future performance, especially in sectors sensitive to such changes.The commitment to a quarterly dividend despite the current financial setbacks demonstrates confidence in the company's cash flow stability and could be a reassuring factor for shareholders. Yet, it's important to monitor how the company balances shareholder returns with the need for reinvestment in growth and innovation. Economist An economist's viewpoint would highlight the broader economic implications of Worthington Enterprises' financial results. The decline in net sales and earnings from continuing operations could be reflective of macroeconomic headwinds such as supply chain disruptions or changes in commodity prices. The separation of the Steel Processing business, now Worthington Steel, may also signal a strategic realignment to focus on core competencies and adapt to market demands.The increase in equity income, primarily from WAVE, indicates potential strength in partnerships and joint ventures, which can be a strategic lever for growth in uncertain economic times. Additionally, the company's proactive debt management, as seen in the redemption of the senior unsecured notes, may suggest a cautious approach in anticipation of potential interest rate fluctuations or economic downturns.Investors should also consider the implications of the company's tax rate increase and how changes in tax policies or potential legislative reforms could affect future profitability. The adjusted effective tax rate may offer a more normalized view of tax obligations, excluding one-time items related to the separation. 03/20/2024 - 04:30 PM COLUMBUS, Ohio, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Worthington Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE: WOR) reported net sales of $316.8 million and net earnings from continuing operations of $22.0 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for its fiscal 2024 third quarter ended February 29, 2024. This compares to net sales of $346.3 million and net earnings from continuing operations of $29.8 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. On an adjusted basis, the Company reported net earnings from continuing operations of $40.2 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, for the current year quarter compared to adjusted net earnings from continuing operations of $39.9 million, or $0.81 per share, in the prior year quarter. As previously disclosed, the separation of the Company’s former Steel Processing business into an independent publicly traded company, Worthington Steel, Inc. (“Worthington Steel”), was completed on December 1, 2023 (the “Separation”). Accordingly, the results of Worthington Steel are presented as discontinued operations separate from the Company’s continuing operations in periods prior to the Separation. Earnings from discontinued operations include operating expenses only to the extent directly attributable to Worthington Steel. Indirect corporate overhead costs are included in continuing operations, and, to the extent eliminated post-Separation, have been included as an adjustment to earnings from continuing operations in periods prior to the Separation in the table below. The third quarter of fiscal 2024 was negatively impacted by the final Separation costs, as well as a one-time charge to income tax expense primarily related to non-deductible transaction costs. In addition, the current year quarter was negatively impacted by a non-cash charge to settle, in full, the unfunded benefit obligation of our last remaining pension plan. Results in both the current year quarter and the prior year quarter were impacted by certain other items that have been excluded from net earnings from continuing operations, as summarized in the table below. (U.S. dollars in millions, except per share amounts)3Q 2024 3Q 2023 After-Tax Per Share After-Tax Per Share Net earnings from continuing operations $22.0 $0.44 $29.8 $0.60 Corporate costs eliminated at Separation - - 7.9 0.16 True-up of Level5 earnout accrual - - (0.8) (0.02)Impairment and restructuring charges 0.5 0.01 0.9 0.03 Separation costs 2.3 0.05 1.8 0.04 Pension settlement charge 6.2 0.12 - - Loss on sale of investment in ArtiFlex - - 0.3 - One-time tax effects of Separation 9.2 0.18 - - Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations $40.2 $0.80 $39.9 $0.81 “We are off to a good start with our first full quarter as Worthington Enterprises reporting adjusted earnings of $0.80 per share,” said Worthington Enterprises President and CEO Andy Rose. “Higher volume and margins in our Consumer Products business combined with healthy contributions from our Building Products segment drove results, offset by continued softness in Europe from our Sustainable Energy Solutions business. We appreciate our employees’ continued dedication to delivering value-added products for our customers every day.” Financial highlights for the current year periods and prior year comparative periods are as follows: (U.S. dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 3Q 2024 3Q 2023 9M 2024 9M 2023 Net sales $316.8 $346.3 $926.9 $1,049.7 Operating income (loss) 4.3 4.0 (17.4) 14.5 Adjusted operating income 8.0 16.9 15.1 49.3 Net earnings from continuing operations 22.0 29.8 66.8 75.6 Adjusted EBITDA 66.9 70.2 187.8 212.3 EPS from continuing operations - diluted 0.44 0.60 1.33 1.53 Adjusted EPS from continuing operations - diluted $0.80 $0.81 $2.11 $2.39 Consolidated Quarterly Results Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were $316.8 million, a decrease of $29.6 million, or 8.5%, from the prior year quarter, as unfavorable mix combined with slightly lower volumes led to a $35.6 million decrease in net sales within Building Products. Operating income of $4.3 million was up slightly from $4.0 million in the prior year quarter. On an adjusted basis, operating income of $8.0 million was down $8.9 million from the prior year quarter, on the combined impact of lower gross profit, which was down $5.9 million due to lower contributions from Building Products and Sustainable Energy Solutions, partially offset by improvements within Consumer Products, and higher overall SG&A expense, up $3 million, excluding the impact of corporate costs in the prior year quarter that were eliminated post-Separation. Miscellaneous expense increased $7.2 million from the prior year quarter primarily due to a pension lift-out transaction to transfer, in full, the remaining projected benefit obligation of the inactive Gerstenslager pension plan to a third-party insurance company, which resulted in an $8.1 million pre-tax non-cash charge. Net interest expense was nominal in the current year quarter compared to $4.2 million in the prior year quarter due to higher interest income and, to a lesser extent, lower average debt levels driven by the July 28, 2023, redemption of the Company’s senior unsecured notes that were set to mature in April 2026 (“2026 Notes”). Equity income increased $6.1 million over the prior year quarter to $43.2 million, primarily due to higher contributions from WAVE. Income tax expense was $18.5 million in the current year quarter compared to $7.4 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by discrete tax adjustments primarily related to the Separation. Current quarter income tax expense reflects an estimated annual effective rate of 30.8%, up from 22.6% in the prior year quarter, due to the impact of discrete tax items, including one-time charges triggered by the Separation consisting primarily of non-deductible transaction costs. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 23.1% in the current year quarter compared to 20.9% in the prior year quarter. Balance Sheet Total debt was $298.0 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024, down approximately $390 million from May 31, 2023, due to the early redemption of senior unsecured notes of an equal amount in fiscal 2024, including $150.0 million in December 2023 that was funded by a cash distribution received from Worthington Steel immediately prior to the Separation. The Company ended the third quarter of fiscal 2024 with cash of $227.3 million. Quarterly Segment Results Effective December 1, 2023, management responsibilities at the propane tank manufacturing facility in Westerville, Ohio, were realigned under Building Products from Consumer Products. Additionally, during the third quarter, management began evaluating segment results on the basis of adjusted EBITDA, as defined and further described in the Use of Non-GAAP Measures and Definitions section below. Financial results below, including historical data, reflect these changes. Consumer Products generated net sales of $133.2 million during the current year quarter, up $2.5 million, or 1.9%, over the prior year quarter on higher volume, partially offset by lower average selling prices. Adjusted EBITDA was up $4.5 million in the quarter to $25.6 million, driven by the impact of higher volume. Building Products generated net sales of $148.2 million during the current year quarter, down 19%, or $35.6 million, from the prior year quarter primarily due to an unfavorable shift in product mix. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $5.0 million from the prior year quarter to $53.1 million, as unfavorable mix compressed gross profit. Higher contributions of equity income, driven by a $7.1 million increase at WAVE, partially offset the impact of lower gross profit. Sustainable Energy Solutions generated net sales of $35.4 million during the current year quarter, up $3.6 million, or 11.3%, over the prior year quarter, on higher volume. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $2.7 million, unfavorable by $2.9 million from the prior year quarter, as volumes remained too low to absorb the fixed costs in the business. Recent Developments In connection with the Separation, the Company received a cash distribution of $150.0 million from Worthington Steel, which was used to redeem, in full, the unsecured senior notes that were set to mature in August 2024.On February 1, 2024, the Company acquired an 80 percent ownership stake in an affiliate of HALO Products Group, LLC. Halo is an asset-light business with technology-enabled solutions in the outdoor cooking space with products that include HALO™ branded pizza ovens, pellet grills, griddles and other accessories. The total purchase price was approximately $9.4 million.On March 20, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.16 per common share payable on June 28, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 14, 2024. Outlook “Worthington Enterprises is operating well as we head into our fourth quarter,” Rose said. “We have well vetted strategies and strong teams with high expectations for delivering on our promise of increasing shareholder value.

Excludes a pre-tax loss of $1,534 realized in connection with the July 28, 2023, early redemption of the 2026 Notes. The loss resulted primarily from unamortized issuance costs and discount included in the carrying amount of the 2026 Notes and the acceleration of the remaining unamortized loss in equity related to a treasury lock derivative instrument executed in connection with the issuance of the 2026 Notes.Reflects reductions in certain corporate overhead costs that no longer exist post-Separation. These costs were included in continuing operations as they represent general corporate overhead that was historically allocated to Worthington Steel but did not meet the requirements to be presented as discontinued operations.

USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES AND DEFINITIONS NON-GAAP MEASURES. These materials include certain financial measures that are not calculated and precented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The non-GAAP financial measures typically exclude items that management believes are not reflective of, and thus should not be included when evaluating the performance of the Company’s ongoing operations. Management uses the non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company’s performance, engage in financial and operational planning, and determine incentive compensation. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information and additional perspective on the performance of the Company’s ongoing operations and should not be considered as an alternative to the comparable GAAP measure. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP measures allow for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the Company’s businesses and enables investors to evaluate operations and future prospects in the same manner as management. The following provides an explanation of each non-GAAP measure presented in these materials: Adjusted operating income is defined as operating income (loss) excluding the items listed below, to the extent naturally included in operating income (loss). Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations is defined as net earnings from continuing operations attributable to controlling interest (“net earnings from continuing operations”) excluding the after-tax effect of the excluded items outlined below. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations (“Adjusted EPS from continuing operations”) – is defined as adjusted net earnings from continuing operations divided by diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Adjusted EBITDA – Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. EBITDA is calculated by adding or subtracting, as appropriate, interest expense, net, income tax expense, depreciation, and amortization to/from net earnings from continuing operations attributable to controlling interest, which is further adjusted to exclude impairment and restructuring charges (gains) as well as other items that management believes are not reflective of, and thus should not be included when evaluating the performance of its ongoing operations, as outlined below. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes stock-based compensation due to its non-cash nature, which is consistent with how management assesses operating performance. At the segment level, adjusted EBITDA includes expense allocations for centralized corporate back-office functions that exist to support the day-to-day business operations. Public company and other governance costs are held at the corporate level. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by net sales. Exclusions from Non-GAAP Financial Measures Management believes it is useful to exclude the following items from the non-GAAP measures presented in this report for its own and investors’ assessment of the business for the reasons identified below: Impairment charges are excluded because they do not occur in the ordinary course of our ongoing business operations, are inherently unpredictable in timing and amount, and are non-cash, which we believe facilitates the comparison of historical, current and forecasted financial results.Restructuring activities, which can result in both discrete gains and/or losses, consist of established programs that are not part of our ongoing operations, such as divestitures, closing or consolidating facilities, employee severance (including rationalizing headcount or other significant changes in personnel), and realignment of existing operations (including changes to management structure in response to underlying performance and/or changing market conditions). These items are excluded because they are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business.Separation costs, which consist of direct and incremental costs incurred in connection with the completed Separation are excluded as they are one-time in nature and are not expected to occur in period following the Separation. These costs include fees paid to third-party advisors, such as investment banking, audit and other advisory services as well as direct and incremental costs associated with the Separation of shared corporate functions. Results in the current fiscal year also include incremental compensation expense associated with the modification of unvested short and long-term incentive compensation awards, as required under the employee matters agreement executed in conjunction with the Separation.Loss on early extinguishment of debt is excluded because it does not occur in the normal course of business and may obscure analysis of trends and financial performance. Additionally, the amount and frequency of this type of charge is not consistent and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of debt extinguishment transactions.Pension settlement charges are excluded because of their non-cash nature and the fact that they do not occur in the normal course of business and may obscure analysis of trends and financial performance. These transactions typically result from the transfer of all or a portion of the total projected benefit obligation to third-party insurance companies. PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION. These materials include certain financial data and operating metrics that are presented on a pro forma basis to illustrate the estimated effects of the Separation of Worthington Steel from the historical combined company, which was consummated on December 1, 2023, and to give effect to divested operations historically presented within Other. Management believes these pro forma measures provide investors with useful supplemental financial information regarding the performance of the Company’s continuing operations after reflecting the Separation. This pro forma financial information has been prepared based upon the best available information and management estimates and is subject to assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying footnotes. They are not intended to be a complete presentation of the Company’s financial position or results of operations had the Separation occurred as of and for the periods indicated. In addition, the pro forma financial information is being provided for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the Company’s future results of operations or financial condition had the Separation and related transactions been completed on the dates assumed. Management believes these assumptions and estimates are reasonable, given the information available on the filing date. Sonya L.

(RETO) announces regaining compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement and receiving an extension to meet stockholders' equity criteria. The Company's notification from Nasdaq marks a positive step towards maintaining its listing on the stock exchange. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst ReTo Eco-Solutions' recent compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement is a positive signal to investors who track regulatory compliance as a metric for financial stability. The compliance lifts any immediate threat of delisting, which can severely impact a company's stock liquidity and investor perception. The extension granted to meet the minimum stockholders' equity criteria suggests the company is being proactive in managing its financial health. However, the requirement to file a Form 20-F by May 15 to demonstrate compliance adds a timeline for investors to monitor, as failure to meet this deadline could raise concerns about the company's governance and operational efficiency. Financial Analyst The notice from Nasdaq regarding ReTo Eco-Solutions' bid price suggests that the company's stock had been trading below the $1 threshold, which is often considered a red flag for financial health and can deter institutional investors. By regaining compliance, ReTo may see improved investor confidence and potentially more institutional investment. The focus on the upcoming Form 20-F filing is important for evaluating the company's financials, particularly stockholders' equity, which is an indicator of the company's net value and financial leverage. Investors should keep an eye on the company's ability to maintain or improve its equity levels, as this can affect credit ratings and the ability to raise capital. Compliance Specialist Regaining compliance with Nasdaq's listing rules is a critical step for ReTo Eco-Solutions in maintaining its listing and avoiding the consequences of a delisting process. Compliance with these rules indicates a minimum level of financial viability that must be maintained to remain in the good graces of the exchange. The extension to regain compliance with stockholders' equity criteria indicates that Nasdaq sees potential in the company's ability to rectify its financial position. It's important to note that while the company has been given an opportunity to demonstrate its financial stability, it remains under scrutiny until the Form 20-F is filed and accepted by Nasdaq. 03/20/2024 - 04:30 PM BEIJING, March 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ReTo Eco-Solutions, Inc.

Despite a decline in global bullion demand, the company showcased adaptability and profitability. Envela invested in business expansion, with plans to double store footprint by 2024, focusing on re-commerce solutions and strategic retail expansion. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported financial results from Envela Corporation, with annual revenue of $171.7 million and earnings per share of $0.27, are indicative of a stable financial performance despite the noted decline in global bullion demand. The company's strategy to invest in store expansions and staff training, even as operating expenses rise, suggests a forward-looking approach aimed at capturing more market share in the re-commerce space. The expansion plan, which includes doubling the store footprint, is an aggressive growth strategy that could potentially increase revenue streams and customer base.Furthermore, the emphasis on customer loyalty through transparency and value could resonate well with consumers, especially in the luxury pre-owned market where trust is a significant factor. This approach could lead to a virtuous cycle of repeat business and referrals, which are vital in retail. However, investors should be attentive to the execution risks associated with rapid expansion and the ability of the company to maintain profitability during this growth phase. Financial Analyst Envela's performance in a declining bullion market underscores its operational resilience and adaptability. The earnings per share (EPS) of $0.27 for the year and $0.05 for the quarter reflect a company that is managing to maintain profitability in challenging conditions. The planned store expansion is a capital-intensive move that could impact short-term profitability due to increased operating expenses. However, if the expansion captures additional market share and drives sales volume, it could be accretive to earnings in the long run.Investors should monitor the company's debt levels and liquidity position as they embark on this expansion. The retail environment is highly competitive and Envela will need to ensure that its new stores are strategically located and that the staff is well-trained to differentiate their customer service. The company's focus on the re-commerce sector, which is gaining traction as consumers become more environmentally conscious, could be a growth catalyst. Economist Envela's strategic decision to expand in the midst of a global bullion demand decline can be seen as a counter-cyclical investment, which may pay off if the economy rebounds and consumer spending increases. The re-commerce market is growing as sustainability becomes a more significant factor in consumer purchasing decisions. The company's plan to double its retail footprint could position it well to take advantage of this trend.However, the broader economic context cannot be ignored. If consumer confidence wanes or if there is an economic downturn, luxury and discretionary spending are typically among the first to be cut, which could impact Envela's growth projections. The success of the expansion will depend on the company's ability to navigate these macroeconomic factors while executing its strategy effectively. 03/20/2024 - 04:15 PM DALLAS, TX / ACCESSWIRE / March 20, 2024 / Envela Corporation (NYSE American:ELA) (""Envela"" or the ""Company""), today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.

For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Company reported revenue of $36.7 million and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $0.05.Management CommentaryConsumer Division""Despite a significant decline in global bullion demand in the latter half of 2023, our performance was exceptional, highlighting Envela's capability to adjust swiftly to a changing market landscape. The Company's results demonstrate the strength of our business model and the adaptability of our operating entities in managing a fluctuating market, enabling us to remain profitable in slower market conditions,"" said John Loftus, Envela's CEO.""In 2023, we made considerable progress strengthening Envela's position as a leading provider of re-commerce solutions to both businesses and consumers. During the year, we further invested in our business in anticipation of our 2024 store expansion. As a result, operating expenses increased, including for recruiting and training specialized staff for upcoming store launches. Demand for jewelry continues to be strong, and we anticipate our Consumer Division will see an improved bottom line in 2024, driven by the opening of new stores,"" Loftus added.""As we move into 2024, our excitement builds as we anticipate connecting with new customers through the Company's strategic retail expansion. Announced last year, we planned to open at least 3 new retail locations in at least 2 new metro areas and double our current footprint from 7 to 14 stores by the end of 2024. The opening of three new Arizona stores marks the launch of this strategy and keeps us on track for 7 new stores by year's end,"" Loftus remarked.""We believe in great value and providing our customers with comprehensive information and complete transparency. This engenders loyalty, which is key to our business success. And our expansion underscores Envela's commitment to providing a next-level experience to our customers, recognizing that many prefer visiting a physical store for personalized advice before selling their luxury preowned items,"" concluded Loftus.Commercial Division""In 2023, we maintained our close partnerships with some of the world's largest multinational corporations and many of America's leading retailers and technology companies to meet their re-commerce requirements. With our focus on building lasting customer relationships, we are optimistic about Envela's role as an essential partner for our clients as their needs evolve. Our dedication to the circular economy-prioritizing the reuse, repair, refurbishment, and recycling of materials and products-guides our mission. By extending products' lives, we not only aid the environment but also enable consumers to purchase goods at more affordable prices,"" said Loftus.""Envela is actively exploring investment opportunities to expand its geographical footprint and market penetration.

The transceiver supports a wider temperature range and low power consumption, expanding deployment opportunities. Positive None. Negative None. Telecommunications Analyst The introduction of Coherent Corp's I-temp 100G ZR QSFP28 digital coherent optics (DCO) transceiver is a noteworthy development in the telecommunications industry. This product is designed to withstand a wider operating temperature range, making it suitable for outdoor deployment in edge and access networks. The significance of this advancement lies in its potential to enable more reliable and robust network infrastructure, particularly in harsh environmental conditions.The use of Coherent's internally developed Steelerton™ digital signal processor (DSP) for power optimization is a competitive edge that addresses the industry's need for energy-efficient solutions. The product's compatibility with existing QSFP28 ports on access network equipment such as optical line terminals and aggregation switches indicates a strategic move to facilitate easy integration and adoption by network operators, potentially reducing the need for costly infrastructure upgrades.As the first to extend performance to the industrial temperature range, Coherent Corp is positioning itself as an innovator in the field. This could lead to increased market share and open up new deployment opportunities, particularly in regions with extreme temperature variations. However, the long-term success of this product will depend on its reliability, cost-effectiveness and the overall market demand for such high-temperature range capabilities. Market Research Analyst The release of Coherent Corp's new transceiver variant is likely to have implications for the company's market positioning and financial performance. The telecommunications equipment market is highly competitive, with constant innovation being a key driver of success. By being the first to market with a transceiver capable of operating in an industrial temperature range, Coherent may be able to secure a first-mover advantage, potentially leading to an increase in sales and market penetration in the near term.Customer interest in the previously launched products suggests a favorable market response to Coherent's offerings. The company's focus on expanding the applications and use cases for its 100G ZR QSFP28-DCO transceiver family could also suggest a strategic move to diversify its customer base and reduce reliance on a single market segment.Investors should monitor the adoption rate of these new transceivers and Coherent's ability to capitalize on the interest it has generated. Positive customer feedback and successful deployments could signal a strong revenue stream, while any production or quality issues could negatively impact the company's reputation and financials. Financial Analyst Coherent Corp's announcement of its new I-temp 100G ZR QSFP28-DCO transceiver is an event that could influence the company's financial trajectory. The product's introduction is a strategic step that may lead to increased revenue streams from new and existing customers seeking to upgrade their network infrastructure with more versatile and durable components.Investors should consider the potential impact on Coherent's operating margins, given the investment in research and development required to create such a product. The company's ability to manage production costs while maintaining quality and performance will be important in determining the profitability of this new offering. Additionally, the transceiver's lower power consumption is aligned with the industry's trend towards energy efficiency, which may drive demand and provide cost savings for end-users.It is also important to evaluate Coherent's supply chain resilience and capacity to meet potential increases in demand. Any supply chain disruptions or inability to scale production could hinder the company's ability to fully capitalize on this innovation. Conversely, successful market penetration and customer satisfaction could enhance Coherent's brand reputation and lead to a stronger competitive position in the market. 03/20/2024 - 04:30 PM PITTSBURGH, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Coherent Corp. (NYSE: COHR), a leading provider of high-performance optical networking solutions, today introduced its versatile I-temp 100G ZR QSFP28 digital coherent optics (DCO) transceiver. Designed for deployment in outdoor street cabinets and pole-mount physical plants in edge and access networks, the Coherent I-temp 100G ZR QSFP28-DCO transceiver is ideal for customers who need transceivers that support a wider operating temperature range. These transceivers can be installed directly onto already deployed access network equipment with QSFP28 ports. Examples include optical line terminals (OLTs) and aggregation switches and routers for midhaul and backhaul applications. “The Coherent 100G ZR QSFP28-DCO platform is built on our internally developed 100G digital signal processor. We are excited to continue to add new product variants that serve our customers’ needs, like the high transmit output power version for metro ROADM applications that was announced last fall and the industrial operating temperature version that we are announcing today,” said Matthias Berger, VP, Coherent Technology. “Since the launch of these products, we’ve experienced tremendous interest, and we believe that with these new versions, we can continue to grow the number of applications and use cases for the 100G ZR QSFP28-DCO transceiver family, pushing coherent technology ever further toward the network edge.” Utilizing the Steelerton™ digital signal processor (DSP), a purpose-built DSP component family launched in 2022, the new module is optimized for the lowest power consumption in a compact transceiver size. The DSP is paired with an efficient silicon photonics optical front-end and a power-optimized tunable laser, now enhanced to support a wider operating temperature range, resulting in module power consumption of less than 6 W at a case temperature of 85°C. In 2023, Coherent was the first to offer this solution in C-temp (commercial temperature: 0°C to 70°C). The company is now the first in the industry to extend its performance to the industrial temperature range to enable even broader deployment opportunities. About Coherent Coherent empowers market innovators to define the future through breakthrough technologies, from materials to systems. We deliver innovations that resonate with our customers in diversified applications for the industrial, communications, electronics, and instrumentation markets. Headquartered in Saxonburg, Pennsylvania, Coherent has research and development, manufacturing, sales, service, and distribution facilities worldwide.

(NYSE: EPAC) reported solid second-quarter results despite a 2% decline in net sales, with organic sales up 2%. Gross margin expanded to 51.6%, and adjusted EBITDA increased by 6% year-over-year. The company remains on track to achieve full-year guidance and long-term financial objectives. Positive Solid second-quarter results with a 2% decline in net sales but a 2% increase in organic sales Gross margin expanded to 51.6%, and adjusted EBITDA grew by 6% year-over-year Operating profit increased by 111% year-over-year, with an operating margin of 21.3% Adjusted operating margin expanded to 22.8%, a 260 basis point improvement over the prior year Net earnings and diluted EPS increased significantly compared to the year-ago period The company affirms its fiscal 2024 guidance with projected net sales of $590 million to $605 million Forecasting organic sales growth of 2% to 4% and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $142 million to $152 million Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 2% decline in net sales to $138 million for Enerpac Tool Group Corp. is indicative of a challenging macro environment, particularly within the industrial sector. However, the organic sales growth of 2% suggests resilience in the company's core operations, independent of foreign exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures. The expansion of the gross margin to 51.6% reflects effective pricing strategies and a favorable sales mix, which are key metrics for profitability. Additionally, the operating margin growth to 21.3% and adjusted operating margin to 22.8% demonstrate improved operational efficiency. These figures, coupled with a 6% year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA, hint at strong cost management and operational leverage.The net earnings increase to $18 million, or $0.33 per share and adjusted net earnings to $20 million, or $0.36 per share, are significant when compared to the previous year's figures. This performance could positively influence investor sentiment and potentially impact the company's stock price. The improved net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 0.7x from 0.9x reflects a healthier balance sheet, which is a positive sign for investors concerned about financial stability and debt management. The share repurchase activity also signals confidence in the company's valuation and future prospects.For stakeholders, the reaffirmed fiscal 2024 guidance with projected net sales of $590 million to $605 million and adjusted EBITDA of $142 million to $152 million provides a clear expectation of the company's financial trajectory. The anticipated organic sales growth of 2% to 4% is modest but positive and the targeted adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 25% for fiscal 2025 sets an ambitious goal for the company's future performance. Market Research Analyst Enerpac's performance in the context of the broader industrial sector slowdown is notable. The company's ability to achieve organic sales growth in its Industrial Tools & Services segment, which outpaces the market, suggests competitive strength and effective market positioning. This is particularly relevant for investors seeking companies with the ability to navigate challenging economic climates.The report highlights a disciplined approach to cost management, with Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses decreasing significantly due to lower program expenses and a focus on managing discretionary spending. This could be interpreted as a strategic move to streamline operations and optimize the cost structure, which is essential in maintaining profitability during periods of slow growth or market contraction.The cash flow improvement, with net cash provided by operating activities at $13.3 million compared to a use of $7.8 million in the prior year, is a strong indicator of the company's operational efficiency and financial health. This positive cash flow development is likely to be received well by investors, as it suggests the company has ample liquidity to fund operations, invest in growth opportunities, or return value to shareholders. Investment Strategist From an investment perspective, the expanded adjusted EBITDA margin and the reduced net debt level are key indicators of Enerpac's financial robustness. The company's strategic focus on margin expansion and working capital management may contribute to a favorable investment profile in the long term. The share repurchase program, reflecting a return of capital to shareholders, could be seen as a positive signal regarding the company's future earnings potential and management's confidence in the stock's value.However, it's important to contextualize the 2% year-over-year sales decline. While the company has managed to grow organically, the decline points to possible external pressures or market challenges that investors should monitor. The outlook remains cautiously optimistic with a reaffirmation of the fiscal 2024 guidance, but investors should consider the potential impacts of global economic trends and currency fluctuations on future performance.The forecasted free cash flow between $60 million to $70 million is another critical factor for investors, as it suggests that the company expects to maintain a solid cash position, enabling it to navigate potential market uncertainties. The absence of a broad-based global recession in the company's assumptions is also a key consideration, as any deviation from this scenario could significantly impact the company's performance and, consequently, investor returns. 03/20/2024 - 04:30 PM Second Quarter of Fiscal 2024 Continuing Operations Highlights* Net sales were $138 million, a 2% decline year-over-year, due to the disposition of Cortland IndustrialOrganic sales increased 2% year-over-year**Gross margin expanded 200 basis points year-over-year to 51.6%Operating margin was 21.3% and adjusted operating margin was 22.8%Net earnings were $18 million, or $0.33 per share, and adjusted net earnings were $20 million, or $0.36 per shareAdjusted EBITDA was $34 million, an increase of 6% year-over-yearAdjusted EBITDA margin was 24.8%, an expansion of 210 basis points year-over-year *This press release contains financial measures in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) in addition to non-GAAP financial measures.

(NYSE: EPAC) (the “Company” or “Enerpac”) today announced results for its fiscal second quarter ended February 29, 2024. “Enerpac posted solid second quarter results despite the broader macro environment and an overall slowdown in the industrial sector,” said Paul Sternlieb, Enerpac Tool Group’s President & CEO. “We were particularly pleased with the margin expansion, as we made further progress improving operating efficiency and SG&A productivity. Moreover, we believe organic sales growth in our Industrial Tools & Services (IT&S) segment continues to outpace the market. Given our solid performance through the first half of fiscal 2024, we remain on track to achieve our full-year guidance and longer-term financial objectives.” Consolidated Results from Continuing Operations(US$ in millions, except per share) Three Months Ended Six Months Ended February 29, 2024 February 28, 2023 February 29, 2024 February 28, 2023Net Sales$138.4 $142.0 $280.4 $281.3Operating Profit$29.5 $14.0 $58.2 $26.3Adjusted Operating Profit$31.5 $28.7 $64.0 $51.8Net Earnings$17.9 $7.2 $36.2 $13.6Diluted EPS$0.33 $0.12 $0.66 $0.24Adjusted Diluted EPS$0.36 $0.35 $0.76 $0.65Adjusted EBITDA$34.3 $32.2 $69.2 $58.8 Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Consolidated Results Comparisons Consolidated net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 were $138.4 million compared to $142.0 million in the prior-year period, a decrease of 2.5%. Organic sales, excluding the disposition of Cortland Industrial and the impact of foreign currency, increased 1.8% year-over-year, with product sales up 2.4%, partially offset by a 0.8% service revenue decline. Net sales growth for the Industrial Tools & Services (IT&S) reportable segment of 3.0%, with organic sales growth of 2.8%, was partly offset by a year-over-year decline at Cortland Biomedical, which comprises the Other operating segment. Gross margin expanded 200 basis points year-over-year to 51.6%, driven by benefits from pricing actions, a favorable sales mix, and the disposition of Cortland Industrial. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $41.1 million were $13.9 million lower year-over-year because of lower ASCEND transformation program expenses, lower restructuring charges, and a continued focus on managing discretionary spending. Adjusted SG&A was 28.4% of sales, down slightly from 28.5% of sales in the year-ago period. Operating profit increased 111% year-over-year to $29.5 million, with an operating profit margin of 21.3%, up from 9.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Adjusted operating profit increased 9.7% to $31.5 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 22.8%, a 260 basis point expansion over the prior-year period. Second quarter fiscal 2024 net earnings and diluted EPS were $17.9 million and $0.33, respectively, compared to $7.2 million and $0.12, respectively, in the year-ago period. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $34.3 million compared to $32.2 million in the year-ago period, achieving an adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.8%, up from 22.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities was $13.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to a use of $7.8 million in the prior-year period. The increase in cash from operations was primarily due to the timing of annual incentive compensation payments and lower ASCEND transformation payments as well as higher net earnings. In addition, the Company continues to drive improvements in working capital management and inventory efficiency.

IT&S Results Comparisons Second quarter fiscal 2024 net sales for IT&S were $134.8 million, ahead 3.0% year-over-year with organic growth of 2.8%. Organic growth was driven by pricing actions and favorable mix in product sales, partially offset by a slight decline in service. The segment’s operating profit margin increased 450 basis points to 27.8% and adjusted operating profit margin improved 230 basis points to 28.9%. Corporate Expenses from Continuing Operations Corporate expenses were $7.8 million and $17.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. The year-over-year decline was driven by significantly lower ASCEND-related charges during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Adjusted corporate expenses(2) of $7.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 were flat compared to the prior year. (2) Excludes a favorable restructuring charges adjustment of $0.1 million and $0.6 million of ASCEND charges in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to $0.4 million of restructuring charges, $9.5 million of ASCEND charges, $0.2 million of leadership transition charges, and $0.2 million of M&A charges in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.

These measures are not calculated based upon GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings or diluted earnings per share or as an indicator of the Company's operating performance. However, this presentation is important to investors for understanding the operating results of the current portfolio of Enerpac Tool Group companies. For all reconciliations of GAAP measures to Non-GAAP measures, the summation of the individual components may not equal the total due to rounding. With respect to the earnings per share reconciliations the impact of share dilution on the calculation of the net earnings or loss per share and discontinued operations per share may result in the summation of these components not equaling the total earnings per share from continuing operations.

The report highlights the impact of government mandates on brokers' service offerings and the increasing demand for voluntary benefits products among employers. Positive None. Negative None. 03/20/2024 - 04:15 PM Eighth annual survey also indicates brokers remain a critical component in managing employer healthcare costs, while revealing employers offering more voluntary benefits products CARMEL, Ind., March 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Optavise, a one-stop-shop for employee benefits programs, combining voluntary benefits products and services, technology and expert guidance, today released its 2024 Annual Benefits Broker Report, ""Government Mandates Take Center Stage: Unveiling the Dominant Market Force for Benefits Brokers."" Findings from the eighth annual Optavise report show that while clients continue to request new, innovative ideas to combat rising healthcare costs, they are looking to their broker partners for help with regulatory- and compliance-related issues more than other factors. Optavise surveyed 70 U.S.-based health insurance brokers, representing the top 15 brokerage firms, for the report. Among the key highlights: 69% of brokers cite ever-changing federal and state mandates as a leading market force driving their firms to add new products and service offerings.44% of brokers state that compliance is one of the top three issues for which employers request their services, trailing only new and innovative ideas for cost containment (57%) and benefits communications support and strategies (46%).94% of brokers report high or moderate reliance by their employer clients for compliance and reporting related to their healthcare benefits.""We've seen an increase in both state and federal reporting requirements as well as regulations on the types of benefits which can be offered within a given state, which are driving a sharper focus on compliance,"" said Kim Buckey, vice president, client services, Optavise. ""The myriad regulations that govern employee benefits can carry significant financial and even legal ramifications for employers, whether through fines, penalties and potential litigation costs. Many of these issues can have a direct impact on employee satisfaction and engagement, and employers are increasingly looking toward brokers for support."" Brokers remain a key player in healthcare cost management As employers continue to ask their broker partners to help manage their healthcare costs, they are particularly interested in prescription drug management programs (77%) as a cost-control measure. ""In an effort to control costs, we are seeing more employers implementing programs that include mandatory generic prescriptions, mandatory mail order, step programs and partnering with various healthcare entities,"" said Buckey. Other popular cost control measures include shifting to (or from) self-insured coverage (68%), implementing point solutions to target specific health needs (60%) and adding clinical advocacy to help employees become better healthcare consumers (55%). Another increase in voluntary benefits products The number of employers adding voluntary benefits products to their portfolios continues to grow (73%, up from 64% from 2023). Nearly half (49%) of broker survey participants note that voluntary benefits provide ""a lot of value to their business,"" with another 45% reporting they provide at least some value. The three most popular voluntary products continue to be accident (65%, down from 71%), critical Illness (63%, down from 68%) and hospital indemnity (49%, up from 39%). Other voluntary products gaining traction include pet insurance (23%, up from 19%) and ID theft protection insurance (22%, up from 13%) and legal services (15%, up from 11%). Additionally, reflecting an aging population, potential state coverage requirements and an increased awareness of its need, brokers also reported employer interest in long-term-care insurance, with 17% of brokers ranking it among the top supplemental products their clients have added in the past year. Continued high demand for benefits communications support An increasing number of brokers report seeing high demand for benefits communications support from their current and prospective clients (57%, up from 49% in 2023), while 37% reported moderate demand. Additionally, nearly every broker surveyed provides these services, either directly or in partnership with benefits communications specialists: 96% offer materials such as enrollment guides and brochures, 94% provide compliance communications, 91% provide virtual communications support and 90% provide in-person support. ""Clear, open and consistent communication about benefits is increasingly important,"" said Buckey. ""The more information employees have about the types of options available and how to use them, the more confident they will feel about making the right decisions on their benefits."" MethodologyOptavise surveyed 70 U.S.-based health insurance brokers, representing the top 15 largest insurance brokerage firms on three principal areas: their current service offerings, which services deliver the most business value, and how their models are likely to evolve to help them compete in the coming year.

Personal savings increased 46.4% YOY, leading to strong GDP growth. Services spending outpaced goods spending in 2023, impacting M&A markets. The report discusses the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and predicts a robust Consumer dealmaking market in 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Economist The discussion of consumer balance sheets and their resilience amidst high inflation and tight monetary policy is indicative of underlying economic strength. The increase in personal savings by 46.4% YOY, despite being from a low base, suggests a potential buffer against economic downturns. The GDP growth of 3.3% YOY, surpassing estimates, further supports this view. The shift towards service spending, growing at 7.4% YOY, reflects a change in consumer behavior, possibly driven by a release of pent-up demand post-pandemic and a transition back to experiential spending.From an economic standpoint, the report hints at a more accommodating debt market in the near future, which could influence consumer spending and M&A activity. The labor market and interest rate policy are key factors to watch as they can significantly impact consumer spending power and business investment decisions. The report's anticipation of a 'soft-landing' scenario by the Federal Reserve, avoiding a severe recession, is a positive signal for economic stability and could lead to increased investor confidence in consumer-driven stocks. Market Research Analyst The insights on sector-specific M&A activity, particularly the YOY increases in Food-adjacent sectors and Home Goods, reflect changing consumer priorities and market opportunities. The report's implication that these sectors outperformed others could guide investors towards companies with a strong presence in these areas. The anticipated buyer appetite and a potential bull market in Consumer dealmaking for 2024, as mentioned by Ken Wasik, suggest an optimistic outlook for the Consumer industry.Understanding which sectors are poised to garner buyer interest is important for investors looking to capitalize on industry trends. The report's breakdown of the 12 key consumer sectors provides a detailed landscape of the industry, enabling investors to make informed decisions based on sector performance and M&A prospects. This information is particularly valuable in identifying growth areas and assessing the potential for strategic investments or acquisitions. Financial Analyst The reported resilience of consumer balance sheets in the face of inflation and the shift in spending patterns have implications for the stock market. The stability of consumer demand is a positive indicator for the revenue streams of companies within the Consumer sector. This could result in upward revisions of earnings forecasts and potentially lead to a re-rating of consumer stocks. The report's indication of an easier monetary policy environment could lower borrowing costs, encouraging business expansion and potentially leading to higher stock valuations.Investors may find the report's insights on public market valuations and the performance of specific sectors within the Consumer industry useful for portfolio allocation. The identification of outperforming sectors could signal areas where stock performance may exceed the broader market, offering potential investment opportunities. The visibility over interest rate direction mentioned by Wasik is also significant, as it affects consumer borrowing costs and can influence stock market trends. 03/20/2024 - 04:19 PM BOSTON, March 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Capstone Partners, a leading middle market investment banking firm, released its 2023 Annual Consumer M&A Report, which shares insights into public market valuations, the macroeconomic climate, merger and acquisition (M&A) activity, and an outlook for 2024 industry activity. With extensive knowledge and transaction experience, Capstone Partners' Consumer Investment Banking Team provides unique commentary on 12 key sectors: Apparel, Footwear & Accessories; Automotive Aftermarket; Beauty; Convenience Stores; E-Commerce; Food Processing; Food Distribution; Home Goods; Outdoor Recreation & Enthusiasts; Pet; Sports Technology; and Vitamins & Supplements. The discussion of ""fortress"" balance sheets is often in the context of leading multinational banks and asset management institutions. The concept alludes to creating a highly liquid asset profile that can withstand financial shocks while being able to deploy capital to fund spending pursuits. In 2023, U.S. consumer balance sheets were expected to wither under elevated levels of inflation and a tightened monetary policy environment—however, the level of excess savings and spending power continued to be underestimated. Consumers demonstrated a willingness and capacity to spend on goods and services throughout the year, while market participants continued to miss the mark on when consumer savings would be depleted. Notably, personal savings increased 46.4% year-over-year (YOY), albeit, compared to near historically low savings levels experienced in 2022. This culminated in Q4 gross domestic product (GDP) surging past consensus estimates, increasing 3.3% YOY, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. In 2023, the economy witnessed a substantial shift in spending that heavily favored the Services segment. Personal consumption expenditures on services increased 7.4% YOY, over double the YOY growth experienced by goods spending (3.3%). This marked the widest difference of services spending growth over goods spending growth since 2009. Areas such as Recreation Services, Food Services & Accommodations, and Housing & Utilities Services exceeded overall growth in services spending. Evidence of this trickled into M&A markets, with Food-adjacent sectors and the Home Goods space registering YOY increases in total M&A transaction volume. It remains to be seen if the Federal Reserve can start their victory lap on achieving the heralded soft-landing scenario that dominated headlines throughout the year. At the conclusion of 2023, it seems the U.S. economy has avoided the drastic recession that many market participants had anticipated. Federal funds futures are no longer overwhelmingly pricing in March rate cuts, but directionally, there is clear visibility that the economy is entering an easier monetary policy environment. In the coming quarters, reported earnings among Consumer players will provide insight to the demand backdrop and how resilient spending has remained. In 2024, the labor market, interest rate policy, and the balance sheets of consumers will remain key aspects of the economy monitored by business owners, economists, and M&A market participants. ""For the first time in months the market has visibility over the direction of interest rates. The cost of money will still be meaningful, but debt markets are expected to be much more accommodating over the next six to 12 months than the preceding period. For privately-owned businesses contemplating a liquidity event—2024 will bring significant buyer appetite and may usher a new bull market in Consumer dealmaking,"" said Capstone's Head of Consumer Investment Banking Ken Wasik, the lead contributor in the report.

The Company estimates its share buybacks had a positive impact of $0.23 and currency had a negative impact of $0.04 on adjusted diluted EPS during fiscal 2024 when compared to fiscal 2023. Net Revenue. Total net revenue for fiscal 2024 increased 3% to $2.78 billion, from $2.69 billion in fiscal 2023. In constant currency, net revenue also increased by 3%, driven by the favorable impact on revenue from the additional week in the current year. Europe revenues increased 7% in both U.S. dollars and constant currency. Retail comparable sales (including e-commerce) increased 9% in both U.S. dollars and constant currency. The inclusion of our e-commerce sales negatively impacted the retail comparable sales percentage by 2% in U.S. dollars and 3% in constant currency. Americas Retail revenues decreased 6% in U.S. dollars and 7% in constant currency. Retail comparable sales (including e-commerce) decreased 5% in U.S. dollars and 6% constant currency. The inclusion of our e-commerce sales had a minimal impact on the retail comparable sales percentage in both U.S. dollars and constant currency. Americas Wholesale revenues decreased 3% in U.S. dollars and 6% in constant currency. Asia revenues increased 16% in U.S. dollars and 18% in constant currency. Retail comparable sales (including e-commerce) decreased 2% in U.S. dollars and increased 1% in constant currency.

Licensing revenues increased 9% in both U.S. dollars and constant currency. Earnings from Operations. GAAP earnings from operations for fiscal 2024 increased by 6% to $263.3 million (including $6.9 million in non-cash impairment charges taken on certain long-lived store related assets, $1.7 million net gains on lease modifications and a $2.5 million unfavorable currency translation impact), from $248.2 million (including $9.5 million in non-cash impairment charges taken on certain long-lived store related assets and $2.3 million net gains on lease modifications) in fiscal 2023. GAAP operating margin in fiscal 2024 increased 0.3% to 9.5%, from 9.2% in fiscal 2023, driven primarily by higher initial markups and the favorable impact of business mix and higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses, unfavorable currency impact and lower government subsidies. The negative impact of currency on operating margin for fiscal 2024 was approximately 100 basis points. For fiscal 2024, adjusted earnings from operations decreased 3.0% to $255.0 million, from $262.9 million in fiscal 2023. Adjusted operating margin decreased 0.6% to 9.2% for fiscal 2024, from 9.8% in fiscal 2023, driven primarily by higher expenses, including higher store costs and performance-based compensation, unfavorable currency impact and lower government subsidies, partially offset by higher initial markups and the favorable impact of business mix and higher revenues. Operating margin for the Company’s Europe segment in fiscal 2024 remained relatively flat from fiscal 2023 at 11.6%, driven primarily by higher initial markups and the favorable impact of higher revenues, offset by the unfavorable impact of currency, higher expenses and lower government subsidies compared to the prior year. Operating margin for the Company’s Americas Retail segment decreased 3.5% to 8.0% in fiscal 2024, from 11.5% in fiscal 2023, driven primarily by the unfavorable impact from lower revenues, higher expenses and higher markdowns. Operating margin for the Company’s Americas Wholesale segment increased 4.8% to 27.2% in fiscal 2024, from 22.4% in fiscal 2023, driven primarily by higher product margin, partially offset by higher expenses. Operating margin for the Company’s Asia segment increased 4.9% to 2.9% in fiscal 2024, from negative 2.0% in fiscal 2023, driven primarily by the favorable impact of higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. Operating margin for the Company’s Licensing segment increased 4.2% to 93.3% in fiscal 2024, from 89.1% in fiscal 2023, mainly due to the favorable impact of lower expenses and higher royalties. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. In April 2023, the Company issued $275 million principal amount of Initial 2028 Notes in privately negotiated exchange and subscription agreements with a limited number of holders of its 2024 Notes and certain other investors. As part of these April transactions, the Company exchanged approximately $184.9 million of its 2024 Notes for approximately $163.0 million of Initial 2028 Notes and approximately $33.3 million in cash, and issued $112.0 million of Initial 2028 Notes. Immediately following the closing of these April transactions, approximately $115.0 million of the 2024 Notes remained outstanding and classified within current liabilities. As a result of these April transactions, the Company recognized a $7.7 million loss on extinguishment of debt during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. In January 2024, the Company issued approximately $64.8 million principal amount of Additional 2028 Notes in exchange for approximately $67.1 million of its outstanding 2024 Notes. The Additional 2028 Notes have the same terms, constitute a single series with, and have the same CUSIP number as the Initial 2028 Notes. Immediately following the closing of these January transactions, approximately $48.1 million of the 2024 Notes remained outstanding and classified within current liabilities. As a result of these January transactions, the Company recognized a $4.7 million loss on extinguishment of debt during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Other expense, net. Other expense, net for fiscal 2024 was $5.1 million compared to $39.8 million in fiscal 2023. The change was primarily due to lower net realized and unrealized losses from foreign currency exposures and, to a lesser extent, net unrealized gains compared to net unrealized losses on the Company’s SERP-related assets and foreign exchange currency contracts compared to fiscal 2023. Outlook The Company’s expectations for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2025, which include projected rag & bone results subsequent to the expected closing of the transaction in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, are as follows: Outlook for Total Company1 First Quarter of Fiscal 2025 Fiscal 2025 Consolidated net revenue in U.S. dollars increase between 1.0% and 2.0% increase between 11.5% and 13.5% GAAP operating margin (3.5)% to (3.0)% 7.4% to 8.4% Adjusted operating margin (2.8)% to (2.3)% 7.5% to 8.5% GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share $(0.50) to $(0.46) $2.08 to $2.43 Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share $(0.41) to $(0.37) $2.56 to $3.00 ________________________________________________________ See end of release for footnotes A reconciliation of the Company’s outlook for GAAP operating margin to adjusted operating margin and GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share to adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2025 is as follows: Reconciliation of GAAP Outlook to Adjusted Outlook1 First Quarter of Fiscal 2025 Fiscal 2025 GAAP operating margin (3.5)% to (3.0)% 7.4% to 8.4% Transaction costs2 0.7% 0.1% Adjusted operating margin (2.8)% to (2.3)% 7.5% to 8.5% GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share $(0.50) to $(0.46) $2.08 to $2.43 Transaction costs2 0.08 0.05 Amortization of debt discount2 0.01 0.03 Convertible notes if-converted method2 — 0.40 to 0.49 Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share $(0.41) to $(0.37) $2.56 to $3.00 ________________________________________________________ See end of release for footnotes The Company’s expectations of the high-end for the free cash flow outlook for the full fiscal year 2025 are as follows (in millions): Free Cash Flow Outlook for Total Company1 Fiscal 2025 Net cash provided by operating activities $260 Less: Purchases of property and equipment (90) Less: Payments for property and equipment under finance leases (10) Free cash flow $160 ________________________________________________________ See end of release for footnotes Dividends The Company’s Board of Directors has approved a special cash dividend of $2.25 per share on the Company’s common stock and a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share on the Company’s common stock. Both dividends will be payable on May 3, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 17, 2024. Share Repurchases During April 2023, in connection with the exchange and subscription offering related to the 2024 Notes and the 2028 Notes, the Company repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares of its common stock for $42.5 million through broker-assisted market transactions, pursuant to the Company’s 2021 Share Repurchase Program, leaving a capacity of $19.7 million under its previously announced share repurchase program. During January 2024, in connection with the additional exchange and subscription offering related to the 2024 Notes and the 2028 Notes, the Company repurchased approximately 0.9 million shares of its common stock for $21.1 million through broker-assisted market transactions under its 2021 Share Repurchase Program. The Board of Directors expanded its repurchase authorization by $1.4 million to cover the January 2024 repurchase transactions. As of February 3, 2024, the Company had no remaining authority under the 2021 Share Repurchase Program to purchase its common stock. Presentation of Non-GAAP Information The financial information presented in this release includes non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted results and outlook, constant currency financial information and free cash flows. The adjusted measures exclude the impact of certain professional service and legal fees and related (credits) costs, transaction costs in connection with the Company’s acquisition of rag & bone, asset impairment charges, net (gains) losses on lease modifications, loss on extinguishment of debt, non-cash amortization of debt discount of the Company’s convertible senior notes, fair value remeasurement of derivatives related to the Additional 2028 Notes and convertible note hedge transactions, the related income tax effects of the foregoing items and the impact from certain discrete income tax adjustments related primarily to the consolidation of certain business functions into Switzerland and, to a lesser extent, adjustments from an intra-entity transfer of intellectual property rights from certain U.S. entities to a wholly-owned Swiss subsidiary and the impact from changes in the income tax law in certain tax jurisdictions, in each case where applicable. The weighted average diluted shares outstanding used for adjusted diluted EPS excludes the dilutive impact of the Notes, based on the bond hedge contracts in place. These non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as alternatives for, the Company’s reported GAAP results and outlook. The Company has excluded these items from its adjusted financial measures primarily because it believes these items are not indicative of the underlying performance of its business and the adjusted financial information provided is useful for investors to evaluate the comparability of the Company’s operating results and its future outlook (when reviewed in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financial statements and GAAP future outlook). A reconciliation of reported GAAP results and outlook to comparable non-GAAP results and outlook is provided in the accompanying tables. This release includes certain constant currency financial information. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amount reported from translating the Company’s foreign revenue, expenses and balance sheet amounts into U.S. dollars. These rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on reported operating results under GAAP. The Company provides constant currency information to enhance the visibility of underlying business trends, excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency translation rates. To calculate net revenue and earnings (loss) from operations on a constant currency basis, actual or forecasted results for the current-year period are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable period of the prior year. The constant currency calculations do not adjust for the impact of revaluing specific transactions denominated in a currency different from the functional currency of that entity when exchange rates fluctuate. However, in calculating the estimated impact of currency on our earnings (loss) per share for our actual or forecasted results, the Company estimates gross margin (including the impact of merchandise-related hedges) and expenses using the appropriate prior-year rates, translates the estimated foreign earnings at the comparable prior-year rates, and considers the year-over-year earnings impact of gains or losses arising from balance sheet remeasurement and foreign currency contracts not designated as merchandise hedges. The constant currency information presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company includes information regarding its free cash flows in this release. The Company calculates free cash flows as cash flows from operating activities less (i) purchases of property and equipment and (ii) payments for property and equipment under finance leases. Free cash flows are not intended to be an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, but rather to provide additional visibility to investors regarding how much cash is generated for discretionary and non-discretionary items after deducting purchases of property and equipment and payments for property and equipment under finance leases. Free cash flow information presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. A reconciliation of reported and expected GAAP cash flows from operating activities to the comparable non-GAAP free cash flow measure is provided in the accompanying tables.

remain at recently prevailing rates. 2 Amounts for the first quarter and full fiscal 2025 outlook exclude (i) transaction costs in connection with the acquisition of rag & bone, (ii) the amortization of the debt discount related to the 2028 Notes and (iii) the dilutive impact of the Notes for adjusted diluted shares and corresponding interest expenses at initial stock prices below $46.88 for the 2024 Notes and $41.80 for the 2028 Notes, based on the bond hedge contracts in place that will deliver shares to offset dilution. The Company excludes the impact anticipated to be recorded and the diluted impact anticipated in those periods as such amounts are reasonably estimated. The Company has not assumed any potential share dilution due to the related warrants. 3 The adjusted results exclude certain professional service and legal fees and related (credits) costs, transaction costs in connection with the acquisition of rag & bone, asset impairment charges, net (gains) losses on lease modifications, loss on extinguishment of debt, amortization of debt discount, fair value remeasurement of derivatives, the related income tax impacts of these adjustments, as well as certain discrete income tax adjustments, where applicable. The weighted average diluted shares outstanding used for adjusted diluted EPS excludes the dilutive impact of the Notes, based on the bond hedge contracts in place. A reconciliation of actual results to adjusted results is presented in the “Reconciliation of GAAP Results to Adjusted Results.” 4 The Company excludes the dilutive impact of the Notes at stock prices below $44.15 for the 2024 Notes and below $41.37 for the 2028 Notes, based on the bond hedge contracts in place that will deliver shares to offset dilution. At stock prices in excess of $44.15 for the 2024 Notes and $41.37 for the 2028 Notes, the Company would have an obligation to deliver additional shares in excess of the dilution protection provided by the bond hedges. 5 Adjustments represent certain professional service and legal fees and related (credits) costs which the Company otherwise would not have incurred as part of its business operations. Amounts include a net benefit of approximately $16.6 million recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 as a result of the settlement of the Company’s previously-disclosed stockholder derivative lawsuit brought by the Employees Retirement System of Rhode Island. 6 Adjustments represent transaction costs in connection with the acquisition of rag & bone which the Company otherwise would not have incurred as part of its business operations. 7 Adjustments represent asset impairment charges related primarily to impairment of property and equipment related to certain retail locations resulting from under-performance and expected store closures. 8 Adjustments represent net (gains) losses on lease modifications related primarily to the early termination of certain lease agreements. 9 Adjustments represent loss on extinguishment of debt from a portion of the exchanged 2024 Notes in April 2023 and January 2024. 10 In April 2023 and January 2024, the Company issued $275 million and $65 million principal amount of 3.75% convertible senior notes due 2028 in private offerings, respectively. The debt discount resulted from: (1) the modification accounting for a portion of the exchanged 2024 Notes in April 2023, and (2) recognized embedded derivative liability for the issuance of Additional 2028 Notes in January 2024. The debt discount will be amortized as non-cash interest expense over the term of the 2028 Notes. 11 Adjustments represent changes in fair value of the equity-linked derivatives associated with the 2028 Notes. 12 Adjustments represent discrete income tax items related primarily to a benefit recognized during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 related to the consolidation of certain business functions into Switzerland and, to a lesser extent, adjustments from an intra-entity transfer of intellectual property rights from certain U.S. entities to a wholly-owned Swiss subsidiary and the impact from changes in the income tax law in certain tax jurisdictions. 13 The income tax effect of certain professional service and legal fees and related (credits) costs, transaction costs in connection with the acquisition of rag & bone, asset impairment charges, net (gains) losses on lease modifications, loss on extinguishment of debt, amortization of debt discount and fair value remeasurement of derivatives was based on the Company’s assessment of deductibility using the statutory income tax rate (inclusive of the impact of valuation allowances) of the tax jurisdiction in which the charges were incurred. 14 Adjustments include the related income tax effect based on the Company’s assessment of deductibility using the statutory income tax rate (inclusive of the impact of valuation allowances) of the tax jurisdiction in which the charges were incurred.

The solution aims to minimize data misalignment, product delays, and risks by leveraging Systech's expertise. Key benefits include compliance with regulations, avoidance of supply chain delays, and enhanced efficiency. Positive None. Negative None. Supply Chain Management Expert The introduction of Systech's rework offering is a significant development in the pharmaceutical supply chain management landscape. This solution is poised to streamline the exception management process, which is a critical aspect of supply chain optimization. By reducing data misalignment and product delays, manufacturers and distributors can expect to see improved operational efficiencies and reduced costs associated with downtime and manual error correction.Moreover, the ability to quickly comply with regulations such as the Drug Quality and Security Act is a key competitive advantage. This compliance is not just a legal requirement but also serves as a trust signal to customers and partners. The integration of Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) checker is particularly noteworthy, as it enhances data verification processes and can lead to a reduction in the time required for data reconciliation, further improving supply chain velocity.However, the effectiveness of this solution will largely depend on its adoption rate and the ability to integrate seamlessly with existing systems. The promise of rapid deployment and seamless connectivity to any Level 4 platform is encouraging, but real-world implementation can face challenges. It will be important for Systech to support clients through this transition to ensure that the benefits of their solution are fully realized. Pharmaceutical Compliance Analyst The pharmaceutical industry is under constant scrutiny to maintain high standards of product quality and patient safety. In this context, Systech's new rework offering could be a game-changer for companies looking to enhance their compliance posture. The built-in data inspector tool and automated notifications to trading partners and regulatory authorities are critical features that can help in maintaining stringent compliance standards.Efficient exception handling is not just a matter of regulatory compliance but also impacts the company's reputation and bottom line. Delays in the supply chain can lead to drug shortages, which can have serious implications for patient care and can damage the trust that consumers and healthcare providers place in pharmaceutical brands.It's important to note that the pharmaceutical sector is highly regulated and any new solution must be rigorously tested to ensure it meets all necessary guidelines. The long-term benefits of adopting such a solution include potential reductions in the risk of regulatory fines and enhanced market positioning as a leader in quality assurance and patient safety. Healthcare Technology Analyst From a technological standpoint, Systech's rework solution represents an advancement in the digitization of the pharmaceutical supply chain. The emphasis on a full-stack solution that offers cloud-based tools for rework processes signifies a shift towards more agile and scalable supply chain management systems.The ability to adapt to any workflow and ecosystem is particularly important in the healthcare sector, where there is a diverse range of products and complex logistics involved. Mobile flexibility and multi-scan capabilities are likely to be highly beneficial in environments where time and accuracy are of the essence, such as in the handling of life-saving drugs.While the technology appears promising, the true test will be in its interoperability with other systems and the actual performance under the high-stakes conditions of the pharmaceutical industry. The impact on production efficiency and the mitigation of risks will be critical metrics to watch as this solution is adopted. 03/20/2024 - 04:15 PM DOWNERS GROVE, Ill., March 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Systech, part of Markem-Imaje and Dover and a leading provider of digital identification and traceability software solutions, today announced that it has released a comprehensive and versatile rework offering for managing exceptions in the pharmaceutical supply chain.

However, adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly in Q4 2023.","Chewy Announces Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Chewy, Inc. (CHWY) reported positive financial results for fiscal Q4 2023 and full year 2023, with net sales increasing, gross margin expanding, and adjusted earnings per share rising year over year. However, adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly in Q4 2023. Positive Net sales for Chewy in fiscal Q4 2023 were $2.83 billion, a 4.2% increase year over year. Gross margin expanded to 28.2% in Q4 2023, up 10 basis points compared to the previous year. Net income for Q4 2023 was $31.9 million, with a net margin of 1.1%, up 80 basis points year over year. Adjusted net income for Q4 2023 was $80.3 million, an increase of $10.0 million year over year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for Q4 2023 were $0.18, up $0.02 from the previous year. For fiscal year 2023, Chewy reported net sales of $11.15 billion, a 10.2% increase year over year. Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2023 was $368.1 million, an increase of $61.3 million compared to the previous year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2023 were $0.69, up $0.16 from the previous year. Negative Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $6.2 million in Q4 2023 compared to the previous year. Net margin contracted by 10 basis points in fiscal year 2023 compared to the previous year. Basic and diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.03 in fiscal year 2023 compared to the previous year. Financial Analyst The fiscal report from Chewy, Inc. indicates a modest growth in net sales, with a 4.2% increase in the fourth quarter and a 10.2% rise for the full year. This growth, although not exceptional, suggests a steady demand in the pet industry sector, which has seen resilience during economic fluctuations. The gross margin expansion, albeit slight, hints at improved cost management. However, investors may need to consider the contraction in the adjusted EBITDA margin, which could reflect increasing operational costs or investments that are not directly translating into proportional earnings growth.Looking at the net income and earnings per share (EPS), there is a notable increase year over year, yet the decrease in EPS from the full-year perspective could raise concerns about the company's ability to maintain profitability growth. Additionally, the inclusion of share-based compensation expenses in the report is a common practice, but it can also mask the true cash-generating ability of the company. Investors should consider the underlying cash flows and the potential impact of these non-cash expenses on the company's valuation. Market Research Analyst Chewy's market share gains, as mentioned by the CEO, are indicative of its competitive positioning within the pet care industry. The pet industry has been growing consistently, driven by trends such as humanization of pets and increased spending on pet care. Chewy's focus on expanding margins and accelerating free cash flow generation is important for sustaining its growth and financing future expansions or investments. Free cash flow is a vital indicator of a company's financial health and its ability to operate without the need for external financing.The company's commitment to further margin expansion in 2024 could be a response to the need for operational efficiency and profitability in a competitive online retail environment. The emphasis on generating meaningful free cash flow also suggests a strategic focus on long-term financial stability rather than short-term earnings, which may be appealing to shareholders looking for sustainable growth. E-commerce Specialist Chewy's performance must be contextualized within the broader e-commerce landscape, which has been marked by increased competition and rising customer acquisition costs. The company's ability to grow net sales and expand gross margin in this environment is a positive sign of its operational effectiveness and appeal to pet owners. However, the e-commerce sector is known for thin margins and Chewy's net margin of 1.1% reflects this reality.The company's strategic focus on margin expansion is particularly relevant as e-commerce players continue to face pressure from rising logistics costs and potential shifts in consumer spending habits. Chewy's success in this area will likely depend on its ability to leverage technology, manage supply chains efficiently and enhance customer experience to foster loyalty and repeat purchases. The adjusted net income and EPS growth are indicators that Chewy is navigating these challenges with some degree of success, but it will be important to monitor how these figures evolve in the face of industry-wide pressures. 03/20/2024 - 04:15 PM PLANTATION, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Chewy, Inc.

We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this communication primarily on our current assumptions, expectations, and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

While we believe that such information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, this information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed in this earnings release adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income excluding depreciation and amortization; share-based compensation expense and related taxes; income tax provision; interest income (expense), net; transaction related costs; changes in the fair value of equity warrants; severance and exit costs; and litigation matters and other items that we do not consider representative of our underlying operations. We have provided a reconciliation below of adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We have included adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin in this earnings release because each is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin facilitates operating performance comparability across reporting periods by removing the effect of non-cash expenses and certain variable charges. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. We believe it is useful to exclude non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expense from our adjusted EBITDA because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. We believe it is useful to exclude income tax provision; interest income (expense), net; transaction related costs; changes in the fair value of equity warrants; and litigation matters and other items which are not components of our core business operations. We believe it is useful to exclude severance and exit costs because these expenses represent temporary initiatives to realign resources and enhance operational efficiency, which are not components of our core business operations. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditures; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect share-based compensation and related taxes. Share-based compensation has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest income (expense), net; or changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect transaction related costs and other items which are either not representative of our underlying operations or are incremental costs that result from an actual or planned transaction or initiative and include changes in the fair value of equity warrants, severance and exit costs, litigation matters, integration consulting fees, internal salaries and wages (to the extent the individuals are assigned full-time to integration and transformation activities) and certain costs related to integrating and converging IT systems; and other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income, net margin, and our other GAAP results. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA, as well as the calculation of net margin and adjusted EBITDA margin, for each of the periods indicated.

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed in this earnings release adjusted net income and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share, which represent non-GAAP financial measures. We calculate adjusted net income as net income excluding share-based compensation expense and related taxes, changes in the fair value of equity warrants, and severance and exit costs. We calculate adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share by dividing adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average shares outstanding during the period. We have provided a reconciliation below of adjusted net income to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We have included adjusted net income and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share in this earnings release because each is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted net income and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share facilitates operating performance comparability across reporting periods by removing the effect of non-cash expenses and certain variable gains and losses that do not represent a component of our core business operations. We believe it is useful to exclude non-cash share-based compensation expense because the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations. We believe it is useful to exclude changes in the fair value of equity warrants because the variability of equity warrant gains and losses is not representative of our underlying operations. We believe it is useful to exclude severance and exit costs because these expenses represent temporary initiatives to realign resources and enhance operational efficiency, which are not components of our core business operations. Accordingly, we believe that these measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Adjusted net income and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share have limitations as financial measures and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate adjusted net income and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, you should consider adjusted net income and adjusted basic and diluted earnings alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income, basic and diluted earnings per share, and our other GAAP results.

CuriosityStream achieved a 32% year-over-year reduction in total advertising and marketing expenses in Q4 2023. The net loss for Q4 2023 was $4.7 million, a substantial improvement from the net loss of $14.5 million in Q4 2022.

The company's net loss for the full year 2023 was $48.9 million, compared to a net loss of $50.9 million in 2022.

Negative CuriosityStream's full-year revenue for 2023 decreased compared to 2022, from $78.0 million to $56.9 million.

Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2023 was $(3.4) million, showing a decline from $(13.6) million in Q4 2022. The company's net cash used in operating activities increased in Q4 2023 to $2.5 million, up from $8.8 million in Q4 2022. Financial Analyst The announcement by CuriosityStream Inc. regarding their financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, is significant for stakeholders and potential investors. The introduction of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.025 per share is a key strategic move, often seen as a signal of a company's financial health and a commitment to returning value to shareholders. The ability to pay dividends generally indicates a stable cash flow position, which in this case, is further supported by the company's statement of having excess cash to cover the dividend payments.While the reported net loss of $48.9 million for the full year may raise concerns, it is important to note the year-over-year reduction in net loss and the substantial decrease in net cash used in operating activities from $39.5 million in 2022 to $16.2 million in 2023. This improvement in cash flow management, coupled with a 40% reduction in total advertising, marketing and general and administrative expenses, reflects a strategic shift towards cost optimization and operational efficiency.However, the decline in annual revenue from $78.0 million in 2022 to $56.9 million in 2023 warrants attention, as it may indicate challenges in revenue generation or market competition. Investors should closely monitor the company's future revenue guidance and strategies for growth, particularly in light of the evolving digital entertainment landscape. Market Research Analyst The factual entertainment sector, where CuriosityStream operates, is increasingly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. The company's focus on premiering multiple original series and specials is an attempt to differentiate its content offering and drive subscriber growth. The strategy to expand into underserved areas such as crime, aviation, automotive and core genres like history, science and tech is indicative of CuriosityStream's commitment to diversifying its content library to cater to niche audiences.Moreover, the launch of annual promotional stunts is a marketing tactic aimed at increasing subscriber engagement and retention. These initiatives could potentially lead to an increase in subscriber base and, consequently, revenue. However, the effectiveness of these strategies should be evaluated against the backdrop of the company's reduced marketing and advertising expenses. It is important to assess whether these cost reductions will impact the company's ability to attract and retain subscribers in a highly saturated market. Media Industry Analyst CuriosityStream's decision to initiate a dividend program coincides with a period where many digital streaming services are reassessing their growth strategies in favor of profitability and cash flow. The positive outlook for cash flow in 2024, as indicated by the company, suggests confidence in their business model and future revenue streams. This is particularly noteworthy given the impairment charge of $19.0 million related to content assets, which could be seen as a move to align the company's content valuation with market realities.The company's focus on adjusting its cost base and achieving sequential adjusted free cash flow improvement for five straight quarters demonstrates a disciplined approach to financial management. However, the industry is marked by rapid changes in consumer preferences and technology, which requires continuous investment in content and platform innovation. Balancing cost control with the need for investment will be critical for CuriosityStream's sustained growth and market competitiveness. 03/20/2024 - 04:15 PM SILVER SPRING, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CuriosityStream Inc.

Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Generally, statements that are not historical facts, including statements concerning possible or assumed future actions, business strategies, events or results of operations, are forward-looking statements. These statements may be preceded by, followed by or include the words “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “plans,” “scheduled,” “anticipates,” “predicts” or “intends” or similar expressions. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. Certain of these risks are identified and discussed under “Risk Factors” in CuriosityStream’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, that we expect to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on or about March 22, 2024, and in CuriosityStream’s other SEC filings. These risk factors are important to consider in determining future results and should be reviewed in their entirety. Forward-looking statements are based on the current belief of the management of CuriosityStream, based on currently available information, as to the outcome and timing of future events, and involve factors, risks, and uncertainties that may cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from such statements. However, there can be no assurance that the events, results or trends identified in these forward-looking statements will occur or be achieved. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and CuriosityStream is not under any obligation, and expressly disclaims any obligation to update, alter or otherwise revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Readers should carefully review the statements set forth in the reports that CuriosityStream has filed or will file from time to time with the SEC. In addition to factors previously disclosed in CuriosityStream’s reports filed with the SEC and those identified elsewhere in this communication, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance: (i) risks related to CuriosityStream’s ability to maintain and develop new and existing revenue-generating relationships and partnerships or to significantly increase CuriosityStream's subscriber base and retain customers; (ii) the effects of pending and future legislation; (iii) risks of the internet, online commerce and media industry; (iv) the highly competitive nature of the internet, online commerce and media industry and CuriosityStream’s ability to compete therein; (v) litigation, complaints, and/or adverse publicity; (vi) the ability to meet Nasdaq’s listing standards; and (vii) privacy and data protection laws, privacy or data breaches, or the loss of data. Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our unaudited consolidated statement of operations, which is prepared in accordance with GAAP, we present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow in this press release. Our use of non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, has limitations as an analytical tool, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of financial results as reported under GAAP. We use these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP for planning purposes, including in the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of our core operating results and the effectiveness of our business strategy, and in evaluating our financial performance. These measures provide consistency and comparability with past financial performance, facilitate period-to-period comparisons of core operating results, and also facilitate comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company’s operating performance. We exclude the following items from net income to calculate Adjusted EBITDA: interest and other income (expense), provision for income taxes, depreciation and non-content amortization, loss/(gain) on the change in fair value of our warrants, equity interests loss (gain), impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and content assets, restructuring charges and stock-based compensation. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is calculated as net cash flow used in operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and restructuring charges. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In particular, (1) although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges, the assets subject to depreciation and amortization may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (2) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect: (a) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; or (b) tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and (3) Adjusted Free Cash Flow does not reflect: (a) our cash flow available for discretionary payments; (b) our future contractual commitments (such as any debt service requirements or dividend payments); (c) funds available for investment or other discretionary uses; (d) certain capital expenditure requirements; or (e) the total increase or decrease in our cash balances for the stated period. The non-GAAP financial measures we use may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in the financial statements tables included in this press release and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation.

(TWO) declares a dividend of $0.45 per share for the first quarter of 2024. The company also announces preferred stock dividends for Series A, B, and C. Two Harbors is a real estate investment trust focusing on mortgage servicing rights and residential mortgage-backed securities. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of a dividend payout by Two Harbors Investment Corp. is a significant indicator of the company's financial health and its ability to generate cash flow. A dividend of $0.45 per share of common stock suggests that the company has sufficient earnings and confidence in its future earnings to return capital to shareholders. Additionally, the declaration of dividends for preferred stock, with specific rates for Series A, B and C, indicates a commitment to fulfilling obligations to preferred shareholders, who typically have fixed dividend rates.Investors often view dividend announcements as a signal of a company's stability and maturity. The impact on the stock market can be positive, as dividends can attract income-focused investors. However, it's important to analyze the payout ratio and compare it with industry standards to ensure that the dividends are sustainable and not compromising the company's growth potential or ability to invest in profitable ventures. Market Research Analyst Two Harbors' focus on mortgage servicing rights (MSR) and Agency RMBS (Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities) positions it within a sector that is sensitive to interest rate changes and housing market dynamics. The ability to pay consistent dividends may reflect not only the company's operational efficiency but also a stable housing market and favorable interest rate environment. This can reassure investors about the sector's health.However, it's essential to consider the broader economic context, including potential shifts in monetary policy that could affect mortgage rates and refinancing activity. These factors can influence the performance of MSRs and RMBS and consequently, the company's future dividend-paying capacity. Investors should view the dividend announcement in light of these macroeconomic factors to gauge the long-term sustainability of Two Harbors' investment strategy. Real Estate Investment Trust Analyst The declaration of dividends by Two Harbors Investment Corp. provides insight into the company's strategy within the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector. REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends, which can make them attractive to income-seeking investors. The specific rates declared for the preferred stock dividends reflect the fixed-income nature of these securities, which is a draw for investors seeking less volatile returns.It is important to analyze the company's portfolio diversification, its exposure to MSR and Agency RMBS and the impact of economic cycles on these assets. The company's ability to maintain or increase dividends over time is an important consideration for investors. The impact to book value and market environment mentioned in the announcement are key factors that could affect future dividend policy and should be monitored closely by stakeholders. 03/20/2024 - 04:15 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Two Harbors Investment Corp. (NYSE: TWO), an MSR + Agency RMBS real estate investment trust, today declared a dividend of $0.45 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2024. The first quarter dividend is payable on April 29, 2024 to common stockholders of record at the close of business on April 4, 2024. The common stock dividend is a function of several factors, including sustainability, earnings and return potential of the portfolio, taxable income, impact to book value and the market environment. Two Harbors also declared today the following preferred stock dividends: a dividend of $0.50781 per share of the 8.125% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock; a dividend of $0.47656 per share of the 7.625% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock; and a dividend of $0.45313 per share of the 7.25% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock.

Key highlights include FDA approval of Simlandi™ biosimilar to Humira®, launch of Jamteki™ biosimilar to Stelara®, and positive results from clinical studies for proposed biosimilars. Positive Total revenues in 2023 reached $93.4 million, up by 10% compared to the previous year. Product revenues surged to $48.7 million in 2023, a significant increase from $24.8 million in 2022. Q4 2023 product revenues stood at $18.9 million, marking a 37% growth from the same period in the previous year. Alvotech's Simlandi™ biosimilar to Humira® received FDA approval in the U.S. with interchangeable status. Sales of Jamteki™ biosimilar to Stelara® commenced in Canada, with launches planned in Japan in Q2 and Europe in Q3. Positive top-line results were announced from a confirmatory efficacy study for Alvotech's proposed biosimilar to Eylea® and PK studies for proposed biosimilars to Prolia®/Xgeva® and Simponi®/Simponi Aria®. Alvotech's commercialization partner, Teva Pharmaceuticals, secured FDA approval for AVT02, an interchangeable biosimilar to Humira, under the tradename Simlandi. AVT04, a biosimilar to Stelara, was approved in Canada and the EEA, with launches in Japan and Europe expected in Q2 and Q3 respectively. Positive results were reported from a PK study for AVT05, a biosimilar candidate to Simponi® and Simponi Aria®. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 10% increase in total revenues and a significant 96% rise in product revenues for Alvotech are strong indicators of the company's growth trajectory. The financial performance is particularly noteworthy in the context of the biotech sector, where product development and market penetration are key drivers of revenue. The substantial revenue growth from the biosimilar segment signals a successful strategy in capturing market share from originator biologics. This positions Alvotech favorably in the competitive landscape, potentially impacting its stock valuation positively.Investors should be aware of the potential for increased operational costs associated with the global launch of new products. While these costs could pressure short-term margins, the strategic expansion into new markets like Japan and Europe is likely to bolster long-term revenue streams. The exclusivity granted to Simlandi™ in the U.S. market is another pivotal factor, as it could provide a temporary competitive edge and contribute to a stronger market presence before the entry of additional competitors. Medical Research Analyst The U.S. FDA's approval of Simlandi™ as the first high-concentration biosimilar with interchangeable status is a significant milestone in the biosimilars market. This not only enhances the credibility of Alvotech's product but also simplifies pharmacy-level substitution, which could lead to increased adoption and market penetration. The clinical development milestones, including positive top-line results from efficacy and pharmacokinetic studies, support the company's robust R&D capabilities and may reduce regulatory hurdles for future product approvals.From a medical perspective, biosimilars provide a cost-effective alternative to expensive biologics, which can lead to broader healthcare access and potential savings for healthcare systems. Alvotech's focus on biosimilars like those for Eylea® and Prolia®/Xgeva® addresses significant markets with unmet needs, potentially driving further revenue growth and benefiting patients by increasing treatment options. Market Research Analyst Alvotech's strategic positioning in the biosimilar market is underscored by the recent approval and launch of its products in various global markets. The biosimilar industry is rapidly evolving and Alvotech's early entry into the space with products like Simlandi™ and Jamteki™ provides a competitive advantage. The timing of these launches is critical as it coincides with the patent expiries of reference products, allowing Alvotech to capture market share early on.The company's pipeline highlights, including the anticipated FDA approval for its biosimilar to Stelara® in the U.S., suggest a forward-thinking approach to product development and market entry strategies. The positive results from pharmacokinetic studies further indicate a promising future for the company's pipeline products, which could lead to sustained growth and diversification of revenue sources in the long term. 03/20/2024 - 04:15 PM Total Revenues in 2023 were $93.4 million, up 10% from previous yearProduct Revenues in 2023 were $48.7 million, compared to $24.8 million in 2022, with Q4 2023 product revenues of $18.9 million, up by 37% from the same period last yearAlvotech’s Simlandi™ biosimilar to Humira® (adalimumab) was approved in the U.S. as the first high-concentration biosimilar with interchangeable statusSales of Alvotech’s Jamteki™ biosimilar to Stelara® (ustekinumab) started in Canada with launches expected in Japan in Q2 and Europe in Q3Positive top-line results were announced from a confirmatory efficacy study for Alvotech’s proposed biosimilar to Eylea® (aflibercept) and PK studies for proposed biosimilars to Prolia®/Xgeva® (denosumab) and Simponi®/Simponi Aria® (golimumab) Alvotech (NASDAQ: ALVO, or the “Company”), a global biotech company specializing in the development and manufacture of biosimilar medicines for patients worldwide, today reported financial results for full year 2023 and provided a summary of recent pipeline and corporate highlights.

U.S. FDA approval of Simlandi™, our high-concentration citrate-free biosimilar to Humira® with interchangeable status and exclusivity, was another major milestone. We remain convinced that Simlandi’s product characteristics have the potential to change the dynamics of the rapidly developing U.S. adalimumab market,” said Robert Wessman, Chairman and CEO of Alvotech. “We also met several major clinical development milestones, with positive top-line results from the confirmatory efficacy study for our proposed biosimilar to Eylea® (aflibercept) and from the pharmacokinetic studies for our biosimilar candidate to Simponi® and Simponi Aria® (golimumab) as well as our biosimilar candidate to Prolia® and Xgeva® (denosumab), further illustrating the advantage of Alvotech’s portfolio strategy and integrated biosimilars development and manufacturing platform.” Recent Highlights PipelineAlvotech and its commercialization partner in the U.S., Teva Pharmaceuticals, announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved AVT02 (adalimumab-ryvk) for marketing in the U.S. an interchangeable biosimilar to Humira, under the tradename Simlandi. Simlandi is the first high-concentration, citrate-free biosimilar to Humira that has been granted interchangeability status by the FDA and will qualify for interchangeable exclusivity for the 40mg/0.4ml injection. Alvotech and its respective commercialization partners announced approval of AVT04, a biosimilar to Stelara (ustekinumab) in Canada and the European Economic Area (EEA). AVT04 was launched in Canada by JAMP Pharma on March 1, 2024, under the tradename Jamteki. Launch of AVT04 in Japan is expected in May 2024 and in Europe in Q3 2024. The market entry date for the U.S. is February 21, 2025, pending FDA approval which is expected by April 16, 2024. Alvotech announced positive top-line results from a pharmacokinetic (PK) study for AVT05, a biosimilar candidate to Simponi® and Simponi Aria® (golimumab). The study, which assessed the PK, safety and tolerability of AVT05 compared to Simponi in healthy adult subjects, met its primary endpoints. In 2023, combined worldwide revenues from sales of Simponi and Simponi Aria were about $2.2 billion [1]. Alvotech announced positive top-line results from a confirmatory study for AVT06, a proposed biosimilar to Eylea® (aflibercept). The confirmatory clinical study that compared AVT06 with Eylea in patients with neovascular (wet) Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) met its primary endpoint, with results demonstrating therapeutic equivalence with Eylea. In 2023 cumulative global sales of Eylea were about $5.9 billion [2]. Alvotech announced positive top-line results from a PK study for AVT03, a biosimilar candidate to Prolia® and Xgeva®, which both contain denosumab. The PK study met its primary endpoints. A confirmatory efficacy study for AVT03 in patients is currently underway, as well as a PK study comparing AVT03 to Xgeva® in healthy adult subjects. In 2023 cumulative global sales of Prolia and Xgeva were approximately $6.2 billion [3].CorporateAlvotech accepted an offer from a group of domestic and international investors for the sale of 10,127,132 of its ordinary shares for an approximate value of $166 million at a purchase price of $16.41 per share or ISK 2,250. Intended uses of the net proceeds are for general corporate purposes and working capital, to strengthen production capacity and to support expected biosimilars launches. Alvotech announced the appointment of Christina Siniscalchi as interim Chief Quality Officer. Christina has for over ten years served in senior quality positions for Alvogen and its manufacturing site in Norwich, NY, most recently as Alvogen’s Chief Quality Officer, and previously worked at Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals. Financial Results for Full Year 2023 Cash Position and Sources of Liquidity: As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $11.2 million, excluding $26.1 million of restricted cash. In addition, the Company had borrowings of $960.2 million, including $38.0 million of current portion of borrowings. Giving effect to the sale of 10,127,132 of Alvotech ordinary shares for an approximate gross value of $166 million, the cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $172 million on a proforma basis as of December 31, 2023. Product Revenue: Product revenue was $48.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $24.8 million for the same period in the prior year, reflecting increased sales volume in select European countries during 2023, almost doubling the product revenue from 2022. License and Other Revenue: License and other revenue decreased by $15.5 million, which is primarily attributable to the recognition of $44.5 million research and development milestone during the same period in the prior year, due to the completion of the AVT04 main clinical program. This was partially offset by the recognition of $31.6 million research and development milestone during 2023 due to the CES completion of the AVT06 program. The remainder of the decrease is principally due to the net impact of the licensing arrangements changed during the year. Cost of product revenue: Cost of product revenue was $160.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as a result of the successful launch of AVT02 in select European countries, Canada and Australia. Cost of product revenue for the period is disproportionate relative to product revenue due to the timing of new launches and elevated production-related charges, resulting in higher costs than revenues recognized for the period. The Company expects this relationship to normalize with increased production from the scaling and expansion of new or recent launches. The Company estimates that the anticipated increase in sales volumes will result in a greater absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. Prior to the recognition of cost of product revenues, costs from pre-commercial manufacturing activities were reported as R&D expenses. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses were $210.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $180.6 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by a charge of $18.5 million relating to the termination of the co-development agreement with Biosana for AVT23, and a $42.5 million increase in direct program expenses mainly from three biosimilar candidates, AVT03, AVT05 and AVT06, that entered clinical development in 2022. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $30.6 million primarily related to programs that have completed clinical phase, and non-recurrence of pre-commercial manufacturing activities. General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses: G&A expenses were $76.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $186.7 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in G&A expenses was primarily attributable to a $83.4 million non-cash share listing expense, and $22.9 million of transaction costs recognized as a result of the Business Combination, and a $13.4 million of IP-related legal expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was partially offset by a $3.7 million net increase in other general administrative expenses due to incremental costs from operating as a public company. Lastly, the Company recognized $10.8 million of G&A expenses for share-based payments, resulting from the granting of Restricted Share Units (RSUs) during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $6.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. Share of net loss of joint venture and impairment loss on investment in joint venture: The increase by $4.6 million in share of net loss of joint venture year over year is due to an increase in losses incurred by the Joint Venture during the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to December 31, 2022. In 2023, an impairment of $21.5 million was recognized on the joint venture investment based on discussions between Alvotech and CCHN to buy back Alvotech's interests in the joint venture. Finance income: Finance income was $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase is primarily driven by interest received on cash and cash equivalent held in our bank accounts. Finance costs: Finance costs amounted to $267.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $188.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase is primarily related to a $49.2 million increase in interest on debt and borrowings due to the additional financing obtained since December 31, 2022, including the annualized impact of prior year financing, and a $35.4 million increase in fair value of derivative liabilities. This is partially offset by $16.0 million in charges related to the closing of the Business Combination in 2022. Exchange rate differences: Exchange rate differences resulted in a loss of $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a gain of $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by the movements in the exchange rate of foreign currencies, predominantly Icelandic krona and euros. Income tax benefits: The income tax benefit increased by $61.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period for 2022. This increase was mainly driven by $34.7 million deferred tax credit corresponding to an increase in operating losses and a $26.7 million favorable foreign currency impact on the strengthening of the Icelandic krona against the U.S. dollar, increasing the U.S. dollar value of Icelandic tax loss carry-forwards that the Company expects to fully utilize against future taxable profits. Loss for the Period: Loss for the period was $551.7 million, or ($2.43) per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to a loss of $513.6 million, or ($2.60) per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the same period in the prior year.

The Fund's managed distribution policy aims to pay recurring monthly distributions reflecting its cash flow. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a monthly common share distribution by First Trust Energy Infrastructure Fund is a noteworthy event for current and prospective investors. A distribution rate of 6.62% based on the NAV and 6.78% based on the closing market price is significant when compared to the average dividend yield of the S&P 500, which historically hovers around 2%. This higher distribution rate could be indicative of the fund's strategy to attract income-focused investors, particularly in the context of an energy infrastructure fund where dividends are often a key component of total returns.Investors should be aware that the distribution is part of a managed distribution policy, which may include long-term capital gains. This approach can provide a more consistent income stream, but it's important to recognize that distributions are not solely from income or dividends but can also include return of capital or realized capital gains. The impact on the fund's net asset value (NAV) should be monitored, as frequent distributions can potentially erode NAV if not offset by fund performance. Tax Advisor From a taxation standpoint, the aspect of the Fund's distribution policy that includes long-term capital gains on a monthly basis is quite unusual and could influence investor's tax planning. Typically, capital gains are distributed annually and their classification as long-term can benefit from lower tax rates compared to short-term gains. By distributing these gains monthly, the Fund provides investors with a more predictable tax liability throughout the year, which can be particularly advantageous for those in higher tax brackets or for those conducting complex tax planning.However, it's essential for shareholders to understand that the tax implications of these distributions can affect their after-tax return. Investors should consult with tax professionals to understand the impact on their individual tax situation, especially since the tax treatment of these distributions can vary based on the investor's holding period and tax bracket. Market Research Analyst Assessing the Fund's managed distribution policy, it's important to consider the broader market implications. A stable and potentially attractive distribution yield may signal confidence in the Fund's ability to generate cash flow from its underlying energy infrastructure investments. Given the volatile nature of energy markets, this can be reassuring to investors looking for regular income.However, it's also critical to evaluate the sustainability of such distributions. If the distributions are supported by actual income and profits from investments, this bodes well for the long-term stability of the Fund. On the other hand, if distributions are significantly funded by return of capital or are not fully covered by income, this could be a red flag indicating that the Fund's yield may not be sustainable in the long run.Investors should also consider how the Fund's distribution policy fits within the current interest rate environment and the overall energy sector performance. In a rising interest rate environment, high distribution rates might become less attractive if safer assets start offering competitive yields. 03/20/2024 - 04:10 PM WHEATON, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- First Trust Energy Infrastructure Fund (the ""Fund"") (NYSE: FIF) has declared the Fund’s regularly scheduled monthly common share distribution in the amount of $0.10 per share payable on April 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of April 2, 2024. The ex-dividend date is expected to be April 1, 2024. The monthly distribution information for the Fund appears below. First Trust Energy Infrastructure Fund (FIF): Distribution per share: $0.10 Distribution Rate based on the March 19, 2024 NAV of $18.14: 6.62% Distribution Rate based on the March 19, 2024 closing market price of $17.69: 6.78% The Fund's Board of Trustees has approved a managed distribution policy for the Fund (the ""Plan"") in reliance on exemptive relief received from the Securities and Exchange Commission which permits the Fund to make periodic distributions of long-term capital gains as frequently as monthly each tax year. Under the Plan, the Fund intends to continue to pay a recurring monthly distribution that reflects the distributable cash flow of the Fund. A portion of this monthly distribution may include long-term capital gains. This may result in a reduction of the long-term capital gain distribution necessary at year end by distributing long-term capital gains throughout the year. The annual distribution rate is independent of the Fund's performance during any particular period. Accordingly, you should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of any distribution or from the terms of the Plan. This distribution will consist of net investment income earned by the Fund and return of capital and may also consist of net short-term realized capital gains. The final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in 2024 will be made after the end of 2024 and will be provided on Form 1099-DIV. The Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that seeks to provide a high level of total return with an emphasis on current distributions paid to shareholders. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing primarily in securities of companies engaged in the energy infrastructure sector. These companies principally include publicly-traded MLPs and limited liability companies taxed as partnerships, MLP affiliates, YieldCos, pipeline companies, utilities, and other companies that derive at least 50% of their revenues from operating or providing services in support of infrastructure assets such as pipelines, power transmission and petroleum and natural gas storage in the petroleum, natural gas and power generation industries (collectively, ""Energy Infrastructure Companies""). To generate additional income, the Fund expects to write (or sell) covered call options on up to 35% of the managed assets held in the Fund's portfolio. First Trust Advisors L.P. (""FTA"") is a federally registered investment advisor and serves as the Fund's investment advisor. FTA and its affiliate First Trust Portfolios L.P. (""FTP""), a FINRA registered broker-dealer, are privately-held companies that provide a variety of investment services. FTA has collective assets under management or supervision of approximately $218 billion as of February 29, 2024 through unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, mutual funds and separate managed accounts. FTA is the supervisor of the First Trust unit investment trusts, while FTP is the sponsor. FTP is also a distributor of mutual fund shares and exchange-traded fund creation units. FTA and FTP are based in Wheaton, Illinois. Energy Income Partners, LLC (""EIP"") serves as the Fund's investment sub-advisor and provides advisory services to a number of investment companies and partnerships for the purpose of investing in MLPs and other energy infrastructure securities. EIP is one of the early investment advisors specializing in this area. As of February 29, 2024, EIP managed or supervised approximately $5.1 billion in client assets.

Investments held by the Fund are subject to market fluctuations caused by real or perceived adverse economic conditions, political events, regulatory factors or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, market manipulation, government defaults, government shutdowns, regulatory actions, political changes, diplomatic developments, the imposition of sanctions and other similar measures, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Current market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates and expect to continue to do so, and the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to reverse previously implemented quantitative easing. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects. The Fund is subject to risks, including the fact that it is a non-diversified closed-end management investment company. Because the Fund is concentrated in securities issued by energy infrastructure companies, it will be more susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting that industry, including high interest costs, high leverage costs, the effects of economic slowdown, surplus capacity, increased competition, uncertainties concerning the availability of fuel at reasonable prices, the effects of energy conservation policies and other factors. Investments in securities of MLPs involve certain risks different from or in addition to the risks of investing in common stocks. The number of energy-related MLPs has declined since 2014. The industry is witnessing the consolidation or simplification of corporate structures where the MLP sleeve of capital is being eliminated. As a result of the foregoing, the Fund's MLP investments could become less diverse and the Fund may increase its non-MLP investments consistent with its investment objective and policies. Changes in tax laws or regulations, or interpretations thereof in the future, could adversely affect the Fund or the MLPs, MLP-related entities and other energy sector and energy utility companies in which the Fund invests. The Fund invests in securities of non-U.S. issuers which are subject to higher volatility than securities of U.S. issuers. Because the Fund invests in non-U.S. securities, you may lose money if the local currency of a non-U.S. market depreciates against the U.S. dollar. There can be no assurance as to what portion of the distributions paid to the Fund's Common Shareholders will consist of tax-advantaged qualified dividend income. To the extent a fund invests in floating or variable rate obligations that use the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") as a reference interest rate, it is subject to LIBOR Risk. LIBOR has ceased to be made available as a reference rate and there is no assurance that any alternative reference rate, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR""), will be similar to or produce the same value or economic equivalence as LIBOR. The unavailability or replacement of LIBOR may affect the value, liquidity or return on certain fund investments and may result in costs incurred in connection with closing out positions and entering into new trades. Any potential effects of the transition away from LIBOR on a fund or on certain instruments in which a fund invests is difficult to predict and could result in losses to the fund. As the writer (seller) of a call option, the Fund forgoes, during the life of the option, the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the portfolio security covering the option above the sum of the premium and the strike price of the call option but retains the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security decline. The value of call options written by the Fund may be adversely affected if the market for the option is reduced or becomes illiquid. There can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist when the Fund seeks to close out an option position. If short-term interest rates are lower than the Fund's fixed rate of payment on an interest rate swap, the swap will reduce common share net earnings. In addition, a default by the counterparty to a swap transaction could also negatively impact the performance of the common shares. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses.

The ex-dividend date is expected to be April 1, 2024. The monthly distribution information for the Fund appears below. First Trust High Yield Opportunities 2027 Term Fund (FTHY): Distribution per share: $0.13 Distribution Rate based on the March 19, 2024 NAV of $15.63: 9.98% Distribution Rate based on the March 19, 2024 closing market price of $14.32: 10.89% This distribution will consist of net investment income earned by the Fund and return of capital and may also consist of net short-term realized capital gains. The final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in 2024 will be made after the end of 2024 and will be provided on Form 1099-DIV. The Fund has a practice of seeking to maintain a relatively stable monthly distribution which may be changed periodically. First Trust Advisors L.P. (""FTA"") believes the practice may benefit the Fund's market price and premium/discount to the Fund's NAV. The practice has no impact on the Fund's investment strategy and may reduce the Fund's NAV. The Fund is a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is to provide current income. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will seek to achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its managed assets in high yield debt securities of any maturity that are rated below investment grade at the time of purchase or unrated securities determined by First Trust Advisors L.P. (""FTA"") to be of comparable quality. High yield debt securities include U.S. and non-U.S. corporate debt obligations and senior, secured floating rate loans (""Senior Loans""). Securities rated below investment grade are commonly referred to as ""junk"" or ""high yield"" securities and are considered speculative with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective or that the Fund's investment strategies will be successful. First Trust Advisors L.P. (""FTA"") is a federally registered investment advisor and serves as the Fund's investment advisor. FTA and its affiliate First Trust Portfolios L.P. (""FTP""), a FINRA registered broker-dealer, are privately-held companies that provide a variety of investment services. FTA has collective assets under management or supervision of approximately $218 billion as of February 29, 2024 through unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, mutual funds and separate managed accounts. FTA is the supervisor of the First Trust unit investment trusts, while FTP is the sponsor. FTP is also a distributor of mutual fund shares and exchange-traded fund creation units. FTA and FTP are based in Wheaton, Illinois. Principal Risk Factors: Risks are inherent in all investing. Certain risks applicable to the Fund are identified below, which includes the risk that you could lose some or all of your investment in the Fund. The principal risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the Fund's annual shareholder reports. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund also files reports, proxy statements and other information that is available for review. Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. Market risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Investments held by the Fund are subject to market fluctuations caused by real or perceived adverse economic conditions, political events, regulatory factors or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, market manipulation, government defaults, government shutdowns, regulatory actions, political changes, diplomatic developments, the imposition of sanctions and other similar measures, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Current market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates and expect to continue to do so, and the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to reverse previously implemented quantitative easing. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects. The Fund will typically invest in securities rated below investment grade, which are commonly referred to as ""junk"" or ""high yield"" securities and considered speculative because of the credit risk of their issuers. Such issuers are more likely than investment grade issuers to default on their payments of interest and principal owed to the Fund, and such defaults could reduce the Fund's NAV and income distributions. An economic downturn would generally lead to a higher non-payment rate, and a high yield security may lose significant market value before a default occurs. Moreover, any specific collateral used to secure a high yield security may decline in value or become illiquid, which would adversely affect the high yield security's value. The debt securities in which the Fund invests are subject to certain risks, including issuer risk, reinvestment risk, prepayment risk, credit risk, and interest rate risk. Issuer risk is the risk that the value of fixed-income securities may decline for a number of reasons which directly relate to the issuer. Reinvestment risk is the risk that income from the Fund's portfolio will decline if the Fund invests the proceeds from matured, traded or called bonds at market interest rates that are below the Fund portfolio's current earnings rate. Prepayment risk is the risk that, upon a prepayment, the actual outstanding debt on which the Fund derives interest income will be reduced. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result. Interest rate risk is the risk that fixed-income securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates. Senior Loans are structured as floating rate instruments in which the interest rate payable on the obligation fluctuates with interest rate changes. As a result, the yield on Senior Loans will generally decline in a falling interest rate environment, causing the Fund to experience a reduction in the income it receives from a Senior Loan. In addition, the market value of Senior Loans may fall in a declining interest rate environment and may also fall in a rising interest rate environment if there is a lag between the rise in interest rates and the reset. Many Senior Loans have a minimum base rate, or floor, which will be used if the actual base rate is below the minimum base rate. To the extent the Fund invests in such Senior Loans, the Fund may not benefit from higher coupon payments during periods of increasing interest rates as it otherwise would from investments in Senior Loans without any floors until rates rise to levels above the floors. As a result, the Fund may lose some of the benefits of incurring leverage. Specifically, if the Fund's borrowings have floating dividend or interest rates, its costs of leverage will increase as rates increase. In this situation, the Fund will experience increased financing costs without the benefit of receiving higher income. This in turn may result in the potential for a decrease in the level of income available for dividends or distributions to be made by the Fund. The senior loan market has seen a significant increase in loans with weaker lender protections including, but not limited to, limited financial maintenance covenants or, in some cases, no financial maintenance covenants (i.e., ""covenant-lite loans"") that would typically be included in a traditional loan agreement and general weakening of other restrictive covenants applicable to the borrower such as limitations on incurrence of additional debt, restrictions on payments of junior debt or restrictions on dividends and distributions. Weaker lender protections such as the absence of financial maintenance covenants in a loan agreement and the inclusion of ""borrower-favorable"" terms may impact recovery values and/or trading levels of senior loans in the future. The absence of financial maintenance covenants in a loan agreement generally means that the lender may not be able to declare a default if financial performance deteriorates. This may hinder the Fund's ability to reprice credit risk associated with a particular borrower and reduce the Fund's ability to restructure a problematic loan and mitigate potential loss. As a result, the Fund's exposure to losses on investments in senior loans may be increased, especially during a downturn in the credit cycle or changes in market or economic conditions. To the extent a fund invests in floating or variable rate obligations that use the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") as a reference interest rate, it is subject to LIBOR Risk. LIBOR has ceased to be made available as a reference rate and there is no assurance that any alternative reference rate, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR""), will be similar to or produce the same value or economic equivalence as LIBOR. The unavailability or replacement of LIBOR may affect the value, liquidity or return on certain fund investments and may result in costs incurred in connection with closing out positions and entering into new trades. Any potential effects of the transition away from LIBOR on a fund or on certain instruments in which a fund invests is difficult to predict and could result in losses to the fund. A second lien loan may have a claim on the same collateral pool as the first lien or it may be secured by a separate set of assets. Second lien loans are typically secured by a second priority security interest or lien on specified collateral securing the borrower's obligation under the interest and present a greater degree of investment risk. These loans are also subject to the risk that borrower cash flow and property securing the loan may be insufficient to meet scheduled payments after giving effect to those loans with a higher priority. These loans also have greater price volatility than those loans with a higher priority and may be less liquid. However, second lien loans often pay interest at higher rates than first lien loans reflecting such additional risks. The Fund intends to terminate on or about August 1, 2027. Because the assets of the Fund will be liquidated in connection with the termination, the Fund may be required to sell portfolio securities when it otherwise would not, including at times when market conditions are not favorable, which may cause the Fund to lose money. The Fund is not a ""target term"" Fund and its primary objective is to provide high current income. As a result, the Fund may not return the Fund's initial public offering price of $20.00 per share at its termination. Investing in securities of non-U.S. issuers, which are generally denominated in non-U.S. currencies, may involve certain risks not typically associated with investing in securities of U.S. issuers, including but not limited to economic risks, political risks, and currency risks. Investing in emerging market countries, as compared to foreign developed markets, involves substantial additional risk due to more limited information about the issuer and/or the security (including limited financial and accounting information); higher brokerage costs; different accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards; less developed legal systems and thinner trading markets; the possibility of currency blockages or transfer restrictions; an emerging market country's dependence on revenue from particular commodities or international aid; and the risk of expropriation, nationalization or other adverse political or economic developments. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses. The Fund's portfolio is subject to credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, prepayment risk and reinvestment risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that fixed-income securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result. Credit risk may be heightened for the Fund because it invests in below investment grade securities. Liquidity risk is the risk that the fund may have difficulty disposing of senior loans if it seeks to repay debt, pay dividends or expenses, or take advantage of a new investment opportunity. Prepayment risk is the risk that, upon a prepayment, the actual outstanding debt on which the Fund derives interest income will be reduced. The Fund may not be able to reinvest the proceeds received on terms as favorable as the prepaid loan. Reinvestment risk is the risk that income from the Fund's portfolio will decline if the Fund invests the proceeds from matured, traded or called instruments at market interest rates that are below the Fund's portfolio's current earnings rate.

Book value per share increased by 14% year over year to $51.14. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent financial results from KB Home indicate a robust beginning to fiscal 2024, marked by a 6% increase in revenues and a significant 21% rise in diluted earnings per share. The uptick in net orders by 55% and the corresponding net order value by 58% signal strong demand in the housing market. These figures are particularly noteworthy given the backdrop of a challenging economic environment in previous years, where the housing sector faced headwinds from rising interest rates and economic uncertainty.From a financial perspective, the company's strategic share repurchases have contributed to earnings per share growth, a tactic often used to signal confidence in future prospects and to return value to shareholders. However, the slight decrease in the homebuilding operating income margin and housing gross profit margin, even when excluding inventory-related charges, suggests that there may be cost pressures or pricing dynamics at play that could affect profitability if they persist.The balance sheet reflects a healthy liquidity position, with significant cash and cash equivalents and available credit. The debt to capital ratio improvement is a positive sign, indicating a more robust capital structure that could potentially withstand market volatility. The guidance for the full year 2024 suggests management's optimism about the company's performance, with expected increases in housing revenues and a stable operating income margin. Market Research Analyst KB Home's performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 provides insights into broader market trends. The increase in net orders and value highlights a recovering demand in the housing market, which may be driven by a combination of improved economic conditions and a shift in consumer preferences post-pandemic. The higher volume of interest rate locks and loan originations, facilitated by the company's mortgage banking joint venture, underscores a conducive financing environment that is supportive of home purchases.However, the reduction in average selling price and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of housing revenues could indicate a strategic shift towards more affordable housing units and an investment in marketing to support community growth. This aligns with a broader industry trend towards diversification of product offerings to meet a wider range of buyer needs. The company's focus on expanding community count is a forward-looking strategy that could cater to future housing demands but requires careful monitoring of market absorption rates to avoid overextension. Real Estate Economist The reported financial outcomes from KB Home suggest that the housing market is experiencing a phase of expansion, reflecting broader economic recovery signals. The substantial growth in net orders points to increased consumer confidence and a potential rebound in housing demand. However, the slight decline in the average selling price juxtaposed with increased costs highlights a competitive pricing environment, which could squeeze margins if costs continue to escalate without corresponding price adjustments.The strategic land acquisitions, as evidenced by the 60% increase in investments in land and land development, suggest that KB Home is bullish on the long-term prospects of the housing market. This land banking strategy could provide a competitive advantage in terms of future community development and inventory management. Nevertheless, the reduction in ending backlog value could be an early indicator of demand fluctuations or pricing pressures that need to be closely monitored. 03/20/2024 - 04:10 PM Revenues Grew 6% to $1.47 Billion; Diluted Earnings Per Share Increased 21% to $1.76 Net Orders Up 55%; Net Order Value Increased 58% to $1.58 Billion Repurchased $50 Million of Common Stock LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- KB Home (NYSE: KBH) today reported results for its first quarter ended February 29, 2024. ""Fiscal 2024 is off to a strong start, as we generated solid results in our first quarter that were either at or above the high end of our guidance ranges. Market conditions have improved since the end of our 2023 fiscal year, contributing to the significant year‐over‐year increase in our net orders for the quarter,” said Jeffrey Mezger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “This positive momentum in demand has continued in our 2024 second quarter to date, and we believe we are well‐positioned to capitalize on it given our commitment to offering all homebuyers the ability to personalize their home, our well-designed products and attractive price points, as well as our expanding community count.” “With a healthy balance sheet and strong cash flow, we continue to prioritize investing in land acquisition and development, as well as returning capital to our stockholders. In the 2024 first quarter, we increased our investments in land and land development and continued to repurchase our common stock. While positioning the Company for growth, we also intend to make additional share repurchases in 2024, as we remain focused on creating long‐term stockholder value,” concluded Mezger. Three Months Ended February 29, 2024 (comparisons on a year-over-year basis) Revenues up 6% to $1.47 billion. Homes delivered increased 9% to 3,037. Average selling price was $480,100, compared to $494,500. Homebuilding operating income totaled $157.7 million, up slightly from $156.5 million. The homebuilding operating income margin was 10.8%, compared to 11.4%. Excluding total inventory-related charges of $1.3 million for the current quarter and $5.3 million for the year-earlier quarter, the homebuilding operating income margin was 10.9%, compared to 11.7%. The housing gross profit margin of 21.5% was even with the year-earlier quarter. Excluding the above-mentioned inventory-related charges, the housing gross profit margin was 21.6%, compared to 21.8%. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of housing revenues were 10.8%, compared to 10.1%, mainly reflecting higher costs including marketing, advertising and other expenses associated with the planned increase in our community count during the year as we position our operations for growth. Financial services pretax income rose to $11.6 million from $6.0 million, primarily due to increased equity in income of the Company’s mortgage banking joint venture. This was largely driven by a higher volume of both interest rate locks and loan originations, as more homes were delivered in the current period and 85% of the buyers financing their home purchases used the joint venture, up from 79%. Net income increased 10% to $138.7 million. Diluted earnings per share grew 21% to $1.76, reflecting the favorable impact of the Company’s common stock repurchases over the past several quarters. The effective tax rate was 20.6%, compared to 22.6%, largely due to an increase in tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in the current period. Backlog and Net Orders (comparisons on a year-over-year basis, except as noted) Net orders grew 55% to 3,323 due to improved demand and a lower cancellation rate as compared to the year-earlier quarter. Net order value rose 58% to $1.58 billion, reflecting the growth in net orders and a higher average selling price of those orders. Monthly net orders per community increased to 4.6 from 2.8. Gross orders were up 15% to 3,873, and the cancellation rate as a percentage of gross orders improved to 14%, compared to 36%. The number of homes in the Company’s ending backlog totaled 5,796, compared to 7,016. Ending backlog value was $2.79 billion, compared to $3.31 billion. Ending backlog homes and value each increased 5% from the previous quarter. The Company’s average community count was down 4% to 240, and ending community count decreased 7% to 238. On a sequential basis, the average community count expanded 2%. Balance Sheet as of February 29, 2024 (comparisons to November 30, 2023, except as noted) The Company had total liquidity of $1.75 billion, including $668.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.08 billion of available capacity under its unsecured revolving credit facility, with no cash borrowings outstanding. Inventories totaled $5.24 billion, up 2%. The Company’s total investments in land and land development of $587.1 million increased 60% from the year-earlier quarter. The Company’s lots owned or under contract totaled 55,509, of which approximately 72% were owned and 28% were under contract. Notes payable of $1.69 billion were essentially unchanged. The Company’s debt to capital ratio improved 30 basis points to 30.4%, compared to 30.7%. On a year-over-year basis, the debt to capital ratio improved 220 basis points from 32.6%. Stockholders’ equity increased to $3.88 billion, compared to $3.81 billion, mainly reflecting net income, partly offset by common stock repurchases and cash dividends. In the 2024 first quarter, the Company repurchased 826,663 shares of its outstanding common stock at a total cost of $50.0 million. As of February 29, 2024, the Company had $113.6 million remaining under its current common stock repurchase authorization. Based on the Company’s 75.9 million outstanding shares as of February 29, 2024, book value per share of $51.14 increased 14% year over year. Guidance The Company is providing the following guidance for its 2024 full year: Housing revenues in the range of $6.50 billion to $6.90 billion. Average selling price in the range of $480,000 to $490,000. Homebuilding operating income as a percentage of revenues in the range of 10.9% to 11.3%, assuming no inventory-related charges. Housing gross profit margin in the range of 21.0% to 21.4%, assuming no inventory-related charges.

The Company believes this non-GAAP financial measure is relevant and useful to investors in understanding its operations, and may be helpful in comparing the Company with other companies in the homebuilding industry to the extent they provide similar information. However, because it is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, this non-GAAP financial measure may not be completely comparable to other companies in the homebuilding industry and, thus, should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating performance and/or financial measures prescribed by GAAP. Rather, this non-GAAP financial measure should be used to supplement the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in order to provide a greater understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company’s operations. Adjusted Housing Gross Profit Margin The following table reconciles the Company’s housing gross profit margin calculated in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measure of the Company’s adjusted housing gross profit margin: Three Months Ended February 29, 2024 February 28, 2023 Housing revenues $ 1,458,126 $ 1,378,537 Housing construction and land costs (1,144,427 ) (1,082,821 ) Housing gross profits 313,699 295,716 Add: Inventory-related charges (a) 1,298 5,289 Adjusted housing gross profits $ 314,997 $ 301,005 Housing gross profit margin 21.5 % 21.5 % Adjusted housing gross profit margin 21.6 % 21.8 % (a) Represents inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges associated with housing operations. Adjusted housing gross profit margin is a non-GAAP financial measure, which the Company calculates by dividing housing revenues less housing construction and land costs excluding housing inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges (as applicable) recorded during a given period, by housing revenues. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is housing gross profit margin. The Company believes adjusted housing gross profit margin is a relevant and useful financial measure to investors in evaluating the Company’s performance as it measures the gross profits the Company generated specifically on the homes delivered during a given period. This non-GAAP financial measure isolates the impact that housing inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges have on housing gross profit margins, and allows investors to make comparisons with the Company’s competitors that adjust housing gross profit margins in a similar manner. The Company also believes investors will find adjusted housing gross profit margin relevant and useful because it represents a profitability measure that may be compared to a prior period without regard to variability of housing inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges. This financial measure assists management in making strategic decisions regarding community location and product mix, product pricing and construction pace.

Principal Risk Factors: Risks are inherent in all investing. Certain risks applicable to the Fund are identified below, which includes the risk that you could lose some or all of your investment in the Fund. The principal risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the Fund's annual shareholder reports. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund also files reports, proxy statements and other information that is available for review. Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. Market risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Investments held by the Fund are subject to market fluctuations caused by real or perceived adverse economic conditions, political events, regulatory factors or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, market manipulation, government defaults, government shutdowns, regulatory actions, political changes, diplomatic developments, the imposition of sanctions and other similar measures, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Current market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates and expect to continue to do so, and the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to reverse previously implemented quantitative easing. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects. The Fund invests in securities of non-U.S. issuers which are subject to higher volatility than securities of U.S. issuers. The Fund may invest from time to time a substantial amount of its assets in issuers located in a single country or region. Risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in, or with significant operations in, emerging market countries. Because the Fund invests in non-U.S. securities, you may lose money if the local currency of a non-U.S. market depreciates against the U.S. dollar. The Fund invests in non-investment grade debt instruments, commonly referred to as ""high-yield securities"". High-yield securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings. Lower-quality debt tends to be less liquid than higher-quality debt. The debt securities in which the Fund invests are subject to certain risks, including issuer risk, reinvestment risk, prepayment risk, credit risk, and interest rate risk. Issuer risk is the risk that the value of fixed-income securities may decline for a number of reasons which directly relate to the issuer. Reinvestment risk is the risk that income from the Fund's portfolio will decline if the Fund invests the proceeds from matured, traded or called bonds at market interest rates that are below the Fund portfolio's current earnings rate. Prepayment risk is the risk that, upon a prepayment, the actual outstanding debt on which the Fund derives interest income will be reduced. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result. Interest rate risk is the risk that fixed-income securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates. Investments in securities of issuers located in emerging market countries are considered speculative and there is a heightened risk of investing in emerging markets securities. Financial and other reporting by companies and government entities also may be less reliable in emerging market countries. Shareholder claims that are available in the U.S., as well as regulatory oversight and authority that is common in the U.S., including for claims based on fraud, may be difficult or impossible for shareholders of securities in emerging market countries or for U.S. authorities to pursue. The ability of a government issuer, especially in an emerging market country, to make timely and complete payments on its debt obligations will be strongly influenced by the government issuer's balance of payments, including export performance, its access to international credits and investments, fluctuations of interest rates and the extent of its foreign reserves. Forward foreign currency exchange contracts involve certain risks, including the risk of failure of the counterparty to perform its obligations under the contract and the risk that the use of forward contracts may not serve as a complete hedge because of an imperfect correlation between movements in the prices of the contracts and the prices of the currencies hedged. To the extent a fund invests in floating or variable rate obligations that use the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") as a reference interest rate, it is subject to LIBOR Risk. LIBOR has ceased to be made available as a reference rate and there is no assurance that any alternative reference rate, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR""), will be similar to or produce the same value or economic equivalence as LIBOR. The unavailability or replacement of LIBOR may affect the value, liquidity or return on certain fund investments and may result in costs incurred in connection with closing out positions and entering into new trades. Any potential effects of the transition away from LIBOR on a fund or on certain instruments in which a fund invests is difficult to predict and could result in losses to the fund. Political or economic disruptions in European countries, even in countries in which a fund is not invested, may adversely affect security values and thus the fund's holdings. A significant number of countries in Europe are member states in the European Union, and the member states no longer control their own monetary policies. In these member states, the authority to direct monetary policies, including money supply and official interest rates for the Euro, is exercised by the European Central Bank. The implications of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union are difficult to gauge and cannot yet be fully known. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses.

The partnership aims to leverage GasLog's liquid hydrogen vessel and Chart's cryogenics expertise for global LH2 distribution. CEO Paolo Enoizi and President Jill Evanko express enthusiasm for the collaboration. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst Exploring the collaboration between Chart Industries and GasLog LNG Services Ltd. in developing a liquid hydrogen (LH2) supply chain is a testament to the evolving energy landscape. As the global economy leans towards cleaner energy sources, this partnership signifies a strategic pivot for both companies and could have a ripple effect on the energy sector.Chart Industries brings over a century of experience in hydrogen technologies, which is critical given the complex nature of LH2 handling and distribution. Their expertise in cryogenics will be pivotal in ensuring the safe and efficient transport of LH2. GasLog's move from focusing on LNG to LH2 indicates a diversification strategy that aligns with global decarbonization goals.For investors, this indicates potential new revenue streams and a stronger foothold in the clean energy market for both companies. It's also a sign that the industry is betting on hydrogen as a key component of the energy mix, which could lead to increased investment in related infrastructure and technologies. Environmental Policy Expert The shift to LH2 from traditional fossil fuels could have significant environmental implications. Hydrogen is often touted as a zero-emission fuel when produced from renewable sources and its adoption can substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions.However, the environmental impact of LH2 supply chains will depend on the methods used for hydrogen production. If the hydrogen is produced using green methods, such as electrolysis powered by renewable energy, the benefits are maximized. Conversely, if it's derived from natural gas via steam methane reforming without carbon capture, the environmental benefits are less clear.The policy landscape will likely evolve to support such clean energy initiatives, potentially through subsidies or regulations that favor low-carbon technologies. This could enhance the viability and scalability of LH2 projects and drive broader industry adoption. Supply Chain Management Expert Developing a commercial scale LH2 supply chain is a complex endeavor that requires innovation in logistics and supply chain management. Chart Industries and GasLog's collaboration will need to address challenges such as specialized storage, transportation safety and maintaining LH2 at extremely low temperatures.The transition from discussions around ammonia to LH2 supply chains illustrates a strategic shift in focus to more efficient energy carriers. LH2 has a higher energy density than ammonia, which could mean more efficient storage and transport, albeit with increased technical challenges.The successful implementation of such a supply chain could set a precedent for future energy transportation, potentially creating a blueprint for other companies to follow. It's an indicator of innovation within the supply chain sector, which could lead to improved processes and standards across the industry. 03/20/2024 - 04:15 PM ATLANTA, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chart Industries, Inc.

Certain risks applicable to the Fund are identified below, which includes the risk that you could lose some or all of your investment in the Fund. The principal risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the Fund's annual shareholder reports. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund also files reports, proxy statements and other information that is available for review. Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. Market risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Investments held by the Fund are subject to market fluctuations caused by real or perceived adverse economic conditions, political events, regulatory factors or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, market manipulation, government defaults, government shutdowns, regulatory actions, political changes, diplomatic developments, the imposition of sanctions and other similar measures, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Current market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates and expect to continue to do so, and the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to reverse previously implemented quantitative easing. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects. The Fund invests in non-investment grade debt instruments, commonly referred to as ""high-yield securities"". High-yield securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings. Lower-quality debt tends to be less liquid than higher-quality debt. The debt securities in which the Fund invests are subject to certain risks, including issuer risk, reinvestment risk, prepayment risk, credit risk, and interest rate risk. Issuer risk is the risk that the value of fixed-income securities may decline for a number of reasons which directly relate to the issuer. Reinvestment risk is the risk that income from the Fund's portfolio will decline if the Fund invests the proceeds from matured, traded or called bonds at market interest rates that are below the Fund portfolio's current earnings rate. Prepayment risk is the risk that, upon a prepayment, the actual outstanding debt on which the Fund derives interest income will be reduced. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result. Interest rate risk is the risk that fixed-income securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates. In times of unusual or adverse market, economic, regulatory or political conditions, the Fund may not be able, fully or partially, to implement its short selling strategy. Short selling creates special risks which could result in increased volatility of returns and may result in greater gains or greater losses. The Fund invests in securities of non-U.S. issuers which are subject to higher volatility than securities of U.S. issuers. Because the Fund invests in non-U.S. securities, you may lose money if the local currency of a non-U.S. market depreciates against the U.S. dollar. Investments in securities of issuers located in emerging market countries are considered speculative and there is a heightened risk of investing in emerging markets securities.

Any potential effects of the transition away from LIBOR on a fund or on certain instruments in which a fund invests is difficult to predict and could result in losses to the fund. Forward foreign currency exchange contracts involve certain risks, including the risk of failure of the counterparty to perform its obligations under the contract and the risk that the use of forward contracts may not serve as a complete hedge because of an imperfect correlation between movements in the prices of the contracts and the prices of the currencies hedged. Distressed securities frequently do not produce income while they are outstanding. The Fund may be required to incur certain extraordinary expenses in order to protect and recover its investment. The Fund also will be subject to significant uncertainty as to when and in what manner and for what value the obligations evidenced by the distressed securities will eventually be satisfied. Illiquid and restricted securities may be difficult to dispose of at a fair price at the times when the Fund believes it is desirable to do so. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses.

A mortgage-backed security may be negatively affected by the quality of the mortgages underlying such security and the structure of its issuer. For example, if a mortgage underlying a particular mortgage-backed security defaults, the value of that security may decrease. Moreover, a downturn in the markets for residential or commercial real estate or a general economic downturn could negatively affect both the price and liquidity of privately issued mortgage-backed securities. A portion of the Fund's managed assets may be invested in subordinated classes of mortgage-backed securities. Such subordinated classes are subject to a greater degree of non-payment risk than are senior classes of the same issuer or agency. To the extent a fund invests in floating or variable rate obligations that use the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") as a reference interest rate, it is subject to LIBOR Risk. LIBOR has ceased to be made available as a reference rate and there is no assurance that any alternative reference rate, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR""), will be similar to or produce the same value or economic equivalence as LIBOR. The unavailability or replacement of LIBOR may affect the value, liquidity or return on certain fund investments and may result in costs incurred in connection with closing out positions and entering into new trades. Any potential effects of the transition away from LIBOR on a fund or on certain instruments in which a fund invests is difficult to predict and could result in losses to the fund. Investments in asset-backed or mortgage-backed securities offered by non-governmental issuers, such as commercial banks, savings and loans, private mortgage insurance companies, mortgage bankers and other secondary market issuers are subject to additional risks. The primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts are (a) the imperfect correlation between the change in market value of the instruments or indices underlying the futures contracts and the price of the futures contracts; (b) possible lack of a liquid secondary market for a futures contract and the resulting inability to close a futures contract when desired; (c) losses caused by unanticipated market movements, which are potentially unlimited; (d) the investment adviser's inability to predict correctly the direction of securities prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates and other economic factors; and (e) the possibility that the counterparty will default in the performance of its obligations. If a security sold short increases in price, the Fund may have to cover its short position at a higher price than the short sale price, resulting in a loss. Repurchase agreements are subject to the risk of failure. If the Fund's counterparty defaults on its obligations and the Fund is delayed or prevented from recovering the collateral, or if the value of the collateral is insufficient, the Fund may realize a loss. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses. The risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the shareholder reports and other regulatory filings.

The company aims to repurchase shares through various means until December 31, 2024, considering trading windows, market conditions, and legal requirements. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The authorization of a new $10 million share repurchase plan by Heritage Insurance Holdings represents a strategic financial maneuver that can have a multifaceted impact on the company's financial health and its stock valuation. Share buybacks are often perceived as a signal of management's confidence in the company's prospects and can lead to an immediate uptick in stock price due to the reduced number of shares outstanding, which in turn increases earnings per share (EPS).However, the decision to prioritize share repurchases must be weighed against other potential uses of cash, such as debt reduction, expansion, or investment in new technologies. The company's reference to debt covenant restrictions and alternative investment opportunities suggests a careful consideration of its capital allocation strategy. Investors should assess the long-term benefits of such buybacks, particularly in the context of the company's operational performance and growth potential. A repurchase plan amidst strong performance can bolster investor sentiment, while the same action during a downturn may raise concerns about the company's growth avenues and cash flow management. Market Research Analyst Heritage Insurance Holdings' decision to initiate another share repurchase plan after the expiration of its prior one indicates a consistent approach to shareholder value enhancement. From a market perspective, this move can be interpreted as a positive signal to the market, potentially attracting institutional investors who look favorably upon buyback activities. It's important to monitor the market response following this announcement, as it can offer insights into the market's perception of the company's valuation and its management's decision-making.Furthermore, the timing and volume of share repurchases can also provide an indication of the company's liquidity management. The company's mention of purchasing shares based on available liquidity and business conditions suggests a flexible approach, which can be reassuring to investors concerned about over-leveraging or misallocation of resources. Legal Expert In the context of share repurchase plans, it is essential to consider the legal implications and compliance with federal securities laws. Heritage Insurance Holdings' commitment to conducting repurchases in accordance with these laws indicates a diligent legal strategy to avoid potential pitfalls associated with insider trading regulations and market manipulation. The company's adherence to trading windows and legal requirements can also be seen as a commitment to transparency and fair dealing, which can enhance its reputation among investors and regulators alike.Investors should be aware of the legal framework governing share repurchases, as non-compliance can lead to serious legal consequences and can negatively impact the company's market standing and investor trust. A company's proactive approach to legal compliance in its repurchase plan can serve as a risk mitigator in an investor's portfolio. 03/20/2024 - 04:07 PM TAMPA, Fla., March 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Heritage Insurance Holdings, Inc.

The ex-dividend date is expected to be April 1, 2024. The monthly distribution information for the Fund appears below. First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (FCT): Distribution per share: $0.097 Distribution Rate based on the March 19, 2024 NAV of $11.09: 10.50% Distribution Rate based on the March 19, 2024 closing market price of $10.29: 11.31% This distribution will consist of net investment income earned by the Fund and return of capital and may also consist of net short-term realized capital gains. The final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in 2024 will be made after the end of 2024 and will be provided on Form 1099-DIV. The Fund has a practice of seeking to maintain a relatively stable monthly distribution which may be changed periodically. First Trust Advisors L.P. (""FTA"") believes the practice may benefit the Fund's market price and premium/discount to the Fund's NAV. The practice has no impact on the Fund's investment strategy and may reduce the Fund's NAV. The Fund is a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The Fund pursues these investment objectives by investing primarily in senior secured floating-rate corporate loans. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its Managed Assets in lower grade debt instruments. First Trust Advisors L.P. (""FTA"") is a federally registered investment advisor and serves as the Fund's investment advisor. FTA and its affiliate First Trust Portfolios L.P. (""FTP""), a FINRA registered broker-dealer, are privately-held companies that provide a variety of investment services. FTA has collective assets under management or supervision of approximately $218 billion as of February 29, 2024 through unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, mutual funds and separate managed accounts. FTA is the supervisor of the First Trust unit investment trusts, while FTP is the sponsor. FTP is also a distributor of mutual fund shares and exchange-traded fund creation units. FTA and FTP are based in Wheaton, Illinois. Principal Risk Factors: Risks are inherent in all investing. Certain risks applicable to the Fund are identified below, which includes the risk that you could lose some or all of your investment in the Fund. The principal risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the Fund's annual shareholder reports. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund also files reports, proxy statements and other information that is available for review. Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. Market risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Investments held by the Fund are subject to market fluctuations caused by real or perceived adverse economic conditions, political events, regulatory factors or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, market manipulation, government defaults, government shutdowns, regulatory actions, political changes, diplomatic developments, the imposition of sanctions and other similar measures, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Current market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates and expect to continue to do so, and the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to reverse previously implemented quantitative easing. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects. The Fund will typically invest in senior loans rated below investment grade, which are commonly referred to as ""junk"" or ""high-yield"" securities and considered speculative because of the credit risk of their issuers. Such issuers are more likely than investment grade issuers to default on their payments of interest and principal owed to the Fund, and such defaults could reduce the Fund's NAV and income distributions. An economic downturn would generally lead to a higher non-payment rate, and a senior loan may lose significant market value before a default occurs. Moreover, any specific collateral used to secure a senior loan may decline in value or become illiquid, which would adversely affect the senior loan's value. The senior loan market has seen an increase in loans with weaker lender protections which may impact recovery values and/or trading levels in the future. The absence of financial maintenance covenants in a loan agreement generally means that the lender may not be able to declare a default if financial performance deteriorates. This may hinder the Fund's ability to reprice credit risk associated with a particular borrower and reduce the Fund's ability to restructure a problematic loan and mitigate potential loss. As a result, the Fund's exposure to losses on investments in senior loans may be increased, especially during a downturn in the credit cycle or changes in market or economic conditions. To the extent a fund invests in floating or variable rate obligations that use the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") as a reference interest rate, it is subject to LIBOR Risk. LIBOR has ceased to be made available as a reference rate and there is no assurance that any alternative reference rate, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR""), will be similar to or produce the same value or economic equivalence as LIBOR. The unavailability or replacement of LIBOR may affect the value, liquidity or return on certain fund investments and may result in costs incurred in connection with closing out positions and entering into new trades. Any potential effects of the transition away from LIBOR on a fund or on certain instruments in which a fund invests is difficult to predict and could result in losses to the fund. A second lien loan may have a claim on the same collateral pool as the first lien or it may be secured by a separate set of assets. Second lien loans are typically secured by a second priority security interest or lien on specified collateral securing the Borrower's obligation under the interest. Because second lien loans are second to first lien loans, they present a greater degree of investment risk. Specifically, these loans are subject to the additional risk that the cash flow of the Borrower and property securing the loan may be insufficient to meet scheduled payments after giving effect to those loans with a higher priority. In addition, loans that have a lower than first lien priority on collateral of the Borrower generally have greater price volatility than those loans with a higher priority and may be less liquid. In the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or principal payments on a senior loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a reduction in its income and a decline in the value of the senior loan, which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value of the Fund's common shares. If the Fund acquires a senior loan from another lender, for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject to credit risks with respect to that lender. Although senior loans may be secured by specific collateral, the value of the collateral may not equal the Fund's investment when the senior loan is acquired or may decline below the principal amount of the senior loan subsequent to the Fund's investment. Also, to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the borrower or its subsidiaries or affiliates, the Fund bears the risk that the stock may decline in value, be relatively illiquid, and/or may lose all or substantially all of its value, causing the senior loan to be under collateralized. Therefore, the liquidation of the collateral underlying a senior loan may not satisfy the issuer's obligation to the Fund in the event of non-payment of scheduled interest or principal, and the collateral may not be readily liquidated. Distressed securities frequently do not produce income while they are outstanding. The Fund may be required to incur certain extraordinary expenses in order to protect and recover its investment. The Fund also will be subject to significant uncertainty as to when and in what manner and for what value the obligations evidenced by the distressed securities will eventually be satisfied. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses. The Fund's portfolio is also subject to credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, prepayment risk and reinvestment risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that fixed-income securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result. Credit risk may be heightened for the Fund because it invests in below investment grade securities. Liquidity risk is the risk that the fund may have difficulty disposing of senior loans if it seeks to repay debt, pay dividends or expenses, or take advantage of a new investment opportunity. Prepayment risk is the risk that, upon a prepayment, the actual outstanding debt on which the Fund derives interest income will be reduced. The Fund may not be able to reinvest the proceeds received on terms as favorable as the prepaid loan. Reinvestment risk is the risk that income from the Fund's portfolio will decline if the Fund invests the proceeds from matured, traded or called instruments at market interest rates that are below the Fund's portfolio's current earnings rate. The risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the shareholder reports and other regulatory filings.

The company's operating cash flow was $1.22 billion, showcasing profitability and growth. Micron's CEO, Sanjay Mehrotra, highlighted the team's exceptional performance and the company's leading position in the semiconductor industry, driven by AI opportunities. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent financial results from Micron Technology indicate a significant rebound in the company's profitability, attributed largely to the increased demand for AI-related semiconductor products. The reported revenue of $5.82 billion marks a substantial improvement from both the previous quarter and the same period last year, suggesting a strong recovery trajectory. This uptick in revenue, coupled with a positive GAAP net income of $793 million, reflects a robust turnaround in operations.From an investment standpoint, the positive earnings per share (EPS) figures and the company's optimistic guidance for the upcoming quarter could signal confidence to investors. The declaration of a quarterly dividend, albeit modest, further reinforces the message of financial stability and shareholder value. However, the reported negative adjusted free cash flows raise questions about the company's capital expenditure strategy and its sustainability in the long term. Market Research Analyst Micron's performance must be contextualized within the broader semiconductor industry, which is currently experiencing a surge in demand due to the proliferation of AI technologies. Micron's emphasis on their 'preeminent product portfolio' suggests that the company is strategically positioned to capitalize on this trend. However, it is essential to monitor market competition and the potential for supply chain constraints that could impact future profitability.Investors should also consider the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, where periods of tight supply and high demand can be followed by oversupply and price declines. Micron's forward-looking statements indicate anticipation of continued growth, but market dynamics can shift rapidly, affecting future performance. Semiconductor Industry Analyst Understanding the nuances of Micron's financial health requires an examination of the gross margin improvement, which has risen from a negative percentage in the previous year to 18.5% this quarter. This metric is essential as it reflects the efficiency of the company's production process and its ability to control costs relative to sales. The projected increase in gross margin for the next quarter could indicate further operational improvements or pricing power in the market.Additionally, the capital expenditures of $1.25 billion, despite resulting in negative free cash flow, highlight Micron's commitment to investing in its technological capabilities to meet the growing demand for AI applications. This strategic allocation of resources is likely to be a critical factor in maintaining competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving industry. 03/20/2024 - 04:06 PM AI demand and tight supply accelerate return to profitabilityBOISE, Idaho, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Micron Technology, Inc.

The impact of inventory NRV write-downs for each period reflects (1) inventory write-downs in that period, offset by (2) lower costs in that period on the sale of inventory written down in prior periods.

With our improved fiscal 2024 outlook, we can now estimate a more reliable annual effective tax rate and have reverted to a global annual effective tax rate method. The second fiscal quarter tax benefit arises from applying this estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date results.

A portion of this benefit is included in our non-GAAP net income, with a larger benefit in our GAAP net income. The divergence between the GAAP and non-GAAP amounts of this tax benefit relates to the difference in our GAAP and non-GAAP estimated annual effective tax rates, which are computed separately.

The non-GAAP adjustments above may or may not be infrequent or nonrecurring in nature, but are a result of periodic or non-core operating activities. We believe this non-GAAP information is helpful in understanding trends and in analyzing our operating results and earnings. We are providing this information to investors to assist in performing analysis of our operating results. When evaluating performance and making decisions on how to allocate our resources, management uses this non-GAAP information and believes investors should have access to similar data when making their investment decisions. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures increase transparency by providing investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enabling enhanced comparison of our operating results between periods and with peer companies. The presentation of these adjusted amounts varies from amounts presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to amounts reported by other companies. Our management excludes the following items in analyzing our operating results and understanding trends in our earnings: Stock-based compensation;Gains and losses from settlements;Restructure and asset impairments; andThe estimated tax effects of above, non-cash changes in net deferred income taxes, assessments of tax exposures, certain tax matters related to prior fiscal periods, and significant changes in tax law.

The Fund has a practice of seeking to maintain a relatively stable monthly distribution which may be changed periodically. First Trust Advisors L.P.

Principal Risk Factors: Risks are inherent in all investing. Certain risks applicable to the Fund are identified below, which includes the risk that you could lose some or all of your investment in the Fund. The principal risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the Fund's annual shareholder reports. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund also files reports, proxy statements and other information that is available for review. Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. Market risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Investments held by the Fund are subject to market fluctuations caused by real or perceived adverse economic conditions, political events, regulatory factors or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, market manipulation, government defaults, government shutdowns, regulatory actions, political changes, diplomatic developments, the imposition of sanctions and other similar measures, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Current market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates and expect to continue to do so, and the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to reverse previously implemented quantitative easing. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects. Preferred/hybrid and debt securities in which the Fund invests are subject to various risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and call risk. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result. Credit risk may be heightened for the Fund because it invests in below investment grade securities, which involve greater risks than investment grade securities, including the possibility of dividend or interest deferral, default or bankruptcy. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of fixed-rate securities in the Fund will decline because of rising market interest rates. Call risk is the risk that performance could be adversely impacted if an issuer calls higher-yielding debt instruments held by the Fund. These securities are also subject to issuer risk, floating rate and fixed-to-floating rate risk, prepayment risk, reinvestment risk, subordination risk and liquidity risk. The risks associated with trust preferred securities typically include the financial condition of the financial institution that creates the trust, as the trust typically has no business operations other than holding the subordinated debt issued by the financial institution and issuing the trust preferred securities and common stock backed by the subordinated debt Interest rate risk is the risk that securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates. The duration of a security will be expected to change over time with changes in market factors and time to maturity. Although the Fund seeks to maintain a duration, under normal market circumstances, excluding the effects of leverage, of between three and eight years, if the effect of the Fund's use of leverage was included in calculating duration, it could result in a longer duration for the Fund. Because the Fund is concentrated in the financials sector, it will be more susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting this sector, such as changes in interest rates, loan concentration and competition. Investment in non-U.S. securities is subject to the risk of currency fluctuations and to economic and political risks associated with such foreign countries. Investments in securities of issuers located in emerging market countries are considered speculative and there is a heightened risk of investing in emerging markets securities. Financial and other reporting by companies and government entities also may be less reliable in emerging market countries. Shareholder claims that are available in the U.S., as well as regulatory oversight and authority that is common in the U.S., including for claims based on fraud, may be difficult or impossible for shareholders of securities in emerging market countries or for U.S. authorities to pursue. To the extent a fund invests in floating or variable rate obligations that use the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") as a reference interest rate, it is subject to LIBOR Risk. LIBOR has ceased to be made available as a reference rate and there is no assurance that any alternative reference rate, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR""), will be similar to or produce the same value or economic equivalence as LIBOR. The unavailability or replacement of LIBOR may affect the value, liquidity or return on certain fund investments and may result in costs incurred in connection with closing out positions and entering into new trades. Any potential effects of the transition away from LIBOR on a fund or on certain instruments in which a fund invests is difficult to predict and could result in losses to the fund. Contingent Capital Securities provide for mandatory conversion into common stock of the issuer under certain circumstances, which may limit the potential for income and capital appreciation and, under certain circumstances, may result in complete loss of the value of the investment. Reverse repurchase agreements involve leverage risk, the risk that the purchaser fails to return the securities as agreed upon, files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent. The Fund may be restricted from taking normal portfolio actions during such time, could be subject to loss to the extent that the proceeds of the agreement are less than the value of securities subject to the agreement and may experience adverse tax consequences. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses. The risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the shareholder reports and other regulatory filings.

The company plans to actively monitor its stock price and explore options to meet the requirement. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The extension granted to Oblong, Inc. by Nasdaq to meet the minimum bid price requirement represents a critical juncture for the company. From a market analyst perspective, the implications of this development are multifaceted. Firstly, the extension provides a window of opportunity for Oblong to implement strategic initiatives aimed at bolstering investor confidence and elevating stock prices. This could involve operational improvements, cost management, or new product launches.However, the potential for delisting remains a significant risk. Delisting typically leads to reduced liquidity, limited investor access and a potential decline in share value. Investors must monitor the company's performance closely, considering both the short-term efforts to increase the bid price and the long-term viability of the company's business model. The pressure to perform within the extended timeframe could also induce volatility in the company's stock price as the deadline approaches. Financial Analyst As a financial analyst, examining Oblong's financial health is pivotal in assessing the likelihood of the company regaining compliance with the Nasdaq's Bid Price Rule. The company's future financial statements will be scrutinized for revenue growth, expense control and cash flow management. These indicators will provide insight into the company's operational efficiency and its ability to attract investment.Investors should also be aware of any financial restructuring or equity financing that the company might undertake to improve its stock price. Such actions can dilute current shareholders but may be necessary to meet Nasdaq's requirements. It's important to evaluate the company's financial strategies in the context of its industry and competitive landscape, as these will influence its ability to sustain improvements in stock performance. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the notification from Nasdaq outlines a clear regulatory framework that Oblong must navigate. The conditions set forth for regaining compliance are legally binding and failure to meet them could result in delisting. It is essential for the company to understand the legal ramifications of delisting, including the procedural aspects of appealing to a hearings panel.Investors should be cognizant of the legal disclosures and risk factors communicated by the company in relation to this extension. The company's adherence to the Nasdaq Listing Rules and the transparency of its communications regarding compliance efforts will be key in maintaining shareholder trust during this period. 03/20/2024 - 04:10 PM DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Oblong, Inc.

If at any time prior to September 16, 2024, the bid price of the Company's Common Stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, the Company will regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. If the Company does not regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule during the additional 180-day extension, Nasdaq will provide written notification to the Company that its Common Stock will be delisted. At that time, the Company may appeal the relevant delisting determination to a hearings panel pursuant to the procedures set forth in the applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules.

(AVGR) announces a strategic partnership with Zylox-Tonbridge, securing up to $15 million in funding for U.S. growth initiatives and coronary product development. The partnership also opens doors for sales in Asia. Fourth-quarter revenue reaches $1.9 million with a 5% sequential increase, while the gross margin stands at 20%. Expansion of sales team and commercial launch of Tigereye ST and Pantheris LV devices highlight the company's progress. Avinger's President and CEO, Jeff Soinski, expresses enthusiasm for the partnership and outlines strategic benefits for global sales and revenue growth. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The strategic financing and partnership agreement between Avinger, Inc. and Zylox-Tonbridge is a significant development that could have a material impact on Avinger's financials and growth trajectory. The $7.5 million initial equity investment provides immediate capital that can be allocated towards U.S. growth initiatives and coronary product development. This influx of funds may improve the company's balance sheet and potentially reduce the need for future debt or dilutive equity financing.Furthermore, the partnership with Zylox-Tonbridge, a key player in the Chinese market, could facilitate Avinger's entry into Asia, a region with a large and growing demand for medical devices. This could diversify Avinger's revenue streams and increase its total addressable market. However, investors should monitor the execution of this expansion, as entering a new market entails regulatory, cultural and operational challenges that can affect the anticipated growth and profitability.The reported revenue growth and gross margin reflect modest improvements, but the gross margin remains relatively low at 20%. Investors should look for improvements in gross margin as an indicator of operational efficiency and cost management, especially as the company scales up production with potentially more cost-efficient manufacturing structures through the partnership. Medical Device Market Analyst The expansion of Avinger's sales team and the deepening of its market presence in the Midwest, Texas and Florida are important for capturing a larger share of the U.S. market. The medical device industry is highly competitive and sales force effectiveness is often a key differentiator. A larger sales team can enhance physician engagement and increase the adoption rate of new products like the Tigereye ST and Pantheris LV devices.Moreover, the development of a proprietary image-guided coronary CTO-crossing system positions Avinger at the forefront of vascular intervention technology. The successful completion of Phase 2 design selection and studies, with an IDE submission on the horizon, signals progress towards expanding their product line. If the coronary CTO-crossing system receives regulatory approval, it could significantly boost Avinger's competitive edge and market share in a specialized segment of the market, assuming the product demonstrates efficacy and safety.However, the success of these initiatives will depend on several factors, including the rate of clinical adoption, reimbursement rates and the ability to maintain product quality while scaling up. Investors should evaluate the potential increase in R&D and marketing expenses against the expected revenue from new product launches and market expansion. Healthcare Industry Strategist The strategic partnership with Zylox-Tonbridge not only provides Avinger with capital and market access but also presents an opportunity for operational synergies. Access to high-quality peripheral products from Zylox-Tonbridge could enhance Avinger's product portfolio in the U.S. and Germany without significant R&D investment. This could lead to incremental revenue growth and improved sales productivity.However, partnerships and expansions of this nature come with risks, such as dependency on the partner's performance and potential integration issues. The ability of Avinger to leverage this partnership effectively will be critical to realizing the projected benefits. Stakeholders should consider the long-term implications of this strategic move, including potential cultural and logistical challenges of managing a cross-continental partnership and the impact on Avinger's core competency in intravascular image-guided systems.Overall, the collaboration with Zylox-Tonbridge could be transformative for Avinger, provided the company navigates the complexities of international expansion and integration with its existing operations. Continuous monitoring of the partnership's progress and its impact on Avinger's financials and market position will be important for stakeholders. 03/20/2024 - 04:05 PM New Strategic Partnership Provides Funding to Support U.S. Growth Initiatives and Coronary Product Development, Opens New Pathway for Sales in AsiaREDWOOD CITY, CA / ACCESSWIRE / March 20, 2024 / Avinger, Inc. (Nasdaq:AVGR), a commercial-stage medical device company developing and marketing the first and only intravascular image-guided, catheter-based systems for diagnosis and treatment of vascular disease, today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.Fourth Quarter and Recent HighlightsAnnounced up to $15 million strategic financing and partnership agreement with Zylox-Tonbridge, a leading provider of neuro- and peripheral-vascular interventional solutions in China, with $7.5 million initial equity investment funded in March 2024Reported fourth quarter 2023 revenue of $1.9 million, a sequential increase of 5%, and gross margin of 20%Expanded sales team by more than 25% and deepened Avinger's presence in key Midwest, Texas and Florida marketsExpanded full commercial launch of Tigereye ST, Avinger's most advanced image-guided peripheral CTO-crossing device, based on strong momentum in the fourth quarterContinued limited launch of the new Pantheris LV (large vessel) image-guided atherectomy device in anticipation of full commercial launchAdvanced development of proprietary image-guided coronary CTO-crossing system, including completion of Phase 2 design selection and multiple rounds of animal and cadaver heart studies, with IDE submission anticipated in the third quarter of 2024""We are excited to begin our strategic partnership with Zylox-Tonbridge, a dynamic leader in the peripheral interventional market in China,"" said Jeff Soinski, Avinger's President and CEO. ""Not only does this partnership provide strategic equity funding to support our growth initiatives in the U.S. market and advance development of our first coronary product, it also opens a proven commercial channel for Avinger products to enter the robust and growing Greater China market. The strategic relationship provides the opportunity for Avinger to partner with Zylox-Tonbridge to develop a more cost-efficient manufacturing structure to support the growth of global sales and improve gross margin. It also allows Avinger to access certain of Zylox-Tonbridge's high-quality peripheral products for distribution in the U.S. and Germany, providing the opportunity for incremental revenue growth and increased sales productivity without significant R&D investment.""Across our existing commercial portfolio, commercial launch activity for the Tigereye ST CTO-crossing catheter is showing exciting momentum in the marketplace, and we intend to build on this success with the full commercial launch of our Pantheris LV image-guided atherectomy system later this year. We have also seen good early signs of success with our sales team expansion efforts, growing the team by more than 25% since the end of the third quarter and strengthening our presence in key Midwest, Texas and Florida markets.""We are excited about the development progress on our first coronary product application, including completion of Phase 2 design selection and now three animal studies and two cadaver heart studies with key opinion leader physicians at one of the nation's top clinical institutions. We anticipate filing an IDE application with the FDA in the third quarter of 2024 to allow for the initiation of a clinical study following approval. In entering the coronary space, we seek to offer a superior, simplified, and more predictable clinical outcome for crossing chronic total occlusions in the coronary arteries, a procedure that is currently characterized by complex, highly invasive procedures and uncertain outcomes. We believe that our proprietary image-guided approach has the potential to redefine this large and underserved market, while immediately accessing established reimbursement codes for coronary CTO-crossing and OCT-diagnostic imaging following clearance.""Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial ResultsTotal revenue was $1.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Company has expanded the sales force by more than 25% since the end of the third quarter to drive revenue growth in 2024.Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 20%, compared with 21% in the third quarter of 2023 and 34% in the fourth quarter of 2022. The change in gross margin primarily reflects lower production activity during the fourth quarter of 2023 as the Company seeks to optimize inventory levels and increased non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $5.0 million, compared with $4.4 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in operating expense is primarily related to the increase in sales headcount, corporate expense related to the Zylox-Tonbridge transaction, and non-cash stock-based compensation expense.Net loss and comprehensive loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $5.0 million, compared with $4.5 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $4.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.Adjusted EBITDA, as defined under non-GAAP financial measures in this press release, was a loss of $4.3 million, compared to a loss of $3.7 million in the third quarter of 2023 and a loss of $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. For more information regarding non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this press release, please see ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below, as well as the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure, provided in the tables below.Cash and cash equivalents totaled $5.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company subsequently raised gross proceeds of $7.5 million in March 2024 through the closing of the Zylox-Tonbridge initial equity investment.Concurrent with the Zylox-Tonbridge initial investment, CRG Partners, the primary holder of Avinger debt and preferred equity exchanged its Series A preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $60 million for new Series A-1 preferred stock with a value of $10 million. The new Series A-1 preferred stock is convertible at a conversion price of $3.66 per share and carries no liquidation preference or dividend preference. Additionally, CRG extended principal payments on Avinger's debt from the first quarter of 2024 to the first quarter of 2027, with interest payments accruing during this time.Conference CallAvinger will hold a conference call today, March 20, 2024, at 4:30pm ET to discuss its fourth quarter 2023 financial results.To listen to a live webcast, please visit http://www.avinger.com and select Investor Relations.

The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company's financial results with other companies in its industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures.The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures, and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review these reconciliations.Adjusted EBITDA. Avinger defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss and comprehensive loss plus interest expense, net, plus other income, net, plus stock-based compensation expense plus certain inventory charges plus certain depreciation and amortization expense. Investors are cautioned that there are a number of limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools. Furthermore, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP, and the components that Avinger excludes in its calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the components that its peer companies exclude when they report their non-GAAP results of operations. Avinger compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.

Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The expansion of Allbirds into the Gulf Countries and Southeast Asia represents a strategic move to diversify market presence and reduce reliance on existing markets. The partnership with established distributors like Alyasra Fashion and Primer Group can potentially accelerate market penetration due to their existing networks and consumer insights. However, this shift to a third-party distributor model may impact margins due to distributor fees and could introduce challenges in maintaining brand consistency and customer experience across different regions.Furthermore, the brand's focus on sustainability may resonate well with consumers in these new markets, especially as global awareness of environmental issues grows. This could lead to increased brand loyalty and customer base expansion if executed effectively. It is important to monitor the initial sales and customer feedback post-launch to assess the effectiveness of these partnerships and the adaptability of Allbirds's products in diverse markets. Financial Analyst Entering new markets typically involves significant upfront investment, which may affect short-term financials but can lead to long-term revenue growth. Investors should look for changes in revenue streams and cost structures in upcoming earnings reports. The partnerships mentioned could lead to an increase in top-line growth, but it's essential to keep an eye on the operating margin and how the distributor model affects profitability.It's also worth considering the competitive landscape in these regions, as the presence of brands like Jimmy Choo and Birkenstock could either pose a challenge or offer a complementary dynamic that Allbirds can leverage. The strategic transformation plan suggests a proactive approach to scaling the business, which is generally viewed positively by investors, provided the execution aligns with projected financial models and market expectations. Sustainability Consultant The emphasis on sustainability is an important aspect of Allbirds's brand identity, which could be a differentiating factor in the new markets. The Gulf Countries and Southeast Asia have shown increasing interest in sustainable and ethical fashion, which can be an opportunity for Allbirds to establish itself as a leader in this niche. The partnerships could be a testament to the brand's commitment to sustainability and may enhance its reputation.However, the success of this initiative will largely depend on the ability of Allbirds and its distributors to communicate the value of sustainability to consumers who may prioritize different attributes in footwear. They must also ensure that the supply chain and operations within these regions adhere to the same sustainability standards set by Allbirds to maintain brand integrity. Tracking sustainability metrics and consumer trends will be key in evaluating the long-term impact of these market entries. 03/20/2024 - 04:05 PM Footwear brand to enter two new geographic regionsFinalizes agreements that cover the Gulf Countries and Southeast Asia SAN FRANCISCO, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Allbirds Inc (NASDAQ: BIRD), a global lifestyle brand that innovates with naturally derived materials to make better footwear and apparel products in a better way, has signed definitive agreements with distributors in the Gulf Countries and Southeast Asia.

Total liquidity strengthened by $238 million during fiscal 2024. Negative Revenue decreased by 3% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Operating income and adjusted operating income decreased compared to the prior year. Orders declined by 6% in the International segment. International revenue saw a 6% decline due to macroeconomic factors. Backlog of customer orders was 8% lower than the prior year. Financial Analyst The recent earnings report from Steelcase Inc. indicates a significant increase in earnings per share (EPS) and gross margin, both for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024. Notably, the EPS growth of 127% for the fiscal year and the gross margin improvement of 360 basis points are substantial. Such improvements often reflect effective cost management and pricing strategies, which can be particularly appealing to investors looking for companies with strong profit growth potential.From a liquidity perspective, the increase by $238 million during fiscal 2024 showcases a solid financial position, potentially indicating a lower risk profile and the ability to invest in growth opportunities or return capital to shareholders, as evidenced by the dividend declaration. However, the reported decline in revenue year-over-year could be a point of concern, signaling potential challenges in market demand or competitive pressures. Market Research Analyst The mixed results with respect to revenue and order growth, particularly the regional disparities, highlight underlying market dynamics. The 8% order growth in the Americas versus the 6% decline in International orders, especially the 12% decline in EMEA, suggest that geographic diversification is affecting company performance. Investors should consider how regional economic factors and currency fluctuations might influence future revenues.The focus on large corporate customers and the creation of inspiring workplaces is a strategic move aligning with current trends of workspace transformation. This strategy could drive future growth, but it also raises questions about the company's reliance on a specific customer segment and the scalability of such personalized solutions. Economist Steelcase's performance, particularly in the context of a challenging macroeconomic environment, indicates resilience. The improvement in profitability despite lower volumes is noteworthy and may be indicative of the company's operational efficiency. However, the decline in International markets, attributed to macroeconomic factors, suggests vulnerability to global economic shifts.The company's outlook for fiscal 2025, with an organic revenue growth target of 1 to 5 percent, reflects cautious optimism. It is important to consider the potential impact of ongoing global economic uncertainties on this forecast. The projected improvements in gross margin and operating income suggest a focus on continued efficiency gains, but increased operating expenses may offset some of these gains. 03/20/2024 - 04:05 PM Fourth quarter results Orders grew 4% compared to prior year driven by 8% growth in the Americas Gross margin improved 140 basis points compared to prior yearEarnings per share increased 38% compared to prior year Fiscal 2024 results Gross margin improved 360 basis points compared to fiscal 2023Earnings per share increased 127% compared to fiscal 2023Total liquidity strengthened by $238 million during fiscal 2024 Company provides financial targets for fiscal 2025 GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Steelcase Inc. (NYSE: SCS) today reported fourth quarter revenue of $775.2 million, net income of $21.3 million, or $0.18 per share, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.23. In the prior year, Steelcase reported revenue of $801.7 million, net income of $15.7 million, or $0.13 per share, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.19. Revenue and order growth (decline) compared to the prior year were as follows: Q4 2024 vs. Q4 2023 Revenue Growth (Decline) Organic RevenueGrowth (Decline) Organic OrderGrowth (Decline) Americas(2)% —% 8%International(6)% (6)% (6)%Steelcase Inc.(3)% (1)% 4% Revenue decreased 3 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year, with a 2 percent decline in the Americas and a 6 percent decline in International. On an organic basis, revenue decreased 1 percent, with revenue approximately flat in the Americas and a 6 percent decline in International. The Americas results were driven by a lower beginning backlog compared to the prior year (which was impacted by supply chain disruptions and extended lead times), partially offset by order growth. The International decline was broad based across most markets in EMEA and China, largely related to macroeconomic factors. Orders (adjusted for the impact of divestitures and currency translation effects) grew 4 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year, including 8 percent growth in the Americas and a 6 percent decline in International. The order growth in the Americas was primarily driven by large corporate customers in both continuing and project business. The order decline in International was driven by a 12 percent decline in EMEA, partially offset by 24 percent growth in Asia Pacific. “I'm proud of the earnings improvement our teams delivered again this quarter, capping off a strong fiscal 2024 in which our net income more than doubled from the prior year,” said Sara Armbruster, president and CEO. “Our 8 percent order growth in the Americas in the fourth quarter was driven by our large corporate customers, and we believe this is reflective of customers investing to create inspiring workplaces as they call for a stronger in-office presence.” Operating income (loss) and adjusted operating income (loss) were as follows: Operating income (loss) Adjusted operating income (loss) (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Three months ended Three months ended February 23,2024 February 24,2023 February 23,2024 February 24,2023Americas$26.8 $33.2 $31.3 $41.9 International (1.1) (4.5) 3.1 (3.3) $25.7 $28.7 $34.4 $38.6 Operating income of $25.7 million in the fourth quarter represented a decrease of $3.0 million compared to the prior year, and adjusted operating income of $34.4 million in the fourth quarter represented a decrease of $4.2 million compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to the prior year including $9.2 million of gains on the sales of fixed assets in the Americas, offset in part by a $5.2 million increase in the valuation of an acquisition earnout liability (of which $2.6 million was recorded in each of the Americas and International segments). The impact of lower volume in the current year was offset by higher pricing benefits. “Our International segment continued to deliver improved profitability this quarter, with adjusted operating results increasing by more than $6 million versus the prior year despite lower revenue,” said Dave Sylvester, senior vice president and CFO. “We've delivered two consecutive quarters of strong adjusted operating income, reflecting significant improvement as compared to the first half adjusted operating loss of $15 million.” Gross margin of 31.2 percent in the fourth quarter represented an increase of 140 basis points compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by higher pricing benefits and operational improvements, partially offset by the impacts of lower volume. Operating expenses of $213.5 million in the fourth quarter represented an increase of $6.7 million compared to the prior year. The prior year included $9.2 million of gains on the sales of fixed assets, offset in part by a $5.2 million increase in the valuation of an acquisition earnout liability. The remaining increase included $5.2 million of higher variable compensation expense, partially offset by a $4.5 million decrease from divestitures. Investment income of $2.9 million in the fourth quarter represented an increase of $2.6 million compared to the prior year due to a higher level of cash and cash equivalents and improved investment returns. Other income, net of $4.3 million in the fourth quarter represented an increase of $1.7 million compared to the prior year primarily due to net favorable impacts related to unconsolidated affiliates. The company recorded income tax expense of $5.3 million in the fourth quarter, which represented an effective tax rate of approximately 20 percent and included $0.9 million of discrete tax benefits. Total liquidity, comprised of cash and cash equivalents and the cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance, aggregated to $485.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter, representing an increase of $60.9 million from the end of the third quarter. Total debt was $446.3 million. Trailing four quarter adjusted EBITDA of $264.0 million (or 8.4 percent of revenue) represented an increase of 26 percent compared to the prior year. “Our liquidity increased by $238 million in fiscal 2024, driven by our improved earnings, $120 million of lower working capital, and $49 million of proceeds from fixed asset sales,” said Dave Sylvester. “We also entered into an amended credit agreement this quarter which extended the expiration date to 2029 and expanded the available capacity from $250 million to $300 million.” The Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, to be paid on or before April 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of April 3, 2024. Fiscal 2024 Results For fiscal 2024, the company recorded $3.2 billion of revenue, net income of $81.1 million, earnings per share of $0.68 and adjusted earnings per share of $0.93. In fiscal 2023, the company recorded $3.2 billion of revenue, net income of $35.3 million and earnings per share of $0.30 and adjusted earnings per share of $0.56. Revenue declined 2 percent in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year, with a 1 percent decrease in the Americas and a 7 percent decrease in International. On an organic basis, fiscal 2024 revenue represented a decline of 2 percent compared to the prior year, with revenue approximately flat in the Americas and an 8 percent decline in International. Operating income for fiscal 2024 of $117.8 million represented an increase of $52.3 million compared to $65.5 million of operating income for fiscal 2023. Adjusted operating income for fiscal 2024 of $157.5 million represented an increase of $50.0 million compared to $107.5 million of adjusted operating income for fiscal 2023. The increase in adjusted operating income was driven by pricing benefits and operational improvements, partially offset by lower volume and higher operating expenses. Operating expenses in fiscal 2024 reflected $20.4 million of benefits related to gains on the sales of fixed assets and an earnout liability adjustment, as compared to $7.7 million of net benefits in fiscal 2023 for similar items. “Our fiscal 2024 results reflected our efforts to recover the inflationary pressure on costs from the previous two years and drive improved profitability,” said Sara Armbruster. “We delivered a 360 basis point improvement in gross margin, and we more than doubled our earnings per share. As we focus on leading the transformation of the workplace and helping our customers create inspiring workplaces, we're energized by our order growth from our large corporate customers.” Outlook At the end of the fourth quarter, the company’s backlog of customer orders was approximately $625 million, which was 8 percent lower than the prior year. Orders through the first three weeks of the first quarter of fiscal 2025 grew 10 percent compared to the prior year. As a result, the company expects first quarter fiscal 2025 revenue to be in the range of $715 to $740 million. The company reported revenue of $751.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The projected revenue range translates to a decline of 2 to 5 percent compared to the prior year, or approximately flat to a decline of 3 percent on an organic basis. The company expects to report earnings per share of between $0.05 to $0.09 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and adjusted earnings per share of between $0.08 to $0.12. The company reported earnings per share of $0.01 and adjusted earnings per share of $0.09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The first quarter estimates include: gross margin of approximately 32 percent,projected operating expenses of between $215 to $220 million, which includes $4.3 million of amortization of purchased intangible assets,projected interest expense, investment income and other income, net, of approximately $2 million anda projected effective tax rate of 27 percent. For fiscal 2025, the company is targeting organic revenue growth of 1 to 5 percent compared to fiscal 2024, adjusted operating income of between $150 to $175 million and adjusted earnings per share of between $0.85 to $1.00. Fiscal 2025 includes an additional week compared to fiscal 2024, which is excluded from the organic revenue growth target. The fiscal 2025 targets reflect the following assumptions and expectations, as compared to fiscal 2024: a mid-single digit order growth rate, including continued growth from large corporate customers, offset by the beginning backlog of customer orders which was 8 percent below the prior year,an improvement in gross margin to between 32.5 and 33.5 percent,increased operating expenses driven by higher investments in the company's business transformation initiative, strategic growth initiatives and employee costs (the year-over-year comparison is also impacted by $20.4 million of benefits in the prior year related to gains on the sales of fixed assets and an earnout liability adjustment), andprojected interest expense, investment income and other income, net, of approximately $11 million and an effective tax rate of 27 percent. “As we look to fiscal 2025, we are excited about the progress we made in fiscal 2024 to improve our profitability and the momentum we've seen with our large corporate customers,” said Sara Armbruster. “We are targeting mid-single digit order growth in fiscal 2025 as we execute our strategies to lead the workplace transformation and diversify the customer and market segments we serve.” Business Segment Results (in millions) (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Three Months Ended Twelve Months Ended February 23,2024 February 24,2023 % Change February 23,2024 February 24,2023 % Change Revenue Americas (1)$581.6 $595.6 (2)% $2,419.8 $2,436.2 (1)%International (2) 193.6 206.1 (6)% 739.8 796.4 (7)% $775.2 $801.7 (3)% $3,159.6 $3,232.6 (2)% Revenue mix Americas75.0% 74.3% 76.6% 75.4% International25.0% 25.7% 23.4% 24.6% Operating income (loss) Americas$26.8 $33.2 $143.8 $77.4 International (1.1) (4.5) (26.0) (11.9) $25.7 $28.7 $117.8 $65.5 Operating margin 3.3% 3.6% 3.7% 2.0% Business Segment Footnotes The Americas segment serves customers in the U.S., Canada, the Caribbean Islands and Latin America with a comprehensive portfolio of furniture, architectural, textile and surface imaging products that are marketed to corporate, government, healthcare, education and retail customers primarily through the Steelcase, AMQ, Coalesse, Designtex, HALCON, Orangebox, Smith System and Viccarbe brands.The International segment serves customers in EMEA and Asia Pacific with a comprehensive portfolio of furniture and architectural products that are marketed to corporate, government, education and retail customers primarily through the Steelcase, Coalesse, Orangebox, Smith System and Viccarbe brands.

Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis earnings release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A “non-GAAP financial measure” is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the condensed consolidated statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the company. The non-GAAP financial measures used are (1) organic revenue growth (decline), (2) adjusted operating income (loss), (3) adjusted earnings per share and (4) adjusted EBITDA. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the company has provided a reconciliation of each of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in the tables above. These measures are supplemental to, and should be used in conjunction with, the most comparable GAAP measures. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to monitor and evaluate financial results and trends. Organic Revenue Growth (Decline)The company defines organic revenue growth (decline) as revenue growth (decline) excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign currency translation effects. Organic revenue growth (decline) is calculated by adjusting prior year revenue to include revenues of acquired companies prior to the date of the company's acquisition, to exclude revenues of divested companies and to use current year average exchange rates in the calculation of foreign-denominated revenue. The company believes organic revenue growth (decline) is a meaningful metric to investors as it provides a more consistent comparison of the company's revenue to prior periods as well as to industry peers. Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings Per ShareThe company defines adjusted operating income (loss) as operating income (loss) excluding amortization of purchased intangible assets and restructuring costs. The company defines adjusted earnings per share as earnings per share excluding amortization of purchased intangible assets and restructuring costs, net of related income tax effects. Amortization of purchased intangible assets: The company may record intangible assets (such as backlog, dealer relationships, trademarks, know-how and designs and proprietary technology) when it acquires companies. The company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to net tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The fair value estimates for these intangible assets require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, which include the useful lives of intangible assets. The company believes that adjusting for amortization of purchased intangible assets provides a more consistent comparison of its operating performance to prior periods as well as to industry peers. As the company's business strategy in recent years has included an increased number of acquisitions, intangible asset amortization has become more significant. Restructuring costs: Restructuring costs may be recorded as the company's business strategies change or in response to changing market trends and economic conditions. The company believes that adjusting for restructuring costs, which are primarily associated with business exit and workforce reduction costs, provides a more consistent comparison of its operating performance to prior periods as well as to industry peers. Adjusted EBITDAThe company defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (""EBITDA"") adjusted to exclude share-based compensation and restructuring costs. The company believes adjusted EBITDA provides investors with useful information regarding the operating profitability of the company as well as a useful comparison to other companies. EBITDA is a measurement commonly used in capital markets to value companies and is used by the company's lenders and rating agencies to evaluate its performance. The company adjusts EBITDA for share-based compensation as it represents a significant non-cash item which impacts its earnings. The company also adjusts EBITDA for restructuring costs to provide a more consistent comparison of its earnings to prior periods as well as to industry peers. Forward-looking Statements From time to time, in written and oral statements, the company discusses its expectations regarding future events and its plans and objectives for future operations. These forward-looking statements discuss goals, intentions and expectations as to future trends, plans, events, results of operations or financial condition, or state other information relating to the company, based on current beliefs of management as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, the company. Forward-looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “intend,” “may,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,"" ""target” or other similar words, phrases or expressions. Although the company believes these forward-looking statements are reasonable, they are based upon a number of assumptions concerning future conditions, any or all of which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and vary from the company's expectations because of factors such as, but not limited to, competitive and general economic conditions domestically and internationally; acts of terrorism, war, governmental action, natural disasters, pandemics and other Force Majeure events; cyberattacks; changes in the legal and regulatory environment; changes in raw material, commodity and other input costs; currency fluctuations; changes in customer demand; and the other risks and contingencies detailed in the company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and its other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Steelcase undertakes no obligation to update, amend, or clarify forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. About Steelcase Inc.

Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Barclays Bank PLC regarding the increase in Purchase Price per Note for certain series of exchange-traded notes (ETNs) reflects a strategic move to manage its liabilities and optimize its debt structure. The premium offered above the Closing Indicative Note Value suggests an incentive to encourage note holders to participate in the tender offers. This action can be interpreted as an attempt by Barclays to reacquire debt securities at a favorable rate, potentially reducing interest expenses and improving its balance sheet.From a market perspective, the increase in Purchase Price may signal the bank's confidence in its financial position, allowing it to allocate capital for such transactions. However, the fact that the Purchase Price may be lower than the trading price on the Expiration Date indicates a possibility that investors could sell their notes in the open market for a higher return, leading to a lower participation rate in the tender offer.Investors should monitor the market's reaction to this announcement, as it could influence Barclays' stock performance if the market perceives this as a positive step towards financial optimization or as a sign of potential cash flow challenges. Market Research Analyst The decision by Barclays to increase the Purchase Price for select ETNs is a nuanced move that could impact investor sentiment and the secondary market for these products. Such adjustments often occur in response to market conditions and investor feedback. By offering a premium over the Closing Indicative Note Value, Barclays is likely aiming to make the tender offer more attractive to note holders and ensure a higher acceptance rate.It's important to consider the broader implications for the ETN market. An increase in Purchase Price could lead to a temporary uptick in liquidity as investors may be motivated to trade these notes. Additionally, other issuers in the market might observe Barclays' strategy and consider similar actions for their debt instruments, which could lead to a short-term shift in pricing dynamics across the ETN space.For stakeholders, the key takeaway is to assess the attractiveness of the tender offer against potential market gains, considering the premium offered and the current trading levels of the ETNs involved. The response to this offer could also serve as a barometer for the perceived value and stability of Barclays' ETNs among investors. Debt Capital Markets Expert The amendment to the Purchase Price per Note for certain series of ETNs by Barclays Bank PLC represents a tactical adjustment in the bank's capital management strategy. This move is indicative of Barclays' proactive approach to managing its exchange-traded products and can have implications for the bank's cost of capital. By offering a premium to the Closing Indicative Note Value, Barclays is addressing the market's valuation of these notes and potentially enhancing the appeal of the tender offers.For debt market participants, the increased Purchase Price could be seen as a signal of Barclays' intention to align its debt portfolio with its strategic financial goals. This could affect the perceived risk and creditworthiness of the bank, as it demonstrates active management of its outstanding debt. The impact on the bank's credit spreads and overall debt profile will depend on the success of the tender offers and the subsequent adjustments to its capital structure.Analyzing the historical performance of Barclays' ETNs and the bank's previous tender offers could provide insights into the expected success of the current offers. It's also essential to consider the potential implications for the bank's future debt issuance strategy and how it could influence investor appetite for Barclays' debt securities. 03/20/2024 - 06:24 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Barclays Bank PLC (the “Issuer”) announced today that, in connection with its previously announced cash tender offers (each, an “Offer”) to purchase any and all of its outstanding exchange-traded notes (the “Notes” or the “ETNs”) of sixteen separate series (each, a “Series”) and the solicitation of consents (each, a “Consent Solicitation”) from holders of the Notes (the “Noteholders”) to amend certain provisions of the Notes with respect to each Series, it has increased the Purchase Price per Note applicable to certain Series.

Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this announcement have the meanings given in the Statement. Except as otherwise set forth below, the terms and conditions of the Offers and Consent Solicitations as set forth in Supplement No. 1 will continue to apply. Purchase Price Amendments For each Series listed in the table below, the Purchase Price per Note has been increased from the value specified in Supplement No. 1. The specified Purchase Price per Note for each Series listed below reflects a premium to the Closing Indicative Note Value of that Series on March 20, 2024. The Purchase Price may be lower than the trading price of the Notes of that Series on the Expiration Date. The Expiration Date for each Series is April 3, 2024 and has not changed from the date specified in Supplement No. 1.

If a Noteholder has already validly tendered and not withdrawn its Notes of a Series pursuant to an Offer set forth in Supplement No. 1, such Noteholder is not required to take any further action with respect to such Notes and such tender constitutes a valid tender for purposes of the relevant Offer, as amended hereby. Any increase to the Purchase Price per Note set forth above will be applicable to such Notes. The Purchase Price is payable on April 10, 2024, unless the relevant Offer is further extended or early terminated by the Issuer. Because the Closing Indicative Note Value for each Series is calculated based on the applicable Closing Index Level, if the applicable Closing Index Level has increased as of the Expiration Date, the Purchase Price of that Series may be significantly less than the Closing Indicative Note Value on the Expiration Date. In addition, the Notes of any Series may trade at a substantial premium to or discount from the applicable Closing Indicative Note Value. Accordingly, the Purchase Price for any Series may be lower than the trading price of the Notes of that Series on the Expiration Date. Subject to applicable law, the Offer and Consent Solicitation for each Series is being made independently of the Offer and Consent Solicitation for each other Series, and the Issuer reserves the right, subject to applicable law, to withdraw or terminate the Offer and Consent Solicitation for any Series if any of the conditions described in the Statement have not been satisfied or waived without also withdrawing or terminating any other Offer or Consent Solicitation. In addition, the Issuer reserves the right, subject to applicable law, to extend or amend the Offer and Consent Solicitation for any Series at any time and for any reason without also extending or amending any other Offer or Consent Solicitation.

Our businesses include consumer banking and payments operations around the world, as well as a full-service corporate and investment bank. For further information about Barclays, please visit our website www.barclays.com. Selected Risk Considerations An investment in the ETNs described herein involves risks. Selected risks are summarized here, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks described under “Risk Factors” in the applicable prospectus supplement and pricing supplement. You May Lose Some or All of Your Principal: The ETNs are exposed to any change in the level of the underlying index or exchange rate, as applicable (the “index”) between the inception date and the applicable valuation date. Additionally, if the level of the index is insufficient to offset the negative effect of the investor fee and other applicable costs, you will lose some or all of your investment at maturity or upon redemption, even if the level of such index has increased or decreased, as the case may be. The ETNs are riskier than ordinary unsecured debt securities and have no principal protection. Credit of Barclays Bank PLC: The ETNs are unsecured debt obligations of Barclays Bank PLC and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of or guaranteed by any third party. Any payment to be made on the ETNs, including any payment at maturity or upon redemption, depends on the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC will affect the market value, if any, of the ETNs prior to maturity or redemption. In addition, if Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the ETNs. Market and Volatility Risk: The market value of the ETNs may be influenced by many unpredictable factors and may fluctuate between the date you purchase them and the maturity date or redemption date. You may also sustain a significant loss if you sell your ETNs in the secondary market. Factors that may influence the market value of the ETNs include prevailing market prices of the commodity markets, the U.S. stock markets or the U.S. Treasury market, the index components included in the underlying index, and prevailing market prices of options on such index or any other financial instruments related to such index; and supply and demand for the ETNs, including economic, financial, political, regulatory, geographical or judicial events that affect the level of such index or other financial instruments related to such index. Concentration Risk: Because the ETNs are linked to an index composed of futures contracts on a single commodity or in only one commodity sector, the ETNs are less diversified than other funds. The ETNs can therefore experience greater volatility than other funds or investments. A Trading Market for the ETNs May Not Develop: The ETNs are not listed on any securities exchange. A trading market for the ETNs may not develop and the liquidity of the ETNs may be limited. No Interest Payments from the ETNs: You may not receive any interest payments on the ETNs. Uncertain Tax Treatment: Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the ETNs are uncertain. You should consult your own tax advisor about your own tax situation. The ETNs may be sold throughout the day through certain brokerage accounts. Commissions may apply and there are tax consequences in the event of sale, redemption or maturity of ETNs. Sales in the secondary market may result in significant losses. © 2024 Barclays Bank PLC. All rights reserved. iPath, iPath ETNs and the iPath logo are registered trademarks of Barclays Bank PLC.

Reddit Announces Pricing of Initial Public Offering,2024-03-20T21:45:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Reddit, Inc. announces the pricing of its initial public offering of 22,000,000 shares of Class A common stock at $34 per share, with 15,276,527 shares sold by Reddit and 6,723,473 shares sold by selling stockholders. The underwriters have a 30-day option to purchase an additional 3,300,000 shares. The offering is expected to close on March 25, 2024, under the ticker symbol 'RDDT'.","Reddit Announces Pricing of Initial Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags IPO offering Rhea-AI Summary Reddit, Inc. announces the pricing of its initial public offering of 22,000,000 shares of Class A common stock at $34 per share, with 15,276,527 shares sold by Reddit and 6,723,473 shares sold by selling stockholders. The underwriters have a 30-day option to purchase an additional 3,300,000 shares. The offering is expected to close on March 25, 2024, under the ticker symbol 'RDDT'. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The initial public offering (IPO) of Reddit marks a significant event in the technology and social media sector. The pricing of shares at $34 each, with a total of 22 million shares, indicates a substantial capital influx for the company. The fact that Reddit is selling over 15 million shares implies a direct benefit to their balance sheet. However, the proceeds from the remaining shares sold by existing stockholders will not contribute to Reddit's financials.Investors should note the underwriters' option to purchase an additional 3.3 million shares, which could indicate confidence in the IPO's success or serve as a buffer to stabilize the price post-IPO. The involvement of prominent financial institutions as book-running managers and co-managers could be seen as a vote of confidence in Reddit's market potential.For stakeholders, the short-term implications involve the market's reception of the IPO and the immediate liquidity it provides to selling stockholders. In the long term, the capital raised will likely be directed towards Reddit's growth strategies, which may include expanding their platform, acquiring new technologies, or scaling their advertising capabilities. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the key point of interest is the valuation of Reddit at the time of the IPO. The offer price of $34 per share will set the market capitalization of the company, which investors will compare against Reddit's revenue, user base growth and profitability metrics. This comparison will help assess whether Reddit's IPO is priced appropriately relative to its peers in the social media industry.It is also important to consider the potential dilution of existing shares due to the additional 3.3 million shares option for underwriters. While this may affect the earnings per share (EPS) metric, it could also provide additional capital for Reddit if exercised. Investors should watch for Reddit's post-IPO performance and any strategic moves the company makes with the new capital. Securities Lawyer The legal aspect of this IPO is crucial, as the registration statement for these securities has been declared effective by the SEC, ensuring that Reddit has met all regulatory requirements for going public. Investors should understand that the IPO process is highly regulated to protect their interests. The prospectus, which can be obtained from the underwriters, will provide detailed information about Reddit's financials, risks and the terms of the offering.Additionally, the fact that the offering is not valid in jurisdictions where it would be unlawful highlights the importance of compliance with state and federal securities laws. This compliance is essential for maintaining the integrity of the markets and protecting investor rights. 03/20/2024 - 05:45 PM SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Reddit, Inc.

Par Pacific Announces Expected Increase in ABL Commitments to up to $1.4 billion and Replacement of Intermediation Facility,2024-03-20T21:13:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Par Pacific Holdings, Inc. (PARR) announces an expected increase in lender commitments under its asset-based revolving credit facility to $1.4 billion.

(PARR) announces an expected increase in lender commitments under its asset-based revolving credit facility to $1.4 billion. The company plans to refinance existing financing facilities for Hawaii operations, reducing working capital costs by $10 million annually and increasing funding flexibility. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Par Pacific Holdings regarding the expansion of their asset-based revolving credit facility (ABL) to $1.4 billion, supported by additional collateral assets in Hawaii, signifies a strategic move to optimize their capital structure. The introduction of new collateral, such as refined product inventory and accounts receivable, indicates a solid asset base that could reassure lenders and investors about the company's liquidity and collateral quality. The refinancing of working capital facilities and the establishment of a smaller crude-only intermediation agreement could streamline the company's financial operations, potentially leading to improved cash flow management.By reducing annual working capital financing costs by an estimated $10 million, Par Pacific could enhance its profitability margins and reinvest savings into core business activities, driving long-term growth. The increased funding flexibility may also allow the company to seize market opportunities more effectively, especially in volatile energy markets. However, stakeholders should be aware of the associated risks, such as potential over-leverage or dependence on certain assets as collateral, which could pose challenges if market conditions deteriorate. Market Research Analyst Par Pacific's anticipated refinancing strategy could be seen as a response to evolving market conditions in the energy sector. By securing a larger credit facility and reducing reliance on working capital financing, the company may be positioning itself for competitive advantage. The move to include additional collateral assets suggests a proactive approach to managing their asset utilization, which may be favorably viewed by the market.Investors should consider the potential impact of this refinancing on the company's stock performance. If the market perceives the strategy as strengthening Par Pacific's financial position, it could lead to increased investor confidence and possibly a positive stock price reaction. Conversely, if the execution of these financial maneuvers is not seamless or if market conditions shift unfavorably, there could be negative implications for the stock value. Energy Sector Analyst The energy sector is known for its capital-intensive nature and the importance of liquidity management. Par Pacific's decision to refinance and increase its ABL facility, particularly by leveraging assets in Hawaii, reflects an understanding of the sector's dynamics. The emphasis on flexibility in funding indicates a strategic approach to navigating the unpredictable swings in energy prices and demand.Moreover, the $10 million annual savings in working capital financing costs could provide Par Pacific with a buffer against price volatility in the energy markets. The ability to pivot quickly with financial resources can be a significant competitive edge in the energy industry. Stakeholders should monitor how these financial changes align with the company's operational strategies and whether they support sustainable growth in the long term. 03/20/2024 - 05:13 PM HOUSTON, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Par Pacific Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: PARR) (“Par Pacific” or the “Company”) today announced an expected increase in lender commitments under its existing asset-based revolving credit facility (“ABL”) to up to $1.4 billion.

Global Ship Lease Files its Annual Report for 2023 on Form 20-F,2024-03-20T21:20:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Global Ship Lease, Inc. (NYSE:GSL) filed its Form 20-F with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2023. The company owns 68 containerships with an aggregate capacity of 375,406 TEU, generating contracted revenue of $2.12 billion.","Global Ship Lease Files its Annual Report for 2023 on Form 20-F Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Global Ship Lease, Inc. (NYSE:GSL) filed its Form 20-F with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2023. The company owns 68 containerships with an aggregate capacity of 375,406 TEU, generating contracted revenue of $2.12 billion. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The filing of the Annual Report on Form 20-F by Global Ship Lease, Inc. is a routine regulatory requirement, yet it offers a comprehensive look into the company's financial health and operational performance. The disclosed figures, such as the contracted revenue of $1.72 billion to $2.12 billion and the average remaining charter term of 2.1 to 2.8 years, provide a snapshot of the company's revenue stability and future earnings potential.Investors will be particularly interested in the TEU-weighted average remaining term as it suggests the duration Global Ship Lease can expect to maintain its current revenue streams without renegotiating contracts. The presence of 36 wide-beam Post-Panamax ships in their fleet indicates a strategic positioning to cater to high-capacity routes, which may lead to competitive advantages and potentially higher utilization rates. However, the focus on mid-sized and smaller containerships could expose the company to market segments with different demand dynamics compared to larger vessels.Assessing the implications for stakeholders, the long-term contracted revenue stream provides a degree of predictability and financial stability, which could be favorable for the company's stock performance. However, the shipping industry is cyclical and sensitive to global trade volumes and economic conditions, meaning that investors should monitor the broader market trends that may impact the company's operations. Market Research Analyst Global Ship Lease's fleet composition and contracted revenue figures suggest a robust business model in the short to medium term. With an aggregate capacity of 375,406 TEU and a diversified fleet, the company is well-positioned to benefit from trade lanes that favor smaller to mid-sized vessels. This is particularly relevant as global supply chains evolve and there is a potential shift towards regionalization, which may increase demand for the type of vessels that Global Ship Lease operates.However, the shipping industry is notoriously volatile, with freight rates and vessel values fluctuating in response to economic conditions, trade policies and competition. The company's reliance on fixed-rate charters to top-tier container liner companies could insulate it from market volatility to some extent, but it also limits upside potential during market peaks. The disclosed TEU-weighted average remaining term of the charters is a critical figure, as it reflects not just the current contractual agreements but also the company's ability to navigate the market and secure future contracts.Furthermore, the environmental and regulatory landscape is changing, with increasing pressure on shipping companies to reduce emissions and comply with new regulations. Global Ship Lease's fleet age and specifications will play a significant role in its ability to meet these challenges and maintain profitability in the long run. 03/20/2024 - 05:20 PM ATHENS, Greece, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global Ship Lease, Inc.

ANNOUNCES $100.5 MILLION INVESTMENT BY MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Comstock Resources, Inc. announces a $100.45 million equity investment by majority shareholder Jerry Jones, acquiring 12.5 million shares at $8.036 per share. The investment will increase Jones' ownership to 67% of the company's common shares. Proceeds will be used to pay down bank debt and fund recent acquisitions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The additional equity investment by Jerry Jones in Comstock Resources is a notable development, particularly with regard to the company's capital structure and liquidity. The infusion of over $100 million in equity capital can be seen as a positive signal to the market, suggesting a strong vote of confidence from the majority shareholder. This move is likely to improve the company's balance sheet by reducing leverage, as the proceeds are earmarked for debt repayment.However, investors should be aware of the potential for dilution given the issuance of new shares. The transaction price of $8.036 per share, based on a recent average, may also be scrutinized in terms of fairness and market value. The increase in Jones' ownership stake to approximately 67% further consolidates control, which could have implications for minority shareholders in terms of corporate governance and future strategic decisions. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Comstock's strategic move to pay down bank debt with the equity investment aligns with prudent financial management practices, particularly in the capital-intensive oil and gas industry. The acquisition of undeveloped acres in the Western Haynesville play is indicative of Comstock's growth-oriented strategy. The company's ability to expand its asset base while simultaneously de-leveraging could be viewed favorably by investors seeking stability and growth potential.It is important for stakeholders to consider the long-term implications of this investment, including the company's prospects in the Western Haynesville region. The success of these newly acquired assets in contributing to Comstock's production and revenue will be a critical factor in evaluating the long-term benefits of this transaction. Energy Sector Analyst Comstock's decision to use the proceeds from the equity investment to pay down debt related to recent acquisitions provides insight into the company's strategic priorities within the energy sector. The Western Haynesville play is a significant natural gas resource and Comstock's investment in undeveloped acres there reflects a commitment to securing a competitive position in this region.Investors should consider the potential impact of natural gas prices on Comstock's financial performance, as well as the operational challenges and environmental considerations inherent in developing new acreage. The company's approach to managing these factors will be important in realizing the value from its investment in the Western Haynesville play. 03/20/2024 - 05:45 PM FRISCO, TX, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Comstock Resources, Inc.

Market Research Analyst The appointment of Clint Sever as CEO and the addition of two strategic advisors with significant industry expertise could signal a strategic shift for Cue Health Inc. The market will likely monitor how Sever's product-focused background as Chief Product Officer translates into his new role as CEO. Investors will be interested in the potential changes in corporate strategy, particularly in the commercialization of diagnostics and R&D, areas where the new advisors hold considerable expertise.With Sever at the helm, Cue may accelerate product innovation and improve market penetration, leveraging the advisors' experience in healthcare regulations. This could result in enhanced competitiveness in the diagnostics market. However, the success of such strategic shifts will depend on the company's ability to execute and adapt to regulatory landscapes, which are often complex and variable. Financial Analyst The announcement of a comprehensive review of the company's business and operations suggests a proactive approach to cost management and strategic refinement. Investors should consider the implications of potential cost reductions and strategic realignments on the company's financial health.

It will be essential to monitor Cue's financial reports in subsequent quarters to assess the impact of these changes on revenue growth and profitability.

Cue's focus on refining its strategy and cost structure could be indicative of efforts to align with these industry trends. The expertise of the newly appointed advisors in molecular diagnostics and vaccine development could be particularly beneficial as Cue navigates the complexities of product development and regulatory compliance.The impact of these strategic changes on Cue's market share and industry standing will depend on the company's ability to innovate and effectively commercialize its diagnostics products. This includes navigating the competitive landscape, where larger players often dominate and regulatory hurdles can be significant. The strategic review may result in a more focused approach to targeting market opportunities, which could benefit the company in the long run. 03/20/2024 - 05:21 PM Clint Sever Appointed CEO Board Appoints Two Strategic Advisors Who Bring Significant Industry Expertise SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cue Health Inc.

The company plans to use the proceeds to pay off Senior Unsecured Notes, ensuring a smooth transition for tenants and stockholders.","Piedmont Completes Sale of One Lincoln Park Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc. sells One Lincoln Park for $54 million to pay off maturing debt, maintaining a strong financial position. The company plans to use the proceeds to pay off Senior Unsecured Notes, ensuring a smooth transition for tenants and stockholders. Positive None. Negative None. Real Estate Analyst The sale of One Lincoln Park by Piedmont Office Realty Trust signifies a strategic move within the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector, particularly for Class A office properties. The transaction's all-cash nature suggests a strong buyer interest, indicative of a robust market for premium office spaces in the Sun Belt region. The price of $210 per square foot aligns with the upper tier of market valuations for similar properties in the area.The decision to use the proceeds to pay off maturing debt is a conservative financial strategy. It reduces the company's leverage and interest expense, potentially improving its debt-to-equity ratio and creditworthiness. This action can be seen as a positive signal to investors, as it reflects a prioritization of financial stability over expansion or reinvestment at this time.Retaining property management roles post-sale is a savvy move, maintaining operational continuity and revenue streams. This dual role of seller and property manager often leads to a smoother transition for tenants, which can help stabilize the asset's performance post-transaction and maintain tenant relationships, which are vital in the commercial real estate industry. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the immediate payoff of the 2024 Senior Unsecured Notes is a notable aspect of this transaction. By addressing debt obligations directly with the sale proceeds, Piedmont demonstrates a proactive approach to liability management. This could potentially avert the refinancing risk associated with the debt's maturity, especially in a fluctuating interest rate environment.The earnings-neutral nature of the debt payoff implies that the transaction will not dilute earnings per share (EPS), an important metric for investors. Stockholders might view this as a neutral to positive event, as it suggests management's commitment to maintaining earnings stability while managing liabilities.However, it's important to monitor the occupancy rate, which was reported at 59% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. This is below the industry norm for Class A office space occupancy levels and could signal potential challenges in attracting new tenants or raising rental income in the short term. Long-term implications may include a reevaluation of the company's portfolio strategy, particularly if the trend of lower occupancy rates persists. 03/20/2024 - 05:14 PM Uses Sale Proceeds to Pay off Maturing DebtAtlanta, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc. (""Piedmont"") (""Company"") (NYSE:PDM), an owner of Class A office properties located primarily in the Sun Belt, announced today that it has completed the sale of One Lincoln Park, located at 8401 North Central Expressway in Dallas, TX for $54 million, or $210 per square foot, in an all-cash transaction to a financial institution who plans to use the building as its headquarters. The building is a 10-story, approximately 257,000-square foot, office building which was 59% leased at the end of fourth quarter 2023. The net proceeds from the sale were used to pay off the approximately $50 million remaining balance of the Company’s 2024 Senior Unsecured Notes that mature in March. Commenting on the transaction, C. Brent Smith, Piedmont’s President, and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are pleased to harvest the value in a high-quality asset through the disposition of One Lincoln Park to an all-cash buyer. Proceeds were immediately redeployed to pay off our remaining 2024 Notes on an earnings-neutral basis. Furthermore, Piedmont will be retained as property manager, resulting in a seamless transition for existing tenants and the buyer, as well as a positive outcome for stockholders.” About Piedmont Office Realty TrustPiedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc.

The arbitration tribunal found Glocal liable for breach of contract, directing them to pay damages and legal costs to UpHealth Holdings, Inc. UpHealth is focused on collecting the award and enhancing stockholder value. Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert The arbitration outcome between UpHealth Holdings and Glocal Healthcare Systems represents a significant legal victory with substantial financial implications. The award of $110.2 million in damages, alongside the allocation of legal costs, underscores the severity of the breach of contract adjudicated by the International Court of Arbitration. This decision not only serves as a deterrent against contractual non-compliance but also reinforces the sanctity of international business agreements.From a legal standpoint, the personal liability imposed on Glocal's officers and shareholders is noteworthy. It signals to corporate officers and shareholders globally that they may be held personally accountable for the actions of their companies, especially in cross-border transactions. This case exemplifies the risks involved in international acquisitions and the importance of rigorous due diligence and compliance with contractual terms.The statement from UpHealth regarding board restructuring and the call for resignations indicates a commitment to corporate governance and the protection of stockholder interests. This move could reassure investors about the company's dedication to ethical practices and management accountability, potentially influencing investor confidence and stock performance. Financial Analyst The financial repercussions of the arbitration ruling for UpHealth are multifaceted. The award of $110.2 million could provide a significant capital infusion, which may be allocated towards debt reduction, operational improvements, or shareholder returns. Such a capital boost is likely to be viewed positively by the market, potentially leading to an uptick in UpHealth's stock valuation.However, the actual collection of the awarded damages could present challenges, given the international nature of the dispute and the individual liabilities of the Glocal shareholders. The enforceability of the award across jurisdictions and the financial solvency of the respondents are critical factors in realizing the full financial benefit of the ruling.Investors should also consider the potential impact of the legal victory on UpHealth's future acquisition strategies and partnerships. The demonstrated ability to enforce contractual rights through international arbitration may serve as a precedent for the company's approach to future transactions, potentially affecting its risk profile and attractiveness to potential partners and investors. Corporate Governance Analyst The implications of the arbitration ruling extend into the realm of corporate governance, particularly concerning the composition and integrity of UpHealth's Board of Directors. The call for the resignation of board members allegedly entangled with the Glocal shareholders highlights the importance of an unconflicted board in steering the company post-arbitration.An unencumbered board is essential for the impartial execution of fiduciary duties, including the collection of the arbitration award and the implementation of strategic initiatives aimed at maximizing stockholder value. The potential restructuring of the board, aimed at eliminating conflicts of interest, could strengthen investor trust in the company's oversight mechanisms.Moreover, the proactive stance taken by UpHealth's leadership in addressing governance concerns may serve as a positive signal to the market, reflecting a commitment to transparency and accountability. Such actions can have a favorable impact on investor perception and can be a determinant in investment decisions. 03/20/2024 - 05:00 PM DELRAY BEACH, Fla., March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UpHealth, Inc. (“UpHealth”) (OTC: UPHL), a global digital health company delivering a full continuum of behavioral health solutions through the utilization of evidence-based treatments and services, today provided an update on the arbitration brought by UpHealth Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of UpHealth (“Holdings”), against Glocal Healthcare Systems (“Glocal”) and several of Glocal’s officers and shareholders (together with Glocal, the “Respondents”). On March 18, 2024, the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the “ICA”) transmitted the Final Award to the parties. In the Final Award, the arbitral tribunal (“Tribunal”) found the Respondents liable for breach of contract and directed them to pay Holdings up to $110.2 million in damages, as well as most of the legal costs and other expenses that Holdings incurred in the arbitration. The $110.2 million damages are apportioned based on the shareholders percentage of each of the Indian directors and shareholders of Glocal: 34.38% to be paid by Dr. Syed Sabahat Azim, 34.38% by Richa Sana Azim, 4.69% by Mr. Gautam Chowdhury, 22.54% by Mr. Meleveetil Damodaran, and 4.02% by Kimberlite Social India Private Limited. The dispute arose out of Holdings’ acquisition of Glocal pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement dated October 30, 2020, and the subsequent breach by Respondents of their contractual obligations to relinquish control of Glocal to Holdings. In particular, the Tribunal found that the Respondents “failed to give [Holdings] control of [Glocal]” after the closing of the acquisition, despite the payment in full of the acquisition consideration. The Respondents were held personally liable. UpHealth provided the following statement: “We remain steadfast in our determination to hold fully accountable the Respondents in the ICA proceeding, who sold us Glocal and then refused to relinquish control of it, using misleading and baseless claims, for their indefensible conduct and the resulting harm caused to UpHealth and its stockholders. We appreciate the unanimous decision from the arbitrators and we thank them for a thorough and impartial elaboration and ruling. The Company is now focused on improving UpHealth’s remaining business, collecting the award, and maximizing stockholder value.” Dr. Avi Katz, Chair of UpHealth’s Board of Directors said, “UpHealth and its Board of Directors has always been committed to acting within our fiduciary duties to protect, unlock, and maximize stockholders’ value.” Dr. Katz continued, “Among many other business restructuring actions we have taken and announced in the past, we are committed to ensure that our Board is comprised of individuals who are free from conflict or entanglement with the Glocal bad actors shareholders. In this regard, we are gravely disappointed that two of our fellow Board members, Dr. Chirinjeev Kathuria and Dr. Mariya Pylypiv had joined an investment and voting group with the Glocal shareholders in 2022, when the breach of contract occurred, with respect to the election of directors to the Board of UpHealth in an attempt to actively take control of UpHealth, and that since that time, stockholders affiliated with this investment and voting group have sought to effectuate changes to the corporate governance of UpHealth, including seeking to nominate directors. Given the harmful conduct of the Glocal shareholders, the remainder of the Board calls upon Dr.Kathuria and Dr. Pylypiv to resign immediately from the Board to ensure the UpHealth Board is comprised of directors who will pursue the collection of this award impartially and without conflict or delay.” About UpHealth UpHealth, Inc. is a leading provider of a full continuum of behavioral health solutions through the utilization of evidence-based treatments and services.

Our company is run in a sustainable manner with more than 90% of our energy coming from renewable sources and over 60% of our facilities certified as landfill free through our internal program.” CDP’s annual Supplier Engagement Rating (SER) evaluates corporate supply chain engagement on climate issues.

Negative Net loss as a percentage of net revenues was negative 207.9% in Q4 2023. Net loss as a percentage of net revenues was negative 182.4% for FY 2023. Market Analyst The financial results of 17 Education & Technology Group Inc. indicate a complex scenario where revenue growth is overshadowed by a significant net loss, which has grown year-over-year. The company's gross margin has also declined, suggesting a cost pressure that is not being offset by the revenue generated. The increase in sales and marketing expenses, which is substantial, points towards aggressive customer acquisition strategies. However, this has not translated into profitability, as evidenced by the net loss figures.Investors might view the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a potential for future revenue growth, but the current financial health raises concerns about the sustainability of this strategy. The decrease in research and development expenses could be interpreted as a positive sign of cost control, but it also raises questions about the company's long-term innovation capabilities. The financial results suggest that while the company is attempting to streamline operations and grow its SaaS segment, it has yet to reach a stable and profitable business model. Financial Analyst The unaudited financial results of 17EdTech show a company in transition, with a clear pivot towards its teaching and learning SaaS business. The net loss as a percentage of net revenues has improved slightly when comparing Q4 2023 to Q4 2022, but the overall annual figures present a troubling picture with a significant increase in net loss year-over-year. The adjusted net loss, while a non-GAAP measure that provides a view excluding share-based compensation expenses, still shows a company operating at a substantial loss.Investors should note the company's liquidity position, with a decrease in cash and cash equivalents from the previous year-end. This could impact the company's ability to fund operations and invest in growth without seeking additional capital. The founder's subscription of ordinary shares could be seen as a vote of confidence, but it also dilutes existing shareholders. In the context of the broader edtech industry, which has faced regulatory challenges and competitive pressures, particularly in China, the company's performance and strategic adjustments will be critical in determining its future trajectory and investment potential. EdTech Industry Analyst 17EdTech's financial performance reflects the broader challenges facing the edtech sector in China, including regulatory changes and intense competition. The company's shift away from personalized self-directed learning products to focus on SaaS offerings aligns with industry trends towards digital transformation in education. However, the reported financials raise questions about the efficacy of this strategy in the short term.The year-over-year decrease in net revenues and gross margin, coupled with the substantial net loss, suggest that the company's pivot has yet to gain the financial traction expected. The emphasis on cost control is evident in the reduced operating expenses, but it's essential to balance this with continued investment in product innovation and market expansion to stay competitive. The company's efforts to enhance its SaaS offerings and customer satisfaction are crucial, but the financial results indicate that achieving a return on these investments is still a work in progress. 03/20/2024 - 05:00 PM BEIJING, March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 17 Education & Technology Group Inc.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 17EdTech’s management uses adjusted net income (loss) as a non-GAAP financial measure to gain an understanding of 17EdTech’s comparative operating performance and future prospects. Adjusted net income (loss) represents net loss excluding share-based compensation expenses and such adjustment has no impact on income tax. Adjusted net income (loss) is used by 17EdTech’s management in their financial and operating decision-making as a non-GAAP financial measure; because management believes it reflects 17EdTech’s ongoing business and operating performance in a manner that allows meaningful period-to-period comparisons. 17EdTech’s management believes that such non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating 17EdTech’s operating performance in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. Specifically, 17EdTech believes the non-GAAP measure provides useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain charges that the Company believes are not indicative of its core operating results. The non-GAAP financial measure has limitations. It does not include all items of income and expense that affect 17EdTech’s income from operations.

Revvity Files Complaint and Seeks Injunctive Relief Against Cloud Software Group,2024-03-20T21:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Revvity, Inc. (RVTY) files a complaint against Cloud Software Group for breaching strategic partnership obligations related to Spotfire® software. Revvity reaffirms 2024 revenue guidance amidst legal dispute.","Revvity Files Complaint and Seeks Injunctive Relief Against Cloud Software Group Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Revvity, Inc. (RVTY) files a complaint against Cloud Software Group for breaching strategic partnership obligations related to Spotfire® software. Revvity reaffirms 2024 revenue guidance amidst legal dispute. Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert The legal dispute between Revvity, Inc. and Cloud Software Group (CSG) over the alleged breach of contract and bad faith actions presents a significant risk factor for stakeholders. The core issue lies in CSG's refusal to honor its strategic partnership obligations, which includes exclusive rights to market TIBCO Spotfire® software in certain markets. The request for injunctive relief indicates an urgency to prevent further alleged interference by CSG in Revvity's customer relationships, which could potentially disrupt Revvity's revenue streams and market positioning.From a legal standpoint, the outcome of this litigation could set precedents for software distribution and partnership agreements. If Revvity secures an injunction, it may deter CSG from engaging in similar disputes with other partners. Conversely, if the court rules in favor of CSG, it could embolden other firms to challenge exclusivity clauses. Stakeholders should monitor this situation closely, as prolonged litigation may incur substantial legal costs and divert resources from core business operations, potentially impacting Revvity's financial health and stock performance. Market Research Analyst Revvity's reaffirmation of its 2024 full-year guidance, despite the ongoing legal challenge, suggests a strong business foundation and confidence in its operational resilience. However, investors should consider the broader implications of this dispute on Revvity's market share and customer loyalty. The interference in customer relationships by CSG could potentially erode trust and lead to churn, which is particularly concerning in the competitive landscape of software services.Additionally, the exclusive provision of Spotfire to research and clinical markets underscores Revvity's niche specialization, which could be at risk if CSG's actions dilute the exclusivity. Investors should weigh the potential for market share erosion against the company's revenue projections. The legal battle may also affect Revvity's brand reputation, which is an intangible yet valuable asset. Any damage to the company's reputation could have long-term implications for customer acquisition and retention strategies. Financial Analyst While Revvity's litigation against CSG presents a near-term headwind, the company's maintenance of its revenue and earnings guidance indicates a robust financial outlook that may reassure investors. The legal dispute, however, introduces an element of uncertainty which could lead to stock price volatility. Investors should scrutinize the company's legal strategy and its potential impact on operational costs.It's important to assess the liquidity and cash flow of Revvity to ensure that it can withstand the financial pressures of a legal battle without compromising its growth initiatives or shareholder returns. The dispute may also influence investor sentiment, which could be reflected in the stock's trading volume and price movements. A critical evaluation of Revvity's balance sheet and cash reserves will provide insights into the company's capability to manage this challenge without jeopardizing its financial commitments and strategic investments. 03/20/2024 - 05:00 PM Asserts CSG has acted in bad faith, ignoring obligations as strategic partner for Spotfire® software WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Today, Revvity, Inc. (NYSE: RVTY) announced that it has filed a complaint against Cloud Software Group (CSG) in Massachusetts Superior Court and requested injunctive relief to enforce Revvity’s rights and CSG’s obligations as a strategic partner. CSG is refusing to honor its contractual obligations with Revvity as a strategic partner, including violating the terms of its agreements with Revvity for its TIBCO Spotfire® software. In addition, CSG is interfering in Revvity’s customer relationships by directly contacting Revvity’s customers, as well as engaging in willful misconduct by marketing the Spotfire products in Revvity’s exclusive markets. For over a decade, Revvity has been the exclusive provider of Spotfire to the research and clinical markets. “Continuing to serve our customers remains our top priority, and we will take all actions necessary to enforce our rights and CSG’s obligations in this regard,” stated Kevin Willoe, SVP and general manager at Revvity Signals Software. “We will work to the best of our ability to support our customers while we go through this legal process.

Hawthorne and BFG Supply Forge Strategic Distribution Partnership,2024-03-20T21:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Very Positive,"Hawthorne Gardening Company and BFG Supply form a strategic partnership to distribute Hawthorne's Signature brand cultivation supplies, enhancing customer service and market reach.","Hawthorne and BFG Supply Forge Strategic Distribution Partnership Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags partnership Rhea-AI Summary Hawthorne Gardening Company and BFG Supply form a strategic partnership to distribute Hawthorne's Signature brand cultivation supplies, enhancing customer service and market reach. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The strategic partnership between The Hawthorne Gardening Company and BFG Supply represents a significant realignment in the hydroponic products industry's distribution channels. By exclusively focusing on its Signature brands, Hawthorne is poised to strengthen its brand equity and market presence. Such a move indicates a shift towards vertical integration, where Hawthorne aims to consolidate control over its product innovation and marketing efforts.This partnership could potentially streamline the supply chain, resulting in cost savings and improved margins for both companies. For investors, this suggests a possible enhancement in operational efficiency and profitability. Moreover, BFG's established distribution network could provide Hawthorne with a competitive edge in reaching a broader customer base, potentially increasing market share.However, this transition may involve short-term disruptions as Hawthorne withdraws from distributing third-party products. The impact on those third-party relationships and any contractual obligations will need to be monitored. Additionally, the long-term success of this strategy hinges on the continuous development and consumer acceptance of Hawthorne's proprietary brands. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the announcement of Hawthorne's strategic focus on its proprietary brands, facilitated by BFG's distribution network, is indicative of a pivot towards higher-margin products. This could lead to improved financial performance for The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company, Hawthorne's parent company. By reallocating resources to its own brands, Hawthorne may achieve better control over its pricing strategies and product quality, driving revenue growth.Investors should consider the impact of reduced diversification as Hawthorne narrows its product range to Signature brands. While this could enhance brand loyalty and customer retention, it also exposes the company to market risks associated with brand performance. The partnership with BFG, however, may mitigate some of these risks by ensuring efficient market penetration and distribution.It will be important to observe future financial statements for changes in sales figures, profit margins and operational costs associated with the new distribution strategy. The success of the partnership will also be reflected in the market reaction and the stock performance of The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company in the coming quarters. Supply Chain Expert The collaboration between Hawthorne and BFG is a strategic move that could optimize the supply chain for hydroponic products. By leveraging BFG's national distribution network, Hawthorne can potentially reduce logistical complexities and costs. This efficiency gain not only benefits the companies involved but also the end consumers, who may experience improved product availability and customer service.However, the exclusivity of distribution could raise concerns about supply chain resilience. Dependence on a single distributor might create vulnerabilities in case of disruptions within BFG's operations. Diversification of distribution channels is often a safeguard against such risks and Hawthorne's strategy may require contingency plans to address potential challenges.For stakeholders, the realignment could signal a robust growth trajectory if executed effectively. The focus on proprietary brands suggests confidence in product quality and market demand, which is a positive sign for investors. The ability of both companies to adapt to market changes and maintain a seamless supply chain will be critical for the long-term sustainability of this partnership. 03/20/2024 - 05:00 PM Move enables Hawthorne to bolster focus on innovation and investment in its proprietary Signature brands BFG’s national distribution network and high-quality customer support model bring a new level of service for customers MARYSVILLE, Ohio, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Hawthorne Gardening Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company, and BFG Supply, a leading national horticultural and agricultural product distributor, today announced the formation of a strategic partnership under which BFG will distribute Hawthorne’s proprietary Signature brand cultivation supplies and solutions. The partnership is a key element of both companies’ broader strategies to capitalize on growth opportunities within the hydroponic products industry and deliver value-accretive solutions to growers. Hawthorne strategy Hawthorne is discontinuing the distribution of products from other companies and shifting its focus solely to marketing, innovating and supporting its vast portfolio of Signature brands, including Gavita, General Hydroponics, Botanicare, Cyco, Mother Earth, HydroLogic, Gro Pro and more. These changes enable Hawthorne to realign and optimize its operations. In parallel, BFG will become a key partner for distributing Signature products to many Hawthorne customers. BFG has a national distribution network and a track record of exceptional customer support. “The moves we are making not only serve as a catalyst for Hawthorne’s growth, but also bring both short- and long-term benefits to the retailers who sell our products and the growers who use them,” said Tom Crabtree, COO of Hawthorne. “By sharpening our focus, we will deploy more resources into initiatives and programs that further drive our industry-leading brands as well as enhance customer service and experiences.

(TSX-V: SYH) (OTCQX: SYHBF) (Frankfurt: SC1P) (“Skyharbour” or the “Company”), is pleased to announce that its partner company, North Shore Uranium (“North Shore”), has completed a maiden drill program at its 55,699 hectare Falcon Property (“Falcon” or the “Property”) located at the eastern margin of the Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan. Location Map of Falcon Project:https://skyharbourltd.com/_resources/maps/Sky-SouthFalconOption.jpg?v=0.1 During the program, three targets were drilled along a strong, dominantly northeast-trending electromagnetic (“EM”) conductor system, P03, P08 and P12 (Table 1). At P03 and P08 the targeted sub-vertical EM conductors were intersected. At P12, the hole had to be terminated prior to reaching the interpreted conductor depth. Highlights from the program include: Radioactivity: Elevated total count gamma probe readings were obtained at targets P03 and P08 with a maximum value of 2695 counts per second (“cps”) at P03.Conductor modeling: Three-dimensional plate models of the EM conductor systems were modelled using Maxwell EMIT software. At P03 and P08, the targeted conductors were intersected very close to the depths predicted by the models.Favorable structures: A brittle graphitic fault zone with angular rubble and clay gouge underlain by gneiss with strong silica alteration and patchy chlorite alteration was encountered coincident with the EM conductor at P03. A brittle fault zone with bleached clay, hematite staining and altered pegmatite explained the EM conductor at P08.Next Steps: Fault zones and alteration similar to that encountered at P03 and P08 can be associated with basement-hosted uranium mineralization. The forthcoming analytical results integrated with the drill hole data will guide future work related to these two targets. Target P12 remains untested and should be drilled again to reach the targeted EM conductor depth. It lies within a prominent interpreted structural zone near several other priority targets in the South Walker area. In addition, multiple high priority untested targets on the Property have the potential for basement-hosted uranium mineralization. Using its proven exploration methods, the Company will continue to prioritize these targets for future field evaluation and drilling. Electromagnetics with 2024 Drill Targets P03, P08 and P12: https://www.skyharbourltd.com/_resources/images/Electromagnetics-with-2024-Drill-Targets.jpg Select samples of drill core have been sent for analysis, and final analytical results are expected in four to six weeks. The geochemical analyses are performed to detect the presence of uranium, pathfinder elements, gold and other metals. Mr. Brooke Clements, President and CEO of North Shore stated: “The initial results from our maiden drill program are encouraging and confirm the presence of sub-vertical basement structures with associated radioactivity, graphite and alteration at P03 and P08. The intersection of altered and graphitic structures at the modelled Maxwell plate depths validates our team’s exploration approach and techniques. The initial results from the program also reinforce our belief that Falcon is a highly prospective uranium property and affirm the prospectivity of other compelling untested EM conductors that have been identified, many of which are associated with interpreted structures. The Company is excited to receive the analytical results from this program and looks forward to maximizing its exposure to significant discovery by continuing to evaluate target zones at Falcon with the potential to host an economic uranium deposit.” Total field magnetics with 2024 drill targets P03, P08 and P12:https://skyharbourltd.com/_resources/images/Total-field-magnetics-2024-drill-targets.jpg TABLE 1: Falcon Drilling Summary Drillhole InformationGamma Probe Results*IDProspectDip (°)Azi (°)Over-burden (m)FinalDepth(m)From (m)To(m)Avg.cpsPeakcpsFN24001P03-501356230196.51199.92203.21205.42196.92200.92203.51206.3214758497757052695163710221196FN24002P08-4712030.514442.2545.9510852120FN24003P12-473152.5106No gamma probe testing as hole was abandoned due to unstable ground conditions before target horizon was reached *The results are for total gamma ray counts and were obtained using a Mount Sopris 2SNA-1000-S Spectral Gamma-Ray probe Target P03: Drillhole FN24001 at target P03 in the north Knob Lake area intersected approximately six metres of overburden followed by an alternating succession of metasedimentary rocks comprised of variably garnetiferous and graphitic pelitic gneisses, cross-cut by numerous plagioclase-dominant granitic pegmatites to 222.53m. Granite with intercalations of biotite-garnetiferous pelite was encountered to the end of hole at 230m. The metasediments between 94-175m were host to an estimated 0.1%-1% pyrrhotite and 0.1-0.5% pyrite. A blocky fracture zone and interpreted brittle fault with graphite-rich gouge was encountered within the graphitic gneiss unit between 193.48-196.01m; the projected EM conductor intersection depth was 195m. A key interval just below this fault zone associated with strong localized chlorite and silica alteration between 196.5 and 206.3m returned the most notable gamma probe readings. A pegmatite-rich interval from 196.51-196.92m returned a gamma probe reading of 2695 cps. The combination of the spatial relationship between the graphitic horizon, the structure, alteration and the radioactivity upgrade this target. P03 has the exploration criteria that are important for a basement-hosted uranium mineralizing system. This structure together with other zones of the EM conductor system in the immediate area are prospective as potential conduits for precipitated uranium within basement-hosted graphitic fault zones and follow-up drilling will be considered. Drill Hole FN24001:https://skyharbourltd.com/_resources/images/Drill-hole-FN24001.jpg Target P08: Drillhole FN24002 was also drilled in the northern Knob Lake Area. After intersecting 30.5 metres of overburden, an alternating succession of metasedimentary rocks comprised of variably garnetiferous and graphitic pelitic gneiss and schists cross-cut by numerous plagioclase and K-feldspar granitic pegmatites was encountered to 132.32m. Granitic gneiss intersected by K-feldspar granitic pegmatites is present until the end of hole at 144m. The graphitic metasediments throughout the hole were host to up to 30 percent graphite, with localized patches up to 60 percent. The most notable gamma probe results were returned between 42.25-45.95m, within a K-feldspar pegmatitic interval with a peak reading of 2120 cps. This anomalous interval was followed by a brittle fault zone, from 43.90-49.00m, comprised of fractured pegmatites and blocky and rubbly graphitic metasediments. The entire graphitic schist upper portion of the hole displayed very strong patchy chlorite-cordierite-hematite-illite alteration to 102.27m. From 102.27-105.55m, a brittle pegmatitic and graphitic fault zone was intersected at the projected depth of the Maxwell conductor. This lower fault zone displayed strong bleaching (illite+/-sericite) clay alteration, strong hematite and chlorite along fractures and patchy silica alteration. These alteration minerals can be indicative of a proximal hydrothermal system and the results suggest the possibility that the structures at target P08 could be related to a basement-hosted, fault-controlled mineralizing system and future follow-up drilling will be considered. Target P12: FN24003 was drilled at P12 in the South Walker area within a prominent interpreted northeast-trending structural zone as defined by EM and magnetics. After drilling three metres of glacial overburden, extensively fractured monzonitic orthogneisses cross-cut by plagioclase and K-feldspar granitic pegmatites was encountered to 52.08m. A succession of variably garnetiferous and graphitic metasediments cross-cut by plagioclase-rich pegmatites was encountered to the final hole depth of 107.60m. The hole was abandoned before reaching the modelled Maxwell conductor plate depth of approximately 125m due to unstable ground conditions and was not evaluated with the gamma probe. Therefore, the target remains untested and will likely be targeted for drilling in a future program. Drill Program logistics and Quality Control, Quality Assurance and Analytical Procedures: Multiple potential targets with favorable geologic and geophysical characteristics were evaluated, and three were selected for drilling. The drill program was managed by Laura Tennent, B.Sc of TerraLogic Exploration Inc, (“TerraLogic”). The drill contractor was Quesnel Brothers Diamond Drilling Ltd. based in Denare Beach, Saskatchewan. TerraLogic adheres to best management exploration practices, including Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC). All standard operating procedures have been developed and overseen by Jarrod Brown M.Sc., P.Geo. of TerraLogic, a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. All drill core was systematically photographed, measured (recovery, rock quality designation (“RQD”), natural fracture count, longest stick), oriented (Reflex – ACTIII) and logged (lithology, alteration, mineralization, structure, veins, brecciation and weathering). The core is then scanned with a RS230 Spectrometer to determine total gamma Counts Per Second (CPS), and with a KT-10 magnetic susceptibility meter. Upon completion of the drilling, while the rods are still in the hole, a calibrated Mount Sopris 2SNA-1000-S Gamma-Ray Spectrometer Probe rented from Terraplus Inc. was used to measure the natural gamma spectra within the hole. Measurements for total counts (GR-total, counts per second (“cps”), Potassium cps (K), Thorium cps (Th) and Uranium cps (U) were collected. The data is processed using WellCad software and the Terraplus Inc. calibrated K-Factor. QA/QC protocols are maintained through the random insertion of blanks and certified reference material (standards) throughout the drill core sampling process. Drill core is split in half with a manual splitter, select split samples are then placed in a sealed bag and transported by TerraLogic personnel to the laboratory while the remainder is stored on site. Analytical testing will be performed by the Saskatchewan Research Council Geoanalytical Laboratories in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Falcon Uranium Project: The Falcon Property, which constitutes part of North Shore’s Falcon Property, contains eleven mineral claims comprising approximately 42,908 hectares approximately 50 km east of the Key Lake mine. Nine of the claims are from Skyharbour’s original South Falcon Uranium Project and the remaining two claims are from Skyharbour’s Foster River Project. Historical uranium mineralization discovered at Falcon is shallow and is hosted in several geological settings including classic Athabasca-style basement mineralization associated with well-developed EM conductors. At the EWA target, up to 0.492% U3O8 and 1,300 ppm lead was encountered in outcrop grab samples (Sask. Mineral Deposits Index [SMDI] 5038). Historical grab sampling at Knob Lake (SMDI 1014) also encountered up to 0.01% U3O8 in an outcrop of pegmatite, while anomalous nickel, copper, and molybdenum were found in historical grab samples from the Fraser North target area (SMDI’s 1125 and 1126). A well-defined northeast-trending, locally folded, electromagnetic conductor system runs throughout the Property, which was defined by airborne and ground geophysical surveys by JNR Resources (“JNR”) in the 2000’s. In 2008 JNR conducted a drill campaign at the property area. Of the 47 holes drilled that year, 28 holes (totaling 7,348 metres) were drilled on the South Falcon Uranium Property at the Walker (14 holes), Walker South (7 holes), and EWA target areas (6 holes). At the Walker and South Walker targets, which lie along the aforementioned EM conductor system, structurally disrupted and variably altered metasediments (including graphitic pelitic gneisses) with anomalous boron, copper, molybdenum, nickel, cobalt, arsenic, and vanadium were encountered in several drill holes. During this same drill campaign, the Fraser Lakes Zone B uranium deposit was discovered approximately four kilometres east of the Walker South target on a refolded extension of the EM conductor system. At the EWA target, which lies along a separate northeast-trending EM conductor, anomalous uranium, boron, lead, and molybdenum were encountered in structurally disrupted pegmatites; the best result was 0.235% U3O8 over 0.5 m (within a 3.5 m interval of 0.113% U3O8) in hole WYL-08-501 (Sask. Mineral Assessment File 74H02-0045). Furthermore, in 2022, Skyharbour completed a FALCON® airborne gravity gradiometer and magnetic survey over nine of the eleven claims at the Falcon Property. This new geophysical data will assist North Shore in prioritizing areas along the EM conductor system for drilling. Over 30 kilometres of the EM conductor system remains untested on the Falcon Property. North Shore’s initial focus will be on the two claims formerly part of the Foster Project (geophysics), and on generating drill targets on three claims at the southeastern end of the EM conductor systems including Knob Lake, which shows similarities to the Fraser Lakes Zone B deposit approximately 6 km to the northeast and several other high-priority targets elsewhere along the main EM conductor system. Significant potential exists on the project for basement-hosted, unconformity-related uranium deposits like those further to the north in the Wollaston Domain (i.e. Eagle Point, Rabbit Lake, Key Lake and others), as well as for pegmatite/granite-hosted (i.e. alaskite-type) U-Th-REE mineralization like at the Fraser Lakes Zone B deposit on Skyharbour’s adjacent South Falcon East Property, currently under option to Tisdale Clean Energy. The Option Agreement: North Shore may acquire an initial 80% interest in the Property by issuing common shares of the Resulting Issuer (“Shares”) having an aggregate value of CAD $1,225,000; making aggregate cash payments of CAD $525,000; and incurring an aggregate of CAD $3,550,000 in exploration expenditures on the Property over a three-year period. Once North Shore has earned an initial 80% interest in the Property, North Shore may acquire the remaining 20% interest in the Property within 90 business days by issuing Shares having a value of CAD $5,000,000, and making a cash payment of CAD $5,000,000 to Skyharbour. If North Shore does not elect to acquire the remaining 20% interest, a joint venture will be formed with Skyharbour holding a 20% participating interest. North Shore will be the operator of the exploration programs during the earn-in stage and for the joint venture if formed. Two claims totaling 10,673 hectares that form part of Skyharbour’s Foster River Property are subject to a one percent (1%) NSR royalty payable to Skyharbour. The remaining nine claims totaling 32,235 hectares that comprise Skyharbour’s South Falcon Point Property are subject to a two percent (2%) NSR royalty payable to Denison Mines Corp. (“Denison”) with North Shore having the right to purchase one percent of the royalty from Denison at anytime by paying $1 million. All Shares will be subject to a four-month-and-one-day statutory hold period in accordance with applicable securities laws. Qualified Person: The technical information in this news release has been prepared in accordance with the Canadian regulatory requirements set out in National Instrument 43-101 and reviewed and approved by David Billard, P.Geo., a Consulting Geologist for Skyharbour as well as a Qualified Person. About North Shore Uranium Ltd: North Shore is a mineral exploration company focused on uranium exploration at the eastern margin of the Athabasca Basin through its Falcon property which will increase from 12,800 to 55,700 hectares with the addition of the claims subject to the Agreement, and the West Bear property located 90 kilometres to the northeast. About Skyharbour Resources Ltd.: Skyharbour holds an extensive portfolio of uranium exploration projects in Canada's Athabasca Basin and is well positioned to benefit from improving uranium market fundamentals with twenty-nine projects, ten of which are drill-ready, covering over 587,000 hectares (over 1.45 million acres) of land. Skyharbour has acquired from Denison Mines, a large strategic shareholder of the Company, a 100% interest in the Moore Uranium Project which is located 15 kilometres east of Denison's Wheeler River project and 39 kilometres south of Cameco's McArthur River uranium mine. Moore is an advanced-stage uranium exploration property with high-grade uranium mineralization at the Maverick Zone that returned drill results of up to 6.0% U3O8 over 5.9 metres including 20.8% U3O8 over 1.5 metres at a vertical depth of 265 metres. Adjacent to the Moore Uranium Project is Skyharbour’s recently optioned Russell Lake Uranium Project from Rio Tinto, which hosts historical high-grade uranium drill intercepts over a large property area with robust exploration upside potential. The Company is actively advancing these projects through exploration and drill programs. Skyharbour has joint-ventures with industry-leader Orano Canada Inc., Azincourt Energy and Valor Resources at the Preston, East Preston and Hook Lake Projects, respectively. The Company also has several active earn-in option partners including: CSE-listed Basin Uranium Corp. at the Mann Lake Uranium Project; CSE-listed Medaro Mining Corp. at the Yurchison Project; North Shore Uranium at the Falcon Project; and TSX-V listed Tisdale Clean Energy at the South Falcon East Project which is host to the Fraser Lakes Zone B Uranium and Thorium Deposit. In aggregate, Skyharbour has now signed earn-in option agreements with partners that total to over $33 million in partner-funded exploration expenditures, over $27 million worth of shares being issued and over $19 million in cash payments coming into Skyharbour, assuming that these partner companies complete their entire earn-ins at the respective projects. Skyharbour's goal is to maximize shareholder value through new mineral discoveries, committed long-term partnerships, and the advancement of exploration projects in geopolitically favourable jurisdictions.

The approval signifies a significant milestone in bringing cell therapy into earlier treatment lines, offering hope to patients with options. Abecma has a well-established safety profile and has demonstrated superior efficacy over standard regimens, leading to improved progression-free survival and overall response rates. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The European Commission's approval of Abecma for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma offers a significant advancement in the treatment landscape. This is the first chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy available for use in earlier lines of treatment for this patient population in the EU. The clinical data showing a 51% reduction in risk of disease progression or death is a substantial improvement over the current standard regimens. From a medical perspective, this approval could potentially lead to a paradigm shift in how multiple myeloma is managed after first-line therapies fail.Abecma's safety profile, with mostly low-grade and transient occurrences of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity, suggests that the therapy is generally well-tolerated, which is important for patient quality of life. However, it's important to note that while the median overall survival (OS) data appears promising, the crossover design of the KarMMa-3 trial may have confounded these results. Thus, further studies and real-world evidence are needed to fully understand the long-term benefits and potential risks associated with Abecma. Medical Research Analyst The approval of Abecma by the European Commission is not only a milestone for Bristol Myers Squibb but also represents a notable development in the biotechnology sector. The data from the KarMMa-3 clinical trial underscores the effectiveness of personalized cell therapies in treating complex hematologic cancers. The observed progression-free survival (PFS) of 13.8 months compared to 4.4 months with standard regimens indicates a meaningful clinical benefit.From a research standpoint, the success of this therapy could encourage further investment in CAR T-cell therapies and other forms of personalized medicine. The manufacturing success rate of over 90% reported by Bristol Myers Squibb suggests that the company has addressed some of the initial challenges associated with the production of these complex therapies, which could have positive implications for the scalability and accessibility of Abecma across the EU. Market Research Analyst The approval of Abecma in the European Union is likely to have a positive impact on Bristol Myers Squibb's market position in the oncology segment. As the first CAR T cell therapy approved for earlier lines of treatment for multiple myeloma in the EU, Abecma could potentially capture a significant market share from existing therapies. The company's focus on increasing manufacturing capacity and successful global manufacturing rate are indicators of its commitment to meet demand and may positively influence investor sentiment.Moreover, the completion of reimbursement procedures will be a critical factor in determining the commercial success of Abecma in the EU. The adoption rate by healthcare providers and the therapy's inclusion in treatment guidelines will also play a role in its market penetration. Investors should monitor the post-approval real-world efficacy and safety data, as this will influence long-term adoption and the potential for expansion into additional markets. 03/20/2024 - 04:45 PM Abecma demonstrated superiority over standard regimens in the Phase 3 KarMMa-3 trial, with a 51% reduction in risk of disease progression or death and a well-established safety profile with mostly low-grade and transient occurrences of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity Approval reinforces Bristol Myers Squibb’s commitment to bring the transformative potential of cell therapy into earlier lines of treatment PRINCETON N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted approval to Abecma® (idecabtagene vicleucel; ide-cel) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), a proteasome inhibitor (PI), and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. Abecma is the first chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy approved in the European Union (EU) for use in earlier lines of therapy for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. This expanded approval of Abecma covers all EU member states.* In the EU, Abecma has maintained its Orphan Designation for the treatment of multiple myeloma. “Today’s approval in the European Union marks an exciting milestone in our efforts to bring the transformative potential of cell therapies into earlier lines of treatment,” said Monica Shaw, M.D., senior vice president and head of European Markets, Bristol Myers Squibb. “Abecma is an important treatment option for patients with triple-class exposed relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies and is leading the way toward a promising shift in the treatment paradigm.” The current treatment paradigm for multiple myeloma includes IMiDs, PIs, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies; however, many patients go on to relapse and/or become refractory to these classes of therapy. With increased use of the three main classes of therapy as combination regimens, more patients are becoming triple-class exposed earlier in their treatment journey. There have historically been limited options for patients with triple-class exposed relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma, and patients tend to have poor outcomes with a median progression-free survival of three to five months. “As patients with multiple myeloma become exposed to the three main classes of therapy earlier in treatment and still experience relapsed and/or refractory disease, it is critical that we continue to add innovative treatment options to our arsenal that can potentially provide long-term disease control,” said Paula Rodriguez-Otero, M.D., Ph.D., Department of Hematology, Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain. “This expanded approval of ide-cel represents key progress in bringing a personalized therapy that delivers significantly improved, durable outcomes to patients with triple-class exposed relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma after two prior therapies.” With a significant increase in manufacturing capacity and over 90% manufacturing success rate globally, Bristol Myers Squibb is prepared to meet increased demand for Abecma. The company is focused on making Abecma available in the EU for this indication, including completion of reimbursement procedures. Based on the KarMMa-3 study, Abecma is also the first cell therapy approved in Switzerland for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior lines of therapies and the first cell therapy approved in Japan for adult patients with triple-class exposed relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after two prior lines of therapy. Abecma is also approved in the U.S. for adult patients with triple-class exposed relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after four or more prior lines of therapy and approved in Great Britain and Israel for adult patients with triple-class exposed relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma after three or more prior lines of therapy. A supplemental Biologics License Application for Abecma for triple-class exposed relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma is currently under review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) recently voted positively that Abecma demonstrated a favorable benefit/risk profile for patients with triple-class exposed relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma based on results from the pivotal Phase 3 KarMMa-3 study. *Centralized Marketing Authorization does not include approval in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales). Abecma KarMMa-3 Clinical Trial Results The EC approval of Abecma is based on results from KarMMa-3, a pivotal Phase 3, open-label, global, randomized controlled study evaluating Abecma compared to standard combination regimens in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who received two to four prior lines of treatment, including an IMiD, a PI, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (triple-class exposed), and who were refractory to the last treatment regimen. At a pre-specified interim analysis with a median follow-up of 18.6 months, treatment with Abecma (n=254) significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS), the study’s primary endpoint, compared to standard regimens (n=132), with a median PFS of 13.8 months (95% CI: 11.8-16.1) versus 4.4 months (95% CI: 3.4-5.8) (HR: 0.49 [95% CI: 0.38-0.63]; p<0.0001), representing a 51% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death. Results from the primary analysis, with a median follow-up of 30.9 months, were consistent with the interim analysis and represent the longest follow-up for a randomized Phase 3 CAR T cell therapy in this patient population. Treatment with Abecma also showed a significant improvement in overall response rate (ORR) with the majority (71.3% [95% CI: 65.7-76.8]) of patients treated with Abecma achieving a response, and 43.7% achieving a complete or stringent complete response. In comparison, less than half of patients (42.4% [95% CI: 34-50.9]) who received standard regimens achieved a response, with 5.3% experiencing a complete response or stringent complete response. The KarMMa-3 trial had a patient-centric design that allowed for crossover from standard regimens to Abecma upon confirmed disease progression, with more than half (56%) of patients in the standard regimens arm crossing over to receive Abecma as a subsequent therapy, due to disease progression while receiving standard regimens. Median overall survival (OS), a secondary endpoint of the study, was 41.4 months with Abecma (95% CI: 30.9-NR) and 37.9 months with standard regimens (95% CI: 23.4-NR) (95% CI: 0.73-1.40; HR: 1.01). Based on real-world evidence, median OS for patients with triple-class exposed relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma is approximately 13 months, underscoring the confounding impact that crossover had on the median OS observed with standard regimens in the KarMMa-3 trial. Based on a pooled analysis of the KarMMa, CRB-401 and KarMMa-3 studies (n=409), Abecma has exhibited a well-established and consistent safety profile with mostly low-grade and transient occurrences of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. In patients treated with Abecma, any grade CRS has occurred in 84.6% of patients, with Grade ≥3 CRS occurring in 5.1% of patients and fatal (Grade 5) CRS reported in 0.7% of patients. The median time to onset of CRS was one day (range: 1 to 17) and the median duration of CRS was four days (range: 1 to 63). In the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies (n=353), any-grade neurotoxicity occurred in 16.1% of patients, with Grade 3/4 neurotoxicity occurring in 3.1% of patients, and no Grade 5 events reported. Median time to onset of neurotoxicity was three days (range: 1-317 days) and median duration of neurotoxicity was three days (range: 1-252 days). No cases of Parkinsonism were reported.

U.S. Important Safety Information BOXED WARNING: CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME, NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES, HLH/MAS, AND PROLONGED CYTOPENIA Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients following treatment with ABECMA. Do not administer ABECMA to patients with active infection or inflammatory disorders. Treat severe or life-threatening CRS with tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids. Neurologic Toxicities, which may be severe or life-threatening, occurred following treatment with ABECMA, including concurrently with CRS, after CRS resolution, or in the absence of CRS. Monitor for neurologic events after treatment with ABECMA. Provide supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed. Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (HLH/MAS) including fatal and life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients following treatment with ABECMA. HLH/MAS can occur with CRS or neurologic toxicities. Prolonged Cytopenia with bleeding and infection, including fatal outcomes following stem cell transplantation for hematopoietic recovery, occurred following treatment with ABECMA. ABECMA is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the ABECMA REMS. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS: Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS): CRS, including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred following treatment with ABECMA in 85% (108/127) of patients. Grade 3 or higher CRS occurred in 9% (12/127) of patients, with Grade 5 CRS reported in one (0.8%) patient. The median time to onset of CRS, any grade, was 1 day (range: 1 - 23 days) and the median duration of CRS was 7 days (range: 1 - 63 days). The most common manifestations included pyrexia, hypotension, tachycardia, chills, hypoxia, fatigue, and headache. Grade 3 or higher events that may be associated with CRS include hypotension, hypoxia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypofibrinogenemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), atrial fibrillation, hepatocellular injury, metabolic acidosis, pulmonary edema, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and HLH/MAS. Identify CRS based on clinical presentation. Evaluate for and treat other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. CRS has been reported to be associated with findings of HLH/MAS, and the physiology of the syndromes may overlap. In patients with progressive symptoms of CRS or refractory CRS despite treatment, evaluate for evidence of HLH/MAS. Fifty four percent (68/127) of patients received tocilizumab (single dose: 35%; more than 1 dose: 18%). Overall, 15% (19/127) of patients received at least 1 dose of corticosteroids for treatment of CRS. All patients that received corticosteroids for CRS received tocilizumab. Ensure that a minimum of 2 doses of tocilizumab are available prior to infusion of ABECMA. Monitor patients at least daily for 7 days following ABECMA infusion at the REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs or symptoms of CRS and monitor patients for signs or symptoms of CRS for at least 4 weeks after ABECMA infusion. At the first sign of CRS, institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids as indicated. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time. Neurologic Toxicities: Neurologic toxicities, including immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), which may be severe or life- threatening, occurred concurrently with CRS, after CRS resolution, or in the absence of CRS following treatment with ABECMA. Neurologic toxicities occurred in 28% (36/127) of patients receiving ABECMA, including Grade 3 in 4% (5/127) of patients. One patient had ongoing Grade 2 neurotoxicity at the time of death. Two patients had ongoing Grade 1 tremor at the time of data cutoff. The median time to onset of neurotoxicity was 2 days (range: 1 - 42 days). CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity resolved in 92% (33/36) of patients with a median time to resolution of 5 days (range: 1 - 61 days). The median duration of neurotoxicity was 6 days (range: 1 - 578) in all patients including 3 patients with ongoing neurotoxicity. Thirty-four patients with neurotoxicity had CRS with onset in 3 patients before, 29 patients during, and 2 patients after CRS. The most frequently reported manifestations of CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity include encephalopathy, tremor, aphasia, and delirium. Grade 4 neurotoxicity and cerebral edema in 1 patient, Grade 3 myelitis, and Grade 3 parkinsonism have been reported with ABECMA in another study in multiple myeloma. Monitor patients at least daily for 7 days following ABECMA infusion at the REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs or symptoms of neurologic toxicities and monitor patients for signs or symptoms of neurologic toxicities for at least 4 weeks after ABECMA infusion and treat promptly. Rule out other causes of neurologic symptoms. Neurologic toxicity should be managed with supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms occur at any time. Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS): HLH/MAS occurred in 4% (5/127) of patients receiving ABECMA. One patient developed fatal multi-organ HLH/MAS with CRS and another patient developed fatal bronchopulmonary aspergillosis with contributory HLH/MAS. Three cases of Grade 2 HLH/MAS resolved. All events of HLH/MAS had onset within 10 days of receiving ABECMA with a median onset of 7 days (range: 4 - 9 days) and occurred in the setting of ongoing or worsening CRS. Two patients with HLH/MAS had overlapping neurotoxicity. The manifestations of HLH/MAS include hypotension, hypoxia, multiple organ dysfunction, renal dysfunction, and cytopenia. HLH/MAS is a potentially life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate if not recognized early and treated. Treatment of HLH/MAS should be administered per institutional guidelines. ABECMA REMS: Due to the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, ABECMA is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the ABECMA REMS. Further information is available at www.AbecmaREMS.com or 1-888-423-5436. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Allergic reactions may occur with the infusion of ABECMA. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may be due to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in ABECMA. Infections: ABECMA should not be administered to patients with active infections or inflammatory disorders. Severe, life-threatening, or fatal infections occurred in patients after ABECMA infusion. Infections (all grades) occurred in 70% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 infections occurred in 23% of patients. Overall, 4 patients had Grade 5 infections (3%); 2 patients (1.6%) had Grade 5 events of pneumonia, 1 patient (0.8%) had Grade 5 bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and 1 patient (0.8%) had cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia associated with Pneumocystis jirovecii. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after ABECMA infusion and treat appropriately. Administer prophylactic, pre-emptive, and/or therapeutic antimicrobials according to standard institutional guidelines. Febrile neutropenia was observed in 16% (20/127) of patients after ABECMA infusion and may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care. Viral Reactivation: CMV infection resulting in pneumonia and death has occurred following ABECMA administration. Monitor and treat for CMV reactivation in accordance with clinical guidelines. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur in patients treated with drugs directed against plasma cells. Perform screening for CMV, HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing. Prolonged Cytopenias: In the clinical study, 41% of patients (52/127) experienced prolonged Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and 49% (62/127) experienced prolonged Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia that had not resolved by Month 1 following ABECMA infusion. In 83% (43/52) of patients who recovered from Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia after Month 1, the median time to recovery from ABECMA infusion was 1.9 months. In 65% (40/62) of patients who recovered from Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, the median time to recovery was 2.1 months. Three patients underwent stem cell therapy for hematopoietic reconstitution due to prolonged cytopenia. Two of the three patients died from complications of prolonged cytopenia. Monitor blood counts prior to and after ABECMA infusion. Manage cytopenia with myeloid growth factor and blood product transfusion support. Hypogammaglobulinemia: Hypogammaglobulinemia was reported as an adverse event in 21% (27/127) of patients; laboratory IgG levels fell below 500 mg/dl after infusion in 25% (32/127) of patients treated with ABECMA. Monitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment with ABECMA and administer IVIG for IgG <400 mg/dl. Manage appropriately per local institutional guidelines, including infection precautions and antibiotic or antiviral prophylaxis. The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or after ABECMA treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during ABECMA treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment with ABECMA. Secondary Malignancies: Patients treated with ABECMA may develop secondary malignancies. Monitor life-long for secondary malignancies. If a secondary malignancy occurs, contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-888-805-4555 to obtain instructions on patient samples to collect for testing of secondary malignancy of T cell origin. Effects on Ability to Drive and Operate Machinery: Due to the potential for neurologic events, patients receiving ABECMA are at risk for altered or decreased consciousness or coordination in the 8 weeks following ABECMA infusion. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, during this initial period. Adverse Reactions: The most common nonlaboratory adverse reactions include CRS, infections – pathogen unspecified, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, hypogammaglobulinemia, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, viral infections, encephalopathy, edema, pyrexia, cough, headache, and decreased appetite.

The company's net income surged to $6.9 million, reflecting a significant improvement over the previous year. Nortech's management is optimistic about the future, citing positive industry trends, normalized customer demand, and strategic investments in new technologies. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recently reported financial results by Nortech Systems Incorporated indicate a positive trajectory in the company's performance, with a 3.9% increase in net sales and a significant rise in net income by 242.0% compared to the previous year. The growth in net sales, although modest, is a healthy sign for the company's market position, especially considering the complexities of the current economic climate. The substantial increase in net income can be attributed to both operational efficiency and a one-time non-cash tax benefit.It is noteworthy that the company's gross margin improved by 130 basis points, which suggests that Nortech has been successful in managing its cost of goods sold or has moved towards higher-margin products. The stable year-end 90-day backlog, consistent with the previous year, suggests a steady demand for the company's offerings, which is important for future revenue streams.Looking at the broader industry, the reference to the IPC survey forecasting industry revenue growth in 2024 provides a favorable context for Nortech's business outlook. The company's focus on generating cash and strengthening the balance sheet, coupled with increased borrowing capacity and investments in new technologies like Expanded Beam Xtreme™ fiber optic technology, indicate strategic moves to capitalize on emerging market opportunities and enhance competitiveness. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the 38.2% increase in EBITDA is a strong indicator of Nortech's operational profitability and efficiency. This metric is particularly important for investors as it provides a clearer picture of the company's financial health by excluding non-operating expenses such as taxes and interest. The significant improvement in EBITDA, in conjunction with the gross margin expansion, suggests that the company is not only increasing sales but is also becoming more profitable.The non-cash tax benefit of $2.6 million is a one-time event that investors should consider when evaluating the company's recurring earning potential. While it has positively impacted the reported net income, it is not reflective of the company's ongoing operational performance. The company's strategic investments in information technology and human resource systems, despite inflationary pressures, indicate a focus on long-term growth and operational scalability.The restructuring of the credit agreement with Bank of America is also a strategic move that enhances the company's financial flexibility. By increasing borrowing capacity, Nortech is better positioned to invest in growth initiatives or weather potential economic downturns, which is reassuring for stakeholders. Environmental Sustainability Analyst From an environmental sustainability standpoint, the introduction of the Expanded Beam Xtreme™ fiber optic technology represents Nortech's commitment to innovation with an eye on sustainability. Fiber optics technology is increasingly being recognized for its energy efficiency and reduced material usage, which aligns with global trends towards more sustainable production and operation practices.As companies and investors alike are placing greater emphasis on environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria, Nortech's investment in technologies that offer sustainability advantages could enhance its appeal to a growing segment of socially responsible investors. This strategic direction not only benefits customers but also positions the company as a forward-thinking player in the market, potentially attracting investment and partnerships that prioritize sustainability.The durability and efficiency of fiber optics over traditional copper wire can also lead to cost savings and longer product lifecycles, which in turn could have a positive impact on the company's profitability and brand reputation in the long term. 03/20/2024 - 04:41 PM Full Year Net Sales Up Nearly 4% from Prior Year; Gross Margin Increase 130 Basis Points from Prior Year EBITDA Increases to $8.0 million, Up 38.2% from Prior Year MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Nortech Systems Incorporated (Nasdaq: NSYS) (“Nortech” or, the ""Company""), a leading provider of engineering and manufacturing solutions for complex electromedical and electromechanical products serving the medical, industrial and defense markets, reported 2023 fourth quarter and full year results for the period ended December 31, 2023. 2023 Highlights: Net sales of $139.3 million, up 3.9% from the prior year. Net income of $6.9 million, or $2.38 per diluted share, compared with net income of $2.0 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, in 2022. Fourth quarter 2023 net income includes a non-cash tax benefit of $2.6 million for the reversal of a previously established tax valuation allowance. Gross margin of 16.6%, up 130 basis points from gross margin of 15.3% in the prior year. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $8.0 million, compared with EBITDA of $5.8 million in the prior year. Year-end 90-day backlog of $35.1 million as of December 31, 2023, consistent with the prior year-end level. Management Commentary “As expected, we ended 2023 strong, including record revenue both in the fourth quarter and the year, continued expense management and solid margins,” said Jay D. Miller, President and CEO of Nortech. “We saw encouraging normalization trends in supply chain and customer ordering practices, approaching pre-Covid levels. These factors had inflated our backlog levels in 2022 and early 2023, but we believe the situation has returned to a steady state. “Our overall financial results are a credit to the nearly 800 dedicated Nortech employees worldwide who embody our corporate values, including teamwork, excellence, commitment, integrity and innovation,” Miller noted. “I am proud of Nortech’s collaborative culture and the important role it plays in successfully retaining our people; they truly are our most valuable asset in delivering mission-critical products and solutions to our customers. “For example, our highly skilled engineering services team is essential to providing our customers with Nortech’s full-system solution by helping them to improve manufacturability of products and reduce costs,” explained Miller. “Nortech’s ability to quickly and flexibly adapt our global resources to fit our customers’ changing needs is a key competitive advantage.” 2023 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results ($ in thousands) Q4 23 Q4 22 % Full Year 2023 Full Year 2022 % Net sales $36,054 $35,618 1.2 % $139,332 $134,123 3.9% Gross Profit $6,827 $5,104 33.8 % $23,104 $20,480 12.8% Operating Expenses $4,151 $4,255 2.4% $17,151 $16,592 (3.4%) Net Income $4,352 $(381) N/A $6,874 $2,010 242.0% EBITDA $3,188 $1,227 159.8% $8,003 $5,791 38.2% In 2023, net sales totaled $139.3 million. This represents a 3.9% increase from net sales of $134.1 million in 2022. GAAP net income totaled $6.9 million, or $2.38 per diluted share, in 2023, up from GAAP net income of $2.0 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, in the prior year. Fourth quarter 2023 GAAP net income included a non-cash tax benefit of $2.6 million related to the release of a previously established tax valuation allowance in alignment with the Company’s historical and projections of future taxable income. For the full year 2023, gross profit totaled $23.1 million, or 16.6%, compared with gross profit of $20.5 million, or 15.3%, in the prior year. In 2023 operating expenses totaled $17.2 million, a 3.4% increase from the prior year operating expenses of $16.6 million. The increase in year-over-year operating expense was primarily driven by investments in information technology and human resource systems earlier in the year, payroll and inflationary pressures. In 2023 EBITDA totaled $8.0 million, a 38.2% increase from EBITDA of $5.8 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increase in EBITDA resulted primarily from the previously highlighted net sales increase over the same period. Business Outlook “We expect our positive momentum to continue into 2024, buoyed by encouraging industry trends and our own solid internal execution,” commented Miller. “Last month the global trade organization IPC released survey results forecasting industry revenue growth in 2024. This outlook, plus continued normalization of customer demand levels, supply chain improvements, and our careful expense management, gives us confidence as we go forward. “Nortech remains focused on business fundamentals including generating cash and strengthening our balance sheet. In support of that, we recently restructured our credit agreement with Bank of America to increase our borrowing capacity and better complement our business. “We are prudently investing in promising new technologies that will benefit both our customers and the environment,” explained Miller. Earlier this year, Nortech introduced Expanded Beam Xtreme™ fiber optic technology, designed for digital data transmission and offering boosted speed, reliability and interference protection. Concluded Miller, “Along with enhanced performance capabilities, fiber optics offer our customers many sustainability advantages over traditional copper wire, in both production and operation. Benefits include greater durability, improved energy efficiency and less material usage.” Conference Call The Company will hold a live conference call and webcast at 4:00 p.m. central time on Wednesday, March 20, 2024, to discuss the Company's 2023 fourth quarter and full year results.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including without limitation statements regarding future financial results, improving supply chain management, the impact of new products and innovations on our customers' and our results, sales booking and backlog trends, customer demand, continued high performance of personnel, and industry revenue trends. While this release is based on management's best judgment and current expectations, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include, without limitation: (1) commodity cost increases coupled with challenges in raising prices and/or customer pressure to reduce prices; (2) supply chain disruptions leading to shortages of critical components; (3) volatility in market conditions which may affect demand for the Company's products; (4) increased competition; (5) changes in the reliability and efficiency of operating facilities or those of third parties; (6) risks related to the availability of labor; (7) the unanticipated loss of any key member of senior management; (8) geopolitical, economic, financial and business conditions; (9) the Company's ability to steadily improve manufacturing output and product quality throughout the remainder of 2024 or (10) the impact of global health epidemics on our customers, employees, manufacturing facilities, suppliers, the capital markets and our financial condition. Some of the above-mentioned factors are described in further detail in the section entitled ""Risk Factors"" in our annual and quarterly reports, as applicable. You should assume the information appearing in this document is accurate only as of the date hereof, or as otherwise specified, as our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may have changed since such date. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States and the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting such forward-looking statements. Reconciliation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measure EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management that we believe provides useful information to investors because it reflects ongoing performance excluding certain non-recurring items during comparable periods and facilitates comparisons between peer companies since interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization can differ greatly between different organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies. EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) plus interest expense, plus income tax expense plus depreciation expense and amortization expense. EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. It is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to revenue or net income, as applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other businesses. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical metric and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP.

Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Sadot Group Inc. (SDOT) reports a significant revenue increase to $726.7 million in 2023 from $161.7 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA improves to $0.1 million compared to a $2.0 million loss year over year. The company engages a third party to explore divesting its restaurant and food prep assets. Positive Revenue surged to $726.7 million in 2023 from $161.7 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA improved to $0.1 million from a $2.0 million loss year over year. The company's assets increased to $178.1 million in 2023 from $27.2 million in 2022. Cash balance decreased to $1.4 million in 2023 from $9.9 million in 2022 due to strategic shifts. Working capital rose to $8.3 million in 2023 from $4.0 million in 2022. Sadot Group is focusing on its Sadot Agri-Foods division and exploring divesting its restaurant operations. Engaged Lisiten Associates to explore potential divestment of restaurant and meal prep assets. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported revenue increase for Sadot Group Inc. from $161.7 million to $726.7 million marks a significant year-over-year growth, demonstrating the company's ability to scale operations, particularly within its Sadot Agri-Foods division. Such a dramatic rise in revenue often signals strong market demand and effective business strategy execution. However, the relatively flat adjusted EBITDA, moving from a $2.0 million loss to a marginal $0.1 million profit, suggests that while top-line growth is robust, the company is still in the early stages of achieving operational efficiency and profitability. This could be a concern for investors looking for sustainable profit margins.The strategic shift away from the restaurant business, indicated by the potential divestment of restaurant and food prep assets, is a clear realignment of the company's core focus towards agri-foods. This could streamline operations and reduce complexity, potentially leading to improved margins in the future. The engagement of Lisiten Associates to explore this divestment further suggests a proactive approach to capitalizing on the company's strengths and shedding less profitable or non-core segments. Investors might view this move as a positive step towards optimizing the business model for long-term value creation. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Sadot Group's pivot towards the agri-food sector reflects a strategic response to evolving consumer preferences and global food supply chain dynamics. The agri-food industry is known for its resilience and growth potential, especially considering global population growth and the increasing demand for food commodities. The company's acquisition of a farm and involvement in forward sales contracts could be seen as a move to secure its supply chain and capitalize on market trends. However, the significant deployment of cash reserves from $9.9 million to $1.4 million raises questions about liquidity and the company's ability to withstand market volatility or unexpected downturns.The increase in working capital from $4.0 million to $8.3 million is a positive indicator of the company's short-term financial health, suggesting improved capability to meet its immediate obligations. However, it is essential to monitor how the potential sale of the restaurant assets will affect the balance sheet and whether the proceeds will be used to bolster cash reserves or reinvested into the core agri-foods business. Agricultural Economist Analyzing the company's shift towards agri-foods from an agricultural economics standpoint, the timing of entering the market is critical. Given the recent start of the Sadot Agri-Foods division in late 2022, the division's contribution to net income is noteworthy. This suggests that the company has successfully leveraged market opportunities or achieved efficiencies in its commodity origination and trading activities. For stakeholders, the key will be to assess whether these early successes are due to favorable market conditions or sustainable competitive advantages.The acquisition of farm assets hints at vertical integration, which can offer control over supply and cost efficiencies. However, this strategy also comes with risks associated with agricultural production, such as exposure to weather events and commodity price fluctuations. Investors should consider the company's risk management strategies, such as crop insurance and diversification of commodity trades, to mitigate these risks. 03/20/2024 - 04:30 PM 2023 Revenue Rises to $726.7 million from $161.7 million in 2022Adjusted EBITDA Rises to $0.1 million vs. $2.0 million loss Year over YearEngages Third Party to Explore the Potential Divestment of its Restaurant and Food Prep AssetsFORT WORTH, TX / ACCESSWIRE / March 20, 2024 / Sadot Group Inc.

This is attributed to strategic initiatives such as the acquisition of the farm, accounts receivable related to trades, and forward sales contracts for future delivery.As of December 31, 2023, the Company had a cash balance of $1.4 million compared to a cash balance of $9.9 million as of December 31, 2022. This decline is a deliberate outcome of Sadot Group's strategic shift away from the restaurant business towards the Sadot Agri-Foods division. The deployment of cash is intrinsic to the Company's business model for generating revenue and margins.The Company is fully focusing on the Sadot Agri-Foods division as we have made the decision to explore alternatives including potentially divesting the Company of its restaurant operations which have had a material impact on earnings over the past year. The Company has engaged Lisiten Associates in New York, specialists in the sale of restaurant concepts, to explore the potential divestment of the Company's remaining restaurant and meal prep assets.""It has been a truly transformative first 16 months since Sadot Group refocused and retooled the organization to become an emerging player in the global food supply chain,"" stated Michael Roper CEO of Sadot group. ""Beginning with our initial focus on agri-commodity origination and trading, we have embarked on a journey of diversification and growth.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net loss, adjusted for depreciation, amortization, net interest (income) expense, income taxes, impairment expenses, stock-based consulting expense, derived from amounts presented in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Other Comprehensive Loss. We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, (collectively, the ""Non-GAAP Measures"") are useful metrics for investors to understand and evaluate our operating results and ongoing profitability because they permit investors to evaluate our recurring profitability from our ongoing operating activities.EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, have certain limitations, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under U.S. GAAP. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of any of the Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other issuers, because some issuers calculate certain of the Non-GAAP Measures differently or not at all, limiting their usefulness as direct comparative measures.The following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure, Net loss, and the calculations of the Net loss margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 $'000 $'000 Net loss (8,042) (7,962)Adjustments to EBITDA: Depreciation and amortization expenses 1,808 2,015 Interest expense, net 469 7 Income tax (benefit) / expense (15) 25 EBITDA (5,780) (5,915)Adjustments to Adjusted EBITDA: Impairment of intangible asset 811 347 Impairment of goodwill 828 - Other income (308) (46)Change in fair value of stock-based compensation (1,339) - Gain on debt extinguishment - (140)Warrant modification expense 958 - Gain on fair value remeasurement (1,491) - Stock-based consulting expenses 6,192 3,716 Adjusted EBITDA (129) (2,038)Adjusted EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interest 218 - Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Sadot Group, Inc. 89 (2,038) Gross Profit 9,931 4,392 Gross Profit attributable to Sadot Group, Inc. 10,149 4,392 Net loss Margin attributable to Sadot Group, Inc.

Positive GitLab acquires Oxeye, a cloud-native application security provider. The acquisition aims to enhance GitLab's SAST roadmap. Oxeye's capabilities will improve security scanning technology and provide actionable insights. The acquisition aligns with GitLab's commitment to delivering best-in-class performance to customers. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Negative None. Cybersecurity Expert The acquisition of Oxeye by GitLab signifies a strategic move to enhance GitLab's security offerings within its DevSecOps platform. The integration of Oxeye's cloud-native application security testing into GitLab's existing suite will address a critical need in the software development industry for comprehensive security solutions that can manage risks throughout the development lifecycle. This move is particularly pertinent given the increasing complexity of applications and the rapid shift to cloud-native architectures.By focusing on Static Application Security Testing (SAST), GitLab is targeting a foundational element of secure coding practices. SAST tools are essential in identifying potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase without executing the program. The acquisition's emphasis on reducing false positives and providing actionable insights is a significant advancement, as these are common pain points in SAST tools that can lead to inefficiencies in vulnerability management processes.The ability to trace vulnerabilities from 'code to cloud' suggests a more holistic approach to security, acknowledging that risks are not static and can evolve as the application moves through different stages of deployment. This capability will likely be a differentiator in the market, providing developers and security teams with a more dynamic and context-aware toolset. Market Analyst From a market perspective, GitLab's acquisition of Oxeye is indicative of the ongoing consolidation within the DevSecOps sector. As companies increasingly prioritize software security, the demand for integrated platforms that offer end-to-end security capabilities is growing. GitLab's move to acquire Oxeye could be seen as an effort to stay ahead of competitors by offering a more comprehensive solution.The acquisition may have a positive impact on GitLab's market positioning. Forrester's recognition of GitLab as a leader in integrated software delivery platforms underscores the company's strong standing in the industry. Enhancing their security capabilities could further solidify this position and potentially attract new customers looking for robust DevSecOps solutions.However, without the disclosure of financial terms, it's challenging to assess the immediate financial impact of this acquisition on GitLab's bottom line. Long-term, the integration of Oxeye's technology could lead to increased revenue through upselling to existing customers and attracting new ones, but it will be essential to monitor customer adoption and satisfaction rates post-acquisition. Investment Analyst The strategic acquisition of Oxeye by GitLab could have implications for investors, particularly in how it may affect GitLab's future revenue streams and market share. By enhancing their SAST capabilities and expanding their security portfolio, GitLab is addressing a growing segment within the software development market. This move could potentially increase GitLab's attractiveness to investors by showcasing the company's proactive approach to growth and adaptation to evolving market needs.Investors will be interested in how this acquisition will translate into GitLab's operational efficiency and whether it will lead to cost savings or improved margins through synergies. The lack of financial details makes it difficult to predict the immediate impact on GitLab's financial performance, but investors will likely look for indications of the acquisition's success in future earnings reports and updates on market share.It's also worth noting that the software security market is highly competitive, with many players vying for leadership. GitLab's ability to integrate Oxeye effectively and deliver on the promised enhancements will be critical in maintaining investor confidence and justifying the acquisition's value. 03/20/2024 - 04:45 PM Already recognized as the only Leader in Integrated Software Delivery Platforms by an independent research firm, GitLab’s DevSecOps platform combines best-in-class, robust security, governance, and AI/ML across the software development lifecycleSAN FRANCISCO, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- All Remote - GitLab Inc., ​​the most comprehensive AI-powered DevSecOps platform, today announced it has acquired Oxeye, the provider of an award-winning, cloud-native application security and risk management solution.

Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Nutanix files lawsuit against Tessell, alleging willful copyright and patent infringement, theft of source code and resources. Tessell founders, former Nutanix employees, accused of using Nutanix Era1 source code to develop their product. Nutanix seeks return of stolen IP, injunction, restitution, and damages, initiating arbitration proceedings as well. Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert In the realm of intellectual property law, the allegations made by Nutanix against Tessell are severe and carry significant legal implications. The intentional misappropriation of trade secrets, such as source code, can lead to substantial financial penalties and injunctive relief. The fact that the former employees are accused of not only stealing the code but also attempting to erase evidence, if proven, exacerbates the severity of their actions. The legal process will involve detailed examination of digital footprints and contractual obligations stemming from the employee agreements. The outcome of this case could set a precedent for how similar cases are handled in the tech industry, particularly regarding employee mobility and intellectual property rights. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the lawsuit filed by Nutanix could have notable repercussions on the company's market valuation. Intellectual property, especially in tech companies, is a cornerstone of their competitive advantage. If the allegations of theft are substantiated, it might signal vulnerabilities in Nutanix's internal controls, potentially impacting investor confidence. On the other hand, the aggressive action to protect its assets might be viewed positively, showcasing the company's commitment to safeguarding its intellectual property. The financial impact will also depend on the costs associated with the lawsuit and any potential settlement or restitution, which could affect the company's financials in the short to medium term. Market Research Analyst Understanding the market dynamics, the theft of source code from Nutanix, a significant player in the hybrid multicloud computing space, could have broader market implications. Source code is the lifeblood of software companies and its theft could lead to unfair competitive practices if used to accelerate a rival's product development. This incident may prompt other companies in the industry to re-evaluate their security measures and protocols for protecting intellectual property. Additionally, the lawsuit and subsequent arbitration proceedings will be closely watched by competitors, investors and customers alike, as they may influence market perceptions and trust in Nutanix's ability to protect its technological assets. 03/20/2024 - 04:37 PM Nutanix asserts willful copyright and patent infringement, including theft of Nutanix resources and its database service source code SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Nutanix (NASDAQ: NTNX), a leader in hybrid multicloud computing, today announced that it filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in San Jose, alleging that Tessell, Inc. engaged in willful copyright and patent infringement, including theft of Nutanix’s source code and intellectual property related to the Company’s database service offering. As alleged in the Federal complaint, Tessell’s founders include former Nutanix employees Bala Kuchibhotla, Kamal Khanuja, and Bakul Banthia. The complaint against Tessell alleges that, during their employment with Nutanix, these former employees covertly designed, built, demonstrated, and secured financing for the future Tessell product, using Nutanix source code, servers and other resources. The complaint alleges that they took Nutanix Era1 source code with them to Tessell, which used it. The complaint further alleges that they schemed to remove all indicia of Nutanix branding from their prototype, and then tried to cover their tracks by wiping their Nutanix laptops. Nutanix is seeking the return of its stolen intellectual property, an injunction to stop further infringement, restitution for the Nutanix resources taken by the three former employees for the founding of Tessell, and money damages in an amount to be proven. Nutanix also announced that it is commencing separate arbitration proceedings against the Tessell founders per their Nutanix employee agreements. “It has been shocking to learn of the behavior of these former employees during their employment, the scope of what they took from Nutanix, and the steps they took to hide their use of Nutanix resources to found their company,” said Tyler Wall, Chief Legal Officer at Nutanix. “Nutanix believes strongly in fair competition and its importance and value to the industry overall, and it is with deliberate and thoughtful consideration that we have decided to file this lawsuit. The facts that our investigation uncovered were egregious. We look forward to presenting our evidence and proving our claims in the litigation.” Nutanix believes in innovation, but stealing intellectual property and source code is not innovation. Nutanix does not have a history of suing companies or people. The facts found in this situation were too nefarious to ignore. Nutanix Database Service is a valued part of the Company’s product portfolio, and unfettered theft of its intellectual property and source code cannot go unaddressed. About Nutanix Nutanix is a global leader in cloud software, offering organizations a single platform for running apps and data across clouds.

CAAP maintains a strong cash position with cash & cash equivalents totaling $369.8 million. Net debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA improved to 1.4x as of December 31, 2023, down from 1.6x as of September 30, 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst The disclosed financial results of Corporación América Airports S.A. (CAAP) for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 demonstrate a noteworthy recovery trajectory when compared to pre-pandemic levels. The increase in passenger traffic nearing 99.1% of Q4 2019 levels is a significant indicator of the aviation industry's rebound. This recovery is further underscored by the 19% year-over-year (YoY) growth in consolidated revenues, excluding IFRIC12 and IAS29 adjustments, which is 37% above Q4 2019 figures. Such growth is pivotal for investor confidence as it reflects the company's ability to not only recover but also expand its revenue streams beyond pre-pandemic benchmarks.Adjusted EBITDA, a key metric for evaluating a company's operating performance, saw an increase to $332 million, including a substantial $167 million from the Natal friendly termination. While this one-time event has positively skewed the EBITDA, it's imperative to consider the underlying performance excluding this indemnification payment. The Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion to 92.9% from 37.4% in Q4 2022, even when normalized for the Natal impact, shows operational efficiency and cost control. The company's strong cash position and improved net debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio from 1.6x to 1.4x further indicate a robust balance sheet, which is important for future investments and expansion projects. Market Research Analyst CAAP's performance reflects broader trends in the global aviation sector, where passenger volumes are steadily approaching pre-COVID-19 levels. The 13.1% YoY growth in passenger traffic is a testament to the resilience of the travel demand, which is a positive signal for the industry at large. The company's strategic focus on expanding its airport network and leveraging the recovery in travel demand is evident from their ongoing negotiations and expansion projects in Italy, Armenia and Nigeria. The estimated investments of Euro 400 million in Firenze and approximately $400 million in Yerevan are indicative of CAAP's commitment to long-term growth.The company's diversified revenue streams, with a 22.6% increase in Aeronautical Revenues and an 8.1% increase in Non-Aeronautical Revenues ex-IAS29, show its ability to maximize both core and ancillary revenue sources. This diversification is critical for mitigating risks associated with fluctuations in passenger traffic and other industry-specific challenges. Legal and Regulatory Expert The application of Hyperinflation Accounting in Argentina, in compliance with IFRS rule IAS 29, has led to a $28.9 million Adjusted EBITDA reduction in CAAP's Argentina segment. This accounting practice is essential for providing a more accurate financial representation in hyperinflationary environments and is a critical consideration for investors analyzing the company's performance in such markets. The company's mention of having a natural hedge against currency devaluation, with the majority of Argentine revenues linked to the USD and approximately half of the costs in ARS, provides a layer of financial stability amidst currency fluctuations.Furthermore, the termination of the Natal airport concession agreement in Brazil, resulting in a significant indemnification payment, highlights the importance of understanding concession agreements' terms and potential financial implications. Such events can have material impacts on a company's financials and must be factored into the overall assessment of the company's health and prospects. 03/20/2024 - 04:31 PM Passenger traffic up 13% YoY reaching 99.1% of 4Q19 pre-pandemic levels Consolidated Revenues, ex-IFRIC12 and ex-IAS29, up 19% YoY and 37% above 4Q19 Adjusted EBITDA ex-IAS29 of $332 million includes $167 million from Natal friendly termination LUXEMBOURG--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Corporación América Airports S.A.

Adjusted EBITDA ex-IFRIC12 increased to $298.8 million, from $122.1 million in the year-ago period, or to $132.3 million when excluding the contribution from the aforementioned indemnification payment.

Operating Income of $540.6 million, up from $304.6 million in 2022. Operating income in 2023 includes a portion ($62.7 million) of the $166.5 million EBITDA contribution from the indemnification payment received in connection with the friendly termination of the Natal airport concession agreement, in Brazil. Adjusted EBITDA ex-IFRIC12 increased to $671.3 million, from $454.8 million in 2022, or to $504.8 million when excluding the contribution from the aforementioned indemnification payment. Excluding rule IAS 29 and the Natal impact, Adjusted EBITDA ex-IFRIC12 increased 39.9% to $635.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin ex-IFRIC12 expanded to 53.5% from 37.1% in 2022, or to 40.2% when excluding the Natal positive impact. Excluding both rule IAS 29 and the Natal impact, Adjusted EBITDA margin ex-IFRIC12 expanded to 41.2% from 36.9% in 2022. Strong cash position with Cash & cash equivalents totaling $369.8 million. Net debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA improved to 1.4x as of December 31, 2023, from 1.6x as of September 30, 2023. CEO Message Commenting on the results for the quarter Mr. Martín Eurnekian, CEO of Corporación América Airports, noted: “The strong momentum experienced throughout the year continued into the fourth quarter, with passenger traffic growing 13% year-on-year and revenue growth ex-IAS29 surpassing the increase in traffic. This resulted in a solid expansion in revenues per PAX, which was 5% higher than 4Q22 and 39% above pre-pandemic levels. Total costs and expenses grew in line with higher activity but below revenue growth, leading to Adjusted EBITDA growth of 29% YoY and 71% when compared to 4Q19. These financial highlights include two important impacts: First, due to the sharp devaluation of the Argentine peso last December, as reported figures included non-cash accounting impacts from applying hyperinflation accounting, in accordance with IFRS Rule IAS29, causing a $28.9 million Adjusted EBITDA reduction in our Argentina segment, which is not indicative of the underlying performance of our business. Importantly, as the majority of Argentine revenues are linked to the USD and approximately half of the costs are in ARS, we have a natural hedge against currency devaluation. Second, a key milestone this quarter was the successful conclusion of the friendly termination process of the Natal airport concession agreement, which benefited Adjusted EBITDA by $166.5 million. The net indemnification amount to CAAP was R$465 million. This good performance was underscored by strong momentum across all geographies and reflects our commitment to efficient execution and our ability to leverage the ongoing recovery in travel demand. Looking ahead, we remain focused on the approval processes in Italy and Armenia in connection with significant expansion projects in our airports in Firenze and Yerevan, respectively, which will foster growth and create value for our stakeholders. In Firenze, we are working on the approval of a new master plan that will include a new runaway with much longer reach and a larger new terminal. The total investment is estimated at Euro 400 million, of which Euro 150 million will be funded with government grants. In Yerevan, we remain in negotiations with the government to expand our Zvartnots Airport and enhance commercial offerings. The total investment plan is expected to be approximately $400 million. Keeping our focus on selectively expanding our airport network, we remain in negotiations with the government of Nigeria regarding the Abuja and Kano concession agreements while seeking additional expansion opportunities. Regarding market dynamics, we maintain a cautiously optimistic outlook on passenger traffic across our airport network. In sum, we are excited by the strength of our business and prospects ahead, underpinned by a robust balance sheet that positions us well for continued success as we navigate the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.” Operating & Financial Highlights (In millions of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted) 4Q23 as reported 4Q22 as reported % Var as reported IAS 29 4Q23 4Q23 ex IAS 29 4Q22 ex IAS 29 % Var ex IAS 29 Passenger Traffic (Million Passengers) 20.7 18.3 13.1% 20.7 18.3 13.1% Revenue 365.0 386.4 -5.5% -89.6 454.6 397.6 14.3% Aeronautical Revenues 164.0 165.7 -1.0% -45.1 209.1 170.5 22.6% Non-Aeronautical Revenues 201.0 220.7 -8.9% -44.5 245.5 227.1 8.1% Revenue excluding construction service 321.8 326.8 -1.5% -75.7 397.6 334.3 18.9% Operating Income / (Loss) 263.6 86.4 205.1% -41.5 305.1 104.7 191.3% Operating Margin 72.2% 22.4% 4985 0.0% 67.1% 26.3% 4076 Net (Loss) / Income Attributable to Owners of the Parent 130.7 12.1 977.3% 95.9 34.9 -7.6 -561.4% EPS (US$) 0.81 0.08 976.7% 0.60 0.22 -0.05 -561.2% Adjusted EBITDA 303.4 123.0 146.6% -28.9 332.3 125.4 164.9% Adjusted EBITDA Margin 83.1% 31.8% 5127 - 73.1% 31.5% 4154 Adjusted EBITDA Margin excluding Construction Service 92.9% 37.4% 5549 - 82.4% 37.2% 4518 Net Debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA 1.4x 2.4x - - - - - Net Debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA excl. impairment on intangible assets (1) 1.4x 2.4x - - - - - Note: Figures in historical dollars (excluding IAS29) are included for comparison purposes. 1) LTM Adjusted EBITDA excluding impairments of intangible assets.

Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenues. Adjusted EBITDA excluding Construction Service (“Adjusted EBITDA ex-IFRIC”) is defined as income for the period before construction services revenue and cost, financial income, financial loss, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA Margin excluding Construction Service (“Adjusted EBITDA Margin ex-IFRIC12”) excludes the effect of IFRIC 12 with respect to the construction or improvements to assets under the concession and is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA excluding Construction Service revenue and cost, by total revenues less Construction service revenue. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA excluding Construction Service and Adjusted EBITDA Margin excluding Construction Service are not measures recognized under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, consolidated net income for the year as determined in accordance with IFRS or as indicators of our operating performance from continuing operations. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information and should note that these measures as calculated by the Company, may differ materially from similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA excluding Construction Service enhances an investor’s understanding of our performance and are useful for investors to assess our operating performance by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA excluding Construction Service are useful because they allow us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods, capital structure or income taxes and construction services (when applicable). Net debt is calculated by deducting “Cash and cash equivalents” from total financial debt. Figures ex-IAS 29 result from dividing nominal Argentine pesos for the Argentine Segment, by the average foreign exchange rate of the Argentine Peso against the US dollar in the period. Percentage variations ex-IAS 29 figures compare results as presented in the prior year quarter before IAS 29 came into effect, against ex-IAS 29 results for this quarter as described above. For comparison purposes, the impact of adopting IAS 29 in Aeropuertos Argentina 2000, the Company’s largest subsidiary in Argentina, is presented separately in each of the applicable sections of this earnings release, in a column denominated “IAS 29”. The impact from “Hyperinflation Accounting in Argentina” is described in more detail page 25 of this report. Definitions and Concepts Commercial Revenues: CAAP derives commercial revenue principally from fees resulting from warehouse usage (which includes cargo storage, stowage and warehouse services and related international cargo services), services and retail stores, duty free shops, car parking facilities, catering, hangar services, food and beverage services, retail stores, including royalties collected from retailers’ revenue, and rent of space, advertising, fuel, airport counters, VIP lounges and fees collected from other miscellaneous sources, such as telecommunications, car rentals and passenger services. Construction Service revenue and cost: Investments related to improvements and upgrades to be performed in connection with concession agreements are treated under the intangible asset model established by IFRIC 12. As a result, all expenditures associated with investments required by the concession agreements are treated as revenue generating activities given that they ultimately provide future benefits, and subsequent improvements and upgrades made to the concession are recognized as intangible assets based on the principles of IFRIC 12. The revenue and expense are recognized as profit or loss when the expenditures are performed. The cost for such additions and improvements to concession assets is based on actual costs incurred by CAAP in the execution of the additions or improvements, considering the investment requirements in the concession agreements. Through bidding processes, the Company contracts third parties to carry out such construction or improvement services. The amount of revenues for these services is equal to the amount of costs incurred plus a reasonable margin, which is estimated at an average of 3.0% to 5.0%.

Carmell Sharpens Aesthetics Focus with Execution of Definitive Agreement to Sell Axolotl Biologix Subsidiary,2024-03-20T20:39:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Carmell  (Nasdaq: CTCX) announced the sale of its subsidiary, Axolotl Biologix, to the initial sellers for shares and notes worth $8 million. The move allows the company to focus on skincare products launch, following the acquisition of AxoBio in August 2023. The sale is expected to improve Carmell's financial position significantly.","Carmell Sharpens Aesthetics Focus with Execution of Definitive Agreement to Sell Axolotl Biologix Subsidiary Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Carmell (Nasdaq: CTCX) announced the sale of its subsidiary, Axolotl Biologix, to the initial sellers for shares and notes worth $8 million. The move allows the company to focus on skincare products launch, following the acquisition of AxoBio in August 2023. The sale is expected to improve Carmell's financial position significantly. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The divestiture of Axolotl Biologix by Carmell Corporation represents a strategic realignment of the company's business focus. The transaction's structure, involving a mix of common and preferred shares along with notes payable, is indicative of a non-cash deal designed to minimize immediate cash outflows. This move is particularly noteworthy as it suggests a pivot towards high-margin aesthetic products, which typically have shorter development cycles and can be brought to market more rapidly than clinical-stage products.From a financial perspective, the reduction in annualized cash burn and debt, coupled with the increase in tangible equity, could be seen as positive indicators for Carmell's financial health. The reduction in earnings per share (EPS) dilution is also a critical factor, as it implies that existing shareholders will experience less dilution of their ownership stakes. However, the market's reception to such structural changes will depend on the success of the newly launched skincare products and the company's ability to achieve near-term profitability. Market Research Analyst Exiting the tissue graft space and entering the skincare market represents a significant shift in Carmell's business strategy. The skincare industry is highly competitive, with a strong emphasis on brand recognition and consumer loyalty. The successful addition of Key Opinion Leaders to Carmell's Scientific Advisory Board can be a valuable asset in gaining credibility and traction in this new market segment.Moreover, the establishment of a direct-to-consumer sales channel and backend logistics platform indicates Carmell's commitment to modern retail strategies, which are increasingly important in the beauty and personal care industry. The ability to effectively market and distribute products online is a key determinant of success in this sector. The impact of these strategic moves on Carmell's market share and revenue growth will be closely monitored by investors and industry analysts alike. Legal Expert The sale of AxoBio back to its initial sellers after a relatively short period of ownership raises questions about the due diligence and strategic planning undertaken during the initial acquisition. The legal complexities of such a transaction, including the transfer of stocks, preferred shares and notes payable, require careful consideration to ensure compliance with securities regulations and to protect shareholder interests.Additionally, the realignment of the Board of Directors and the discontinuation of certain clinical trials may have legal implications, particularly if there were prior commitments or expectations set with investors. It is essential that these corporate governance changes are transparent and justifiable to maintain investor confidence and avoid potential legal challenges. 03/20/2024 - 04:39 PM PITTSBURGH, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Carmell Corporation (Nasdaq: CTCX), a bio-aesthetics company focused on skin and hair health (“Carmell”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”), today announced the execution of a definitive agreement to sell its wholly owned subsidiary, Axolotl Biologix (“AxoBio”) to the initial sellers of AxoBio for 3,845,337 shares of Carmell common stock, 4,243 shares of Carmell preferred stock and notes payable to the initial sellers in the aggregate amount of $8 million. “The sale of AxoBio enables our exit from the tissue graft space thereby facilitating a sharper organizational focus on the launch of our skincare products beginning in March 2024 and continuing over Summer 2024,” said Rajiv Shukla, Chief Executive Officer of Carmell. In August 2023, Carmell acquired AxoBio for $65 million, which consisted of unsecured promissory notes in the aggregate amount of $8 million and $57 million in CTCX common and preferred stock (8.09 million fully diluted shares at $7.05 per share) issued by Carmell to the initial sellers. AxoBio’s product portfolio consists of a commercial-stage amnion graft for use in clinics, a pre-commercial stage hospital use product, and pre-clinical and clinical stage products under development. In September 2023, the Company announced the appointment of Mr. Rajiv Shukla as CEO to lead a drive towards near-term profitability and re-positioning as a bio-aesthetics company, that included the following initiatives: Focus on high-margin programs in aesthetics with shorter paths to commercialization.Discontinuation of clinical trials with budgeted spend of more than $20 million over 3 years.Expected cost savings of nearly $3 million per annum from organizational restructuring.Re-alignment of Carmell’s Board of Directors. In November 2023, Carmell announced the addition of new Independent Directors: Dr. Gilles Spenlehauer, the former Worldwide Head of Advanced Research at L’Oreal, the world’s biggest cosmetics company, and Mr. Scott Frisch, who currently serves as Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of AARP, the nation’s largest nonprofit organization serving 100+ million people ages 50 and older. In January 2024, Carmell announced the addition of several Key Opinion Leaders in the Aesthetics industry to their Scientific Advisory Board and commenced clinical product testing. The Company also completed commercial-scale manufacturing testing at its in-house clean room facility in Pittsburgh, PA. In preparation for commercial launch, the Company also implemented a fully functional direct-to-consumer online sales channel along with a backend logistics platform, an electronic Quality Management System and Oracle NetSuite ERP. In February 2024, Carmell announced completion of product development of its Gold Limited Edition Exclusive (G.L.E.E.) product, Carmell’s first aesthetic product, for commercial launch in March 2024. Following G.L.E.E. launch, Carmell plans to launch 9 other skincare products that are in advanced stages of development and slated for launch through Summer 2024. Following the sale of AxoBio, Carmell’s financial position is expected to improve as follows: $4 million drop in annualized cash burn (net of revenue) based on AxoBio’s actual January 2024 financials.$15.6 million reduction in debt: $7.6 million of AxoBio subsidiary level debt plus $8 million note payable related to the AxoBio acquisition.$7 million increase in tangible equity due to elimination of AxoBio’s negative tangible equity.29% reduction in EPS dilution due to the return of 8.09 million CTCX common shares on a fully diluted basis. After closing, Carmell will have 19.25 million common shares outstanding. About CarmellCarmell is a bio-aesthetics company that utilizes the Carmell SecretomeTM to support skin and hair health.

AZZ Inc.

Announces Successful Completion of Term Loan B Refinancing in Leverage-Neutral Transaction Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary AZZ Inc. successfully reprices its existing $980 million Term Loan B, reducing the interest rate margin by 50 basis points to SOFR + 325 basis points, resulting in annual interest savings of approximately $5 million. This marks the second repricing, leading to total interest rate margin savings of 100 basis points since May 2022. The company aims to lower its net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio to 3.0 times or lower by the end of 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The repricing of AZZ Inc.'s Term Loan B is a strategic financial maneuver that indicates the company's proactive approach to debt management. By securing a 50 basis point reduction in the interest rate margin, the firm not only decreases its interest expenses by an estimated $5 million annually but also signals to the market its improved creditworthiness and operational efficiency. This move could be perceived positively by investors, as it suggests that the company has sufficient cash flow to negotiate better terms with lenders and it is focused on optimizing its capital structure.Furthermore, the fact that this repricing does not affect the loan's covenants or maturity implies that AZZ Inc. maintains its financial flexibility while reducing costs. The cumulative 100 basis point reduction since the initial issuance of the loan reflects a substantial cost-saving initiative. However, it's important for stakeholders to consider the company's ability to continue generating sufficient earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to support its target leverage ratio, especially in an environment where interest rates are generally rising. Debt Market Analyst AZZ Inc.'s successful repricing of its Term Loan B is a testament to the current conditions of the debt markets and the company's negotiation capabilities. The reduction in the interest rate margin by 50 basis points above the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) is a significant achievement, particularly in a market that has experienced volatility in interest rates. This adjustment could potentially make AZZ's debt more attractive to debt investors looking for stable returns in a risk-adjusted manner.It's also worth noting that the company's disciplined approach to reducing its net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio is a prudent step that may enhance its long-term financial stability. Investors should monitor the company's leverage ratio closely, as it is a critical indicator of the company's ability to service its debt. A target leverage ratio of 3.0 times or lower is quite ambitious and achieving it could further solidify investor confidence in the company's fiscal prudence. Market Research Analyst The strategic financial decision by AZZ Inc. to reprice its Term Loan B can have broader implications for its competitive position in the hot-dip galvanizing and coil coating industry. The annual interest savings of $5 million could potentially be redirected towards capital investments, research and development, or other areas that could enhance the company's market share and operational capabilities. Additionally, this financial maneuver may place AZZ in a more favorable position compared to competitors who may be grappling with higher interest expenses or less favorable loan terms.Understanding the industry dynamics, such as the demand for galvanizing and coating solutions and the capital intensity of the industry, is important for evaluating the long-term impact of such financial decisions. If AZZ manages to leverage these savings effectively, they could accelerate growth and innovation, leading to further business expansion and potentially positive performance in the stock market. 03/20/2024 - 04:30 PM FORT WORTH, Texas, March 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AZZ Inc. (NYSE: AZZ), the leading independent provider of hot-dip galvanizing and coil coating solutions in North America, today announced the successful repricing of AZZ's currently existing $980 million Term Loan B due May 13, 2029. The repricing reduces the interest rate margin on the Term Loan B by 50 basis points to SOFR + 325 basis points resulting in annual interest savings of approximately $5 million per year. Philip Schlom, Chief Financial Officer commented, ""We are pleased to announce the successful completion of our Term Loan B refinancing once again. We achieved a 50-basis point reduction in our Term Loan B borrowing rate with no change to our leverage, covenants, or maturity date. This is the second such repricing AZZ has completed, resulting in interest rate margin savings of 100 basis points in total since issuing the Term Loan B in May 2022.

These additions will enhance Transavia's fleet operations, building on the success of the first ALC A321neo delivered in December 2023. Positive None. Negative None. Aerospace Industry Analyst The announcement of Air Lease Corporation's long-term lease agreements with Transavia for two new Airbus A321-200neo aircraft is a strategic move that reflects the ongoing demand for fuel-efficient, narrow-body aircraft in the commercial aviation market. The A321neo model, known for its lower operational costs and reduced environmental footprint, is becoming a staple in modernizing fleets, thus potentially increasing Air Lease Corporation's competitive edge in the aircraft leasing industry.From a financial perspective, the addition of these aircraft to the lease portfolio can be expected to generate stable, long-term revenue streams for Air Lease Corporation. The deal also signifies confidence in the A321neo's marketability, which could influence the company's stock performance positively. However, investors should be mindful of the capital expenditures involved in acquiring these aircraft and the associated risks, such as potential market saturation with the A321neo model and the reliance on airline clients' financial health. Financial Analyst The lease of additional aircraft to Transavia may indicate Air Lease Corporation's robust relationship with the airline, which can be seen as a positive signal to investors about the company's ability to maintain and expand its client base. Moreover, the delivery timeline set for late 2025 and early 2026 provides a clear future revenue outlook, which is important for financial planning and forecasting.Investors should consider how these leases affect the company's asset utilization and debt levels. While the expansion of the fleet can enhance earnings and market share, it's also essential to balance this with the financial leverage and interest obligations that come with aircraft financing. The impact of this news on the stock market will likely be assessed by investors based on the terms of the lease agreements, the anticipated demand for air travel during the delivery period and the overall health of the aviation sector. Environmental Sustainability Analyst The Airbus A321-200neo aircraft are part of a newer generation of planes designed with eco-efficiency in mind. The 'neo' stands for 'new engine option,' which incorporates advanced technologies to reduce fuel burn and CO2 emissions. This aligns with the broader industry trend towards sustainability and could enhance Air Lease Corporation's reputation as a forward-thinking player in the leasing market.For stakeholders concerned with environmental impact, this transaction may reflect positively on Air Lease Corporation's commitment to supporting airlines in their transition to more sustainable operations. However, it is important to evaluate the full life cycle of these aircraft, including manufacturing and eventual decommissioning, to understand the comprehensive environmental impact. The long-term benefits of operating newer, more efficient aircraft could be a selling point for airlines looking to improve their sustainability profiles, potentially leading to more business for Air Lease Corporation. 03/20/2024 - 04:31 PM LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Today Air Lease Corporation (NYSE: AL) announced long-term lease agreements for two new Airbus A321-200neo aircraft with Transavia. Confirmed to deliver in late 2025 and early 2026, these two new Airbus A321-200neos join seven A321-200neos ALC has leased to Transavia.

(NASDAQ: BEAT), a medical technology company focused on transforming cardiac care through the power of personalized insights, has reported its financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter & Subsequent 2024 Operational Highlights The company made steady progress toward key clinical and regulatory milestones on its AIMIGo™ 3D VECG system. AIMIGo 510(k) submission: The 510(k) submission for the AIMIGo system is currently being reviewed by the FDA. The initial AIMIGo 510(k) submission is focused on the credit card-sized 3D VECG device, patient application, physician portal and wireless communication among the elements. This is the cornerstone submission for HeartBeam and will be the basis of future submissions. The company currently anticipates clearance by the end of Q2 2024. 12 Lead Synthesis Software submission: HeartBeam has held two pre-submission meetings with FDA on the planned second AIMIGo 510(k) submission, which is focused on the algorithms that synthesize a 12 lead ECG from the 3D VECG signals. This application will be submitted after the initial clearance of the 3D VECG System. The emphasis of the pre-submission meetings was on the performance goals of the VALID-ECG clinical study (Clinical Validation of the AIMIGo 12-Lead ECG Synthesis Software for Arrhythmia Detection) that will demonstrate the similarity between the synthesized 12L ECG and a standard 12L ECG. The company enrolled the first patients in the VALID-ECG pivotal study, with enrollment expected to be completed in Q2 2024. Prior to initiating the VALID-ECG study, HeartBeam completed an 80-patient pilot study using the same protocol as the VALID-ECG study. Other highlights: Recently received two new patents on core vectorelectrocardiography (VECG) technology from the US Patent and Trademark Office, expanding intellectual property footprint to over 35 issued, allowed, and pending patents worldwide. Unveiled the AI program, including the addition of new leadership and advisory roles. The program is designed to deliver unprecedented personalized cardiac insights to its proprietary VECG technology. Data on the deep learning algorithm will be presented at two prestigious electrophysiology conferences in April and May of this year. Cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $16.2 million as of December 31, 2023, enabling the Company to execute on upcoming clinical and regulatory milestones. Anticipated cash runway extends into early 2025. Management Commentary “We have continued to make steady progress on regulatory and clinical milestones for the AIMIGo 3D VECG technology platform,” said Branislav Vajdic, PhD, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of HeartBeam. “We have filed a 510(k) submission to the FDA for our AIMIGo VECG device system. When cleared, this will be a major milestone for the company, as we expect this to be the first patient-held 3D VECG to be cleared by the FDA. Additionally, this clearance is the cornerstone of our regulatory efforts as it will be the basis for future FDA submissions, including our planned second FDA application on the system’s ability to synthesize a 12L ECG. We continue to anticipate that our limited launch of AIMIGo will occur by the end of 2024. “Based on feedback from the FDA and our clinical experts, we designed the VALID-ECG clinical study, a prospective single-arm multicenter trial with the goal to validate the AIMIGo 12L ECG Synthesis Software by comparing its results with those of a standard FDA-cleared 12L ECG using both quantitative and qualitative assessment methodologies. We recently enrolled the first patients, with a plan to enroll a total of approximately 198 adult patients. We anticipate completion of enrollment in the VALID-ECG study in Q2 2024 and submission of the second 510(k) application by Q3 2024. We also previously completed an 80-patient pilot study using the same protocol as the VALID-ECG study. Based on the pilot results, we initiated the VALID-ECG study. “During the fourth quarter, we announced significant developments related to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) applied to our VECG technology. By leveraging AI to analyze our data-rich signals, we believe we will be able to improve diagnostic accuracy and extract unique information that today’s ambulatory ECGs are unable to detect, such as complex heart rhythms, subtle signs of deteriorating heart health and cardiac events that may have previously been missed. This presents a unique opportunity to create a comprehensive repository of data that could unlock personalized AI-driven insights to improve cardiac care. Our team includes world class AI experts in previous positions with Google, Apple and Microsoft. In addition, two abstracts on our deep learning algorithm have been accepted for presentation at scientific meetings in April and May of this year. Importantly, we continued expanding our intellectual property footprint, recently receiving two new patents on our VECG technology.” “We ended the fourth quarter of 2023 with approximately $16.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. We are using cash at a lower rate than anticipated, and believe we are in a strong position as we carefully manage spending, which we believe will extend our cash runway into early 2025. We look forward to providing updates on our progress in the months ahead,” concluded Dr. Vajdic. Fourth Quarter & Full Year 2023 Financial Results Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $2.0 million, compared to $1.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2022.

Despite challenges, the company expanded partnerships, launched new technologies, and remains optimistic for future growth.","OmniAb Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results and Business Highlights Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary OmniAb, Inc. (NASDAQ: OABI) reported financial results for Q4 2023 and full year 2023, highlighting revenue decreases, increased R&D expenses, and net losses. Despite challenges, the company expanded partnerships, launched new technologies, and remains optimistic for future growth. Positive OmniAb expanded its partnership base and pipeline programs in 2023. Revenue for Q4 2023 was $4.8 million, down from $35.3 million in Q4 2022. Research and development expenses increased to $14.8 million in Q4 2023. General and administrative expenses decreased to $7.9 million in Q4 2023. Net loss for Q4 2023 was $14.1 million compared to net income of $6.8 million in Q4 2022. Full year 2023 revenue was $34.2 million, down from $59.1 million in 2022. Research and development expenses for 2023 increased to $56.5 million. General and administrative expenses for 2023 rose to $33.3 million. Net loss for 2023 was $50.6 million compared to $22.3 million in 2022. OmniAb expects its 2024 operating expenses to be similar to 2023. Cash provided by operating activities in 2023 was $2.3 million. The company signed 10 new licenses in 2023 and launched two new technologies, OmniDeep™ and OmnidAb™. OmniAb had 77 active partners and 325 active programs as of December 31, 2023. The Company's new technologies aim to enhance therapeutic discovery and antibody development. Recent partner highlights include positive results for various clinical trials and advancements in antibody development. OmniAb was added to the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (NBI) in Q4 2023. Negative Revenue decreased in Q4 and full year 2023 compared to the previous year. Net losses increased significantly in 2023. Research and development expenses saw a notable increase in 2023. General and administrative expenses also rose in 2023. Financial Analyst The financial results reported by OmniAb, Inc. indicate a significant revenue decrease from $59.1 million in 2022 to $34.2 million in 2023, primarily attributed to lower milestone payments from the commercial sale of TECVAYLI® and service revenue reductions. This decline in revenue, paired with increased research and development expenses, has led to a substantial net loss increase from $22.3 million in 2022 to $50.6 million in 2023. The company's financial guidance for 2024 suggests stable operating expenses and cash use, with optimism for reduced cash use in 2025 based on the progression of partnered pipeline projects.From an investment perspective, the sharp decline in revenue and increased net loss year-over-year could raise concerns about the company's near-term profitability. However, the company's cash position of $87.0 million and the expectation of sufficient capital to fund operations for the foreseeable future may provide some assurance to investors. The expectation of decreased cash use in 2025 is potentially promising, indicating that the management anticipates their investments in R&D to start yielding more financially viable results. The stock market typically reacts to earnings reports and these financial results could influence investor sentiment and the company's stock price. Biotechnology Market Analyst OmniAb's strategic expansion in its partnership base and pipeline programs, with 10 new licenses signed in 2023 and the introduction of two new technologies, OmniDeep™ and OmnidAb™, reflect the company's commitment to innovation and growth in the biotechnology sector. The entry of six new OmniAb-derived antibodies into the clinic underscores the company's productive R&D activities, despite the reported increase in R&D expenses.For stakeholders in the biotech industry, the development and commercialization of new therapeutic technologies like OmniDeep™ and OmnidAb™ could be significant. These technologies aim to enhance drug development efficiency, which could lead to a competitive advantage in the long term. The report of 77 active partners and 325 active programs, with 32 in clinical development or commercialization, suggests a robust pipeline that could eventually translate into revenue growth. This is particularly relevant for investors looking for companies with a strong R&D foundation and potential for future marketable products.However, the current financial performance and the substantial net loss may overshadow the strategic advancements, at least in the short term. Investors and market analysts will closely monitor the progression of clinical trials and the potential for these new technologies to translate into successful market products that could drive future revenue growth and improve financial health. Medical Research Analyst The clinical advancements of OmniAb's partners, such as Immunovant's positive results for batoclimab in Graves’ disease and the progression of global Phase 3 clinical trials, are critical milestones in the company's collaborative efforts. The potential of IMVT-1402 as a best-in-class neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor (FcRn) inhibitor, as well as the approval of sugemalimab in China for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, highlight the impact of OmniAb's technologies in the medical field.From a medical research perspective, the progression of these clinical programs is a positive indicator of the company's R&D capabilities and the therapeutic potential of its antibody discovery platforms. The advancement of these programs towards later-stage clinical trials and potential commercialization could lead to significant improvements in patient care and treatment options. This progress could eventually result in revenue generation through milestones and royalties, which would be a critical factor in offsetting the company's current R&D expenses and reducing future cash burn.Investors with a focus on the biopharmaceutical sector often look for companies with strong pipelines and innovative technologies that address unmet medical needs. The clinical achievements and regulatory approvals mentioned could be indicative of the company's potential to meet these investor expectations in the long term, despite the current financial losses reported. 03/20/2024 - 04:05 PM Conference Call with Slides Begins at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time Today EMERYVILLE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- OmniAb, Inc. (NASDAQ: OABI) today reported financial results for the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2023, and provided operating and partner program updates. “2023 was a year of significant expansion of OmniAb's partnership base and pipeline programs as we continued to execute against our plan, while key partner programs made significant progress despite last year's sector-related headwinds. Partners exceeded our expectations regarding the number of new programs entering the clinic, with a total of six new entrants last year,” said Matt Foehr, Chief Executive Officer of OmniAb. “In addition, we successfully launched two new technologies and expanded our business development function, now with a presence in the U.S., EU and Asia Pacific. We look forward to meaningful advancements in 2024 and in the coming years, as we are now staffed and resourced to efficiently leverage the future growth of the business.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $4.8 million, compared with $35.3 million for the same period in 2022, with the decrease primarily due to the recognition of a $25.0 million milestone payment in the prior-year period related to the first commercial sale of TECVAYLI® (teclistamab) in the U.S. and lower service revenue as a result of the completion of discovery work on certain ion channel programs.

Research and development expense for 2023 was $56.5 million, compared with $48.4 million for 2022, with the increase primarily due to headcount and facility costs. General and administrative expense for 2023 was $33.3 million, compared with $24.9 million for 2022, with the increase primarily due to higher personnel costs and expenses related to being an independent publicly traded company. Net loss for 2023 was $50.6 million, or $0.51 per share, compared with a net loss of $22.3 million, or $0.26 per share, for 2022. Cash provided by operating activities was $2.3 million for 2023. As of December 31, 2023, OmniAb had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $87.0 million. 2024 Financial Guidance OmniAb expects operating expense in 2024 to be approximately the same as in 2023, and is now staffed and resourced to leverage the future growth of the business. OmniAb expects its cash use in 2024 to be relatively similar to its cash used in 2023, excluding the $35 million TECVAYLI milestone payment received in 2023. Given the expected progression of the existing partnered pipeline, OmniAb expects its cash use in 2025 to be substantially lower than in 2024. OmniAb’s current cash balance and cash from operations are expected to provide sufficient capital to fund operations for the foreseeable future. Fourth Quarter 2023 and Recent Business Highlights The Company signed 10 new licenses in 2023, including three in the fourth quarter, with Enable Life Sciences, Mirador Therapeutics, and a global pharma company. In addition, six new OmniAb-derived antibodies entered the clinic in 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the company had 77 active partners and 325 active programs, including 32 OmniAb-derived programs in clinical development, or being commercialized. OmniAb launched two new technologies during 2023 including OmniDeep™ and, during the fourth quarter, OmnidAb™. OmniDeep is a suite of in silico tools for therapeutic discovery and optimization that are woven throughout OmniAb’s various technologies and capabilities. These tools include structural modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, large multi-species antibody databases, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning models and more. OmniDeep facilitates rapid identification of candidates with the right affinity, specificity and developability profiles intended to make drug development more effective and efficient. The OmnidAb transgenic chicken novel host system builds upon the success of the Company’s OmniChicken® legacy by expressing an optimized single-domain human framework that can generate modular building blocks well suited to support a variety of therapeutic modalities. OmnidAb antibodies target distinct epitopes and have favorable developability profiles with high expression levels in mammalian cells. Compared with traditional antibodies, sdAbs produced by OmnidAb chickens have a compact format that opens new opportunities and broad clinical applications. Fourth quarter 2023 and recent partner highlights include the following: Batoclimab Immunovant reported positive initial results for batoclimab in Graves’ disease (GD). The company announced that results from the initial cohort of patients in an ongoing 24-week Phase 2 clinical trial meaningfully exceeded a 50% response rates. Immunovant also reported that global Phase 3 clinical trials of batoclimab in myasthenia gravis (MG) and thyroid eye disease (TED) are progressing and on track for topline data in the second half of 2024 (MG) and the first half of 2025 (TED). Initial period 1 data from the Phase 2b clinical trial of batoclimab in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) are expected in the second or third quarter of 2024. IMVT-1402 Immunovant announced initial data from the 600 mg multiple-ascending-dose cohort of a Phase 1 clinical trial of IMVT-1402 in healthy adults. The results show that four subcutaneously administered doses of 600 mg produced a mean IgG reduction similar to high-dose batoclimab, but with minimal changes in albumin and LDL-C similar to those in placebo, confirming the potential of IMVT-1402 as a best-in-class neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor (FcRn) inhibitor. In addition, Immunovant announced plans to initiate four to five potentially registrational programs for IMVT-1402 over the next fiscal year. The company also plans on initiating trials in 10 indications for IMVT-1402 over the next two fiscal years. Acasunlimab (formerly GEN1046) Genmab expects to announce additional acasunlimab (GEN1046: PD-L1 x 4-1BB) Phase 2 data in second-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the first half of 2024. In addition, Genmab plans to initiate a Phase 3 study of acasunlimab in a second-line NSCLC indication in 2024. JNJ-79635322 Johnson & Johnson presented preclinical data for JNJ-79635322, a trispecific antibody comprised of an anti-CD3 binding domain, an anti-BCMA binding domain and an anti-GPRC5D binding domain, concluding that it is a potential first-in-class trispecific antibody with the ability to deplete dual- and single-target expressing multiple myeloma clones in preclinical studies in vitro and in vivo. A Phase 1 dose-escalating study of JNJ-79635322 in myeloma patients is ongoing. Zimberelimab Arcus and Gilead have reprioritized the joint domvanalimab + zimberelimab development program to focus on advancing, and potentially accelerating, the Phase 3 studies of STAR-121 (lung cancer) and STAR-221 (gastrointestinal cancer), which are both expected to be fully enrolled by year-end 2024. The companies also plan to initiate STAR-131, a new registrational Phase 3 lung cancer study that includes the domvanalimab + zimberelimab regimen. Arcus presented preliminary data from the dose-escalation portion of its ARC-8 Phase 1/1b study, evaluating the safety and tolerability of AB680 + NP/Gem + zimberelimab in metastatic pancreatic cancer. The results included a 41% objective response rate observed to-date across the first four cohorts in the Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of ARC-8, comparing favorably to the current standard of care. Sugemalimab CStone announced the National Medical Products Administration of China (NMPA) has approved the supplemental BLA for sugemalimab (Cejemly®) in combination with fluorouracil and platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment of unresectable locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Sugemalimab becomes the world's first anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody approved for this indication in the first-line setting.

Oncology Medical Research Analyst The acquisition of Fusion Pharmaceuticals by AstraZeneca represents a significant strategic move within the oncology sector, particularly in the development of radiopharmaceuticals. The premium paid by AstraZeneca underscores the high potential AstraZeneca sees in Fusion's pipeline, especially for FPI-2265, which targets a form of prostate cancer that has limited treatment options post-PLUVICTO™ therapy. The deal not only provides immediate shareholder value but also hints at AstraZeneca's confidence in the regulatory approval and commercial success of FPI-2265, as evidenced by the contingent value right (CVR) tied to regulatory milestones.From a research and development perspective, the transaction could accelerate the development of Fusion's pipeline through AstraZeneca's resources and expertise. The focus on FPI-2265's development for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients, a condition with a significant unmet medical need, could lead to a substantial market opportunity. The initiation of the Phase 2/3 registrational program and the upcoming presentation of the TATCIST study data at AACR are critical steps that will offer insights into the drug's efficacy and safety profile.Moreover, the operational capacity of Fusion's GMP manufacturing facility to produce clinical doses of FPI-2265 is a technical advantage that could streamline the path to market, assuming successful trial outcomes. Such manufacturing capabilities are essential for the specialized production of radiopharmaceuticals, which require strict adherence to quality standards due to the use of radioactive materials. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the acquisition of Fusion Pharmaceuticals by AstraZeneca at a significant premium is a noteworthy event that reflects the growing interest and investment in targeted alpha therapies (TATs) within the pharmaceutical industry. The deal valuation suggests that the market for precision oncology, particularly in treatments like radiopharmaceuticals, is expanding and becoming increasingly competitive.The strategic importance of Fusion's portfolio, including FPI-2265, is highlighted by its potential to tap into the mCRPC market, which is experiencing a dynamic shift with the introduction of novel therapies. The premium paid by AstraZeneca also indicates the expected revenue generation and market share capture that Fusion's assets could deliver in the long term. The CVR component of the deal aligns the interests of both companies towards successful regulatory outcomes, further emphasizing the high stakes involved in the development of FPI-2265.For investors, the acquisition news is a positive signal, as it not only offers an immediate return on investment but also reflects the industry's confidence in the future of radiopharmaceuticals. The clear strategy outlined by Fusion for advancing its clinical programs and the upcoming data presentations could serve as catalysts for the stock performance of both companies in the short term. Financial Analyst Examining the financial aspects of the acquisition, the offer of $21.00 per share plus a $3.00 CVR by AstraZeneca places a significant premium on Fusion's stock, which is indicative of a bullish stance on the potential of Fusion's radiopharmaceuticals. The deal's structure, with an upfront cash payment and a CVR, balances immediate liquidity for shareholders with the potential for future gains tied to regulatory success, effectively sharing the risk between the acquiring and acquired companies.The transaction value of approximately $2.4 billion, including contingent payments, is substantial and reflects the expected value creation from Fusion's pipeline. Fusion's strong financial position, with over $247 million in cash and investments as of the end of 2023, provides AstraZeneca with additional liquidity and financial stability post-acquisition. This financial health is also indicative of Fusion's ability to fund its operations well into 2025, reducing immediate financial risk for the acquirer.Investors should note the potential impact on AstraZeneca's financials, including the immediate cash outlay and the implications of the CVR payments. The latter will depend on FPI-2265's progress through the regulatory pathway, which adds an element of risk but also potential reward to the acquisition. The operational synergies and the potential for cost savings post-acquisition could also contribute to the overall financial rationale behind the deal. 03/20/2024 - 04:05 PM Company recently announced definitive agreement to be acquired by AstraZeneca FPI-2265 Phase 2/3 registrational program for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) expected to begin in Q2 2024 Interim data from TATCIST study of FPI-2265 to be presented at the 2024 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting in April Fusion is now producing and shipping clinical doses of FPI-2265 from its state-of-the-art GMP manufacturing facility HAMILTON, ON and BOSTON, March 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Fusion Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Portfolio Update FPI-2265: A 225Ac based radiopharmaceutical targeting prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) for the treatment of patients with mCRPC. In January 2024, the Company announced alignment with the FDA on its Phase 2/3 protocol for FPI-2265 in patients with mCRPC with progressive disease who have previously been treated with a 177Lu-based PSMA radiotherapy. The development plan includes a Phase 2 dose optimization lead-in, which aims to evaluate whether there are added safety and/or efficacy benefits of various dosing regimens in comparison to the validated regimen of 100kBq/kg every eight weeks, expected to be initiated in the second quarter of 2024. This Phase 2 portion is expected to complete enrollment of approximately 60 patients by the end of 2024. Following analysis of the Phase 2 data and an end of Phase 2 meeting to determine the recommended Phase 3 dosing regimen with the FDA, a Phase 3 global registrational trial in approximately 550 patients is expected to begin in 2025.The TATCIST trial, which began as an investigator sponsored study, is designed to evaluate FPI-2265 in patients with mCRPC with progressive disease, including patients who are naïve to PSMA-targeted radiopharmaceuticals and those who have been pre-treated with 177Lu-based PSMA radiopharmaceutical therapy, completed target enrollment of 25-30 patients. The Company announced that interim data will be presented at the upcoming 2024 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting in April.The Company is also pursuing the opportunity to potentially move this therapeutic candidate into earlier lines of treatment with combinations of FPI-2265 and olaparib. Fusion expects to initiate a combination trial in the first half of this year.FPI-1434: Targeting insulin growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R). In January 2024, Fusion announced encouraging early findings from Cohort 2 in the cold/hot dosing arm of the ongoing Phase 1, multi-center, open-label clinical trial. The trial is designed to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of FPI-1434 in patients with solid tumors expressing IGF-1R. The trial is also designed to establish the maximum tolerated dose for FPI-1434 and the recommended Phase 2 dose. No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed to date in the 25 kBq/kg dose cohort. Two out of three patients completed the DLT period, and one pancreatic cancer patient discontinued treatment due to disease progression. Evidence of anti-tumor activity was observed in a heavily pre-treated patient with Ewing sarcoma after a single dose and a second patient receiving four cycles of therapy demonstrated stable disease as best response.The Company plans to complete and further evaluate results from Cohort 2 and hold a Safety Review Committee (SRC) meeting to evaluate the emerging data. Fusion plans to share more details on the data and the FPI-1434 development program in mid-2024.FPI-2059: Targeting neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1). Patient enrollment and dosing is ongoing in the Phase 1, multi-center, open-label clinical trial designed to investigate the safety, tolerability, dosimetry, biodistribution, and pharmacokinetics of FPI-2059 as well as preliminary anti-tumor activity in participants with NTSR1 expressing advanced metastatic solid tumors. Fusion plans to provide guidance on timing for pharmacokinetic, imaging and safety data following early experience with FPI-2059 patient screening and enrollment. FPI-2068: A bispecific IgG-based targeted alpha therapy (TAT) targeting EGFR-cMET. FPI-2068 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 study and is being jointly developed with AstraZeneca under the companies' multi-asset collaboration agreement. FPI-2068 is a bispecific IgG-based TAT designed to deliver actinium-225 to various solid tumors that express EGFR-cMET. EGFR and cMET are both validated targets that are co-expressed in multiple tumor types, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The investigational new drug (IND) application has been cleared and Fusion is currently activating clinical trial sites.Other Recent Updates In January 2024, Fusion announced it had completed validation of its state-of-the-art GMP manufacturing facility and produced the first clinical dose of a TAT. The facility, which has clinical and commercial scale manufacturing capacity, is designed to support the Company's growing pipeline of TATs and is expected to be capable of producing more than 100,000 doses per year.In February 2024, Fusion announced that it has entered into a licensing agreement with Heidelberg University and Euratom represented by the European Commission, Joint Research Centre (together, the ""Licensors"").

The patent covers SneakPeek Snap® products until 2040, ensuring accuracy in testing by reducing DNA contamination in maternal blood samples.","Myriad Genetics Announces Patent Granted for SneakPeek® Snap Device Rhea-AI Impact (High) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Myriad Genetics, Inc. announced the grant of a patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for push-button blood collection devices for fetal sex determination. The patent covers SneakPeek Snap® products until 2040, ensuring accuracy in testing by reducing DNA contamination in maternal blood samples. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent patent grant to Myriad Genetics for the use of push-button blood collection devices in PCR-based fetal sex determination is a significant milestone in the field of genetic testing and precision medicine. This innovation simplifies the process of collecting blood samples for consumers, which could lead to increased adoption rates of at-home testing kits. The convenience factor, paired with the improved accuracy of the test due to minimized risk of contaminating DNA, may result in a competitive advantage for Myriad Genetics in the prenatal testing market.From a medical research perspective, the ability to reliably determine fetal sex early in pregnancy using a simple capillary blood sample could have implications for the management of sex-linked genetic disorders. It also highlights a trend towards non-invasive testing methods, which are generally favored due to their lower risk profiles compared to invasive procedures. The protection of this technology until 2040 suggests a long-term strategic positioning that could influence R&D investments and collaborations within the industry. Market Research Analyst The patent for SneakPeek Snap products until 2040 provides Myriad Genetics with a significant period of market exclusivity in the United States. This exclusivity is likely to contribute positively to the company's market share and revenue growth. The potential for licensing the technology to other device suppliers indicates an additional revenue stream and may enhance the company's influence over the supply chain for these devices.Furthermore, the demand for non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is expected to grow, driven by a global increase in awareness about genetic disorders and the importance of early detection. Myriad Genetics' patent could position them as a frontrunner in this expanding market. However, it is important to monitor how competitors respond, whether through the development of alternative technologies or through legal challenges to the patent's validity. Financial Analyst The financial implications of this patent grant for Myriad Genetics are multifaceted. On one hand, the exclusivity until 2040 for SneakPeek Snap products can safeguard the company's market position and potentially justify a premium pricing strategy. On the other hand, the company must be prepared to capitalize on this opportunity by scaling production and distribution to meet the anticipated demand.Investors should consider the costs associated with defending the patent, potential R&D expenses for further product enhancements and the investment needed to expand market reach. The announcement of the patent might have a positive short-term impact on the stock price due to perceived future growth, but the actual financial performance will depend on effective execution of the company's strategic initiatives and the market's reception of the product. 03/20/2024 - 04:05 PM SALT LAKE CITY, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Myriad Genetics, Inc., (NASDAQ: MYGN), a leader in genetic testing and precision medicine, today announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has granted a patent that covers the use of push-button blood collection devices for PCR-based fetal sex determination.

Preparing to publish study results in premier medical publications. Enhancing product pipeline with PreTRM sample collection and assay improvements. Engaged in commercial activities to boost PreTRM adoption in 2024-2025. Initiatives to build awareness and develop patient-facing products and predictive analytics tools. Revenue growth expected from commercial expansion and new product launches. Negative Decline in Q4 2023 revenue compared to the same period in 2022. Net loss reported for Q4 2023 and full year 2023. Increase in research and development expenses for 2023 due to higher clinical study costs. Financial Analyst The reported financials of Sera Prognostics Inc. indicate a mixed landscape. While revenue has seen a marginal increase year-over-year, the company's operating expenses have decreased significantly. This suggests that the company's efforts to streamline operations and focus its commercial strategy are yielding some cost-saving results. However, the reduction in expenses has not yet translated into profitability, as evidenced by the net loss figures. The company's cash reserves are substantial, which provides a buffer for continued R&D and commercial activities. It is essential to monitor how these financial dynamics play out in the context of the company's strategic initiatives, especially with the expected launch of new product enhancements and commercial expansion. Medical Research Analyst The recommendation from the DSMB to stop enrollment in the PRIME study due to efficacy is a significant milestone. It suggests that the study's co-primary endpoints have been met, which could potentially lead to a paradigm shift in maternal and neonatal health management. The focus on developing patient-facing products and predictive analytics tools indicates a strategic move towards personalized healthcare. For stakeholders, the successful validation and launch of these products could mean diversifying revenue streams and potentially improving patient outcomes. However, the real-world effectiveness of these tools and their market adoption will be critical factors in assessing the long-term impact on the company's financial health. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Sera Prognostics is positioning itself in a niche but vital segment of healthcare. The advancements in their product pipeline and the strategic push towards direct engagement with expectant mothers could tap into unmet needs within the maternal health space. The focus on enhancing the PreTRM® test and making it more accessible suggests that Sera is aiming to increase market penetration. Nevertheless, successful commercialization will depend on the receptiveness of the medical community, insurance coverage and the ability to effectively communicate the value proposition to both healthcare providers and patients. Tracking competitor activities and market trends will be essential in evaluating the potential for Sera's revenue growth and market share expansion. 03/20/2024 - 04:05 PM SALT LAKE CITY, March 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Sera Prognostics Inc., The Pregnancy Company® (Nasdaq: SERA), focused on improving maternal and neonatal health by providing innovative pregnancy biomarker information to doctors and patients, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.

Sera Prognostics is a leading health diagnostics company dedicated to improving the lives of women and babies through precision pregnancy care. Sera's mission is to provide early, pivotal pregnancy information to improve the health of mothers and newborns, resulting in reductions in the costs of healthcare delivery. Sera has a robust pipeline of innovative diagnostic tests focused on the early prediction of preterm birth risk and other complications of pregnancy. Sera's precision medicine PreTRM® Test reports to a physician the individualized risk of spontaneous premature delivery in a pregnancy, enabling earlier proactive interventions in women with higher risk. Sera Prognostics is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. About Preterm Birth Preterm birth is defined as any birth before 37 weeks' gestation and is the leading cause of illness and death in newborns. The 2023 March of Dimes Report Card shows that, for the last five consecutive years, more than one in ten infants is born prematurely in the United States. Prematurity is associated with a significantly increased risk of major long-term medical complications, including learning disabilities, cerebral palsy, chronic respiratory illness, intellectual disability, seizures, and vision and hearing loss, and can generate significant costs throughout the lives of affected children. The annual health care costs to manage short- and long-term complications of prematurity in the United States were estimated to be approximately $25 billion for 2016. About the PreTRM® Test The PreTRM® Test is the only broadly validated, commercially available blood-based biomarker test that provides an early, accurate and individualized risk prediction for spontaneous preterm birth in asymptomatic singleton pregnancies. The PreTRM® Test measures and analyzes proteins in the blood that are highly predictive of preterm birth. The PreTRM® Test permits physicians to identify, during the weeks 18 through 20 of pregnancy, which women are at increased risk for preterm birth and its complications, enabling more informed, personalized clinical decisions based on each woman's individual risk. The PreTRM® Test is ordered by a medical professional.

Xerox Holdings Corporation Announces Closing of Senior Notes Offering,2024-03-20T20:05:00.000Z,Low,Negative,Xerox Holdings  (XRX) closes a $500 million private placement of 8.875% Senior Notes due 2029 to refinance existing debt and for general corporate purposes.,"Xerox Holdings Corporation Announces Closing of Senior Notes Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Xerox Holdings (XRX) closes a $500 million private placement of 8.875% Senior Notes due 2029 to refinance existing debt and for general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Xerox Holdings Corporation's recent closure of a $500 million senior notes offering at an 8.875% interest rate reflects a strategic financial move aimed at restructuring its debt profile. This high-interest rate, significantly above current corporate bond rates for companies with stable credit ratings, suggests a market perception of increased risk associated with Xerox's debt. Investors should note that the proceeds are earmarked for refinancing existing obligations, which may improve the company's debt maturity schedule and potentially alleviate short-term liquidity pressures.However, the decision to refinance at a higher rate could indicate that the company is facing challenges in generating cash flow or that its creditworthiness has been downgraded. The impact of this debt restructuring on Xerox's financial health will depend on the balance between the interest savings from retiring the 2024 and 2025 notes and the additional interest burden due to the higher rate of the new issuance. Stakeholders should monitor the company's future earnings reports for improvements in interest coverage ratios and overall debt levels. Debt Market Analyst The issuance of senior notes by Xerox Holdings Corporation in a private placement suggests a targeted approach to debt financing, avoiding the public markets which could have demanded even higher yields or shown tepid interest. The choice of a private placement typically allows for faster execution and potentially more favorable terms from institutional investors who have a better understanding of the company's risk profile.It is also noteworthy that these notes are unsecured, placing them lower in the hierarchy of claims compared to secured debt in the event of a default. This placement, therefore, signals confidence on the part of the investors in Xerox's ability to meet its obligations. The use of proceeds to manage other outstanding indebtedness is a common strategy to manage the debt portfolio actively, but it will be critical to observe how this reshuffling impacts the overall cost of capital for Xerox and whether it aligns with the company's long-term strategic financial planning. 03/20/2024 - 04:05 PM NORWALK, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Xerox Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ: XRX) (the “Company”) announced today the closing of its $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 8.875% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Notes”) in a private placement to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”) and non-U.S. persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Act.

The redemption of preferred units is a strategic financial decision, often indicating a company's cash flow position and capital structure optimization. By redeeming these units at $25.00 each, the company is likely aiming to reduce its cost of capital, as preferred units typically carry higher dividend rates compared to debt. Investors holding these units will need to reassess their portfolios, as the redemption will result in the cessation of quarterly distributions these instruments offer. The accrued distribution of $0.4750 per unit until the redemption date provides a clear exit payment, which could be seen as a positive for current holders. However, for long-term investors relying on the steady income from these distributions, this move might necessitate looking for alternative income-generating investments.From a broader perspective, this could signal Energy Transfer's confidence in its liquidity and financial stability. The company's extensive energy asset portfolio and strategic positioning across major U.S. production basins suggest a robust business model capable of generating sufficient operational cash flow to manage such redemptions without hindering its growth trajectory. Energy Market Analyst Energy Transfer LP's redemption of its Series E Preferred Units should be viewed within the context of the energy sector's dynamics. The energy infrastructure industry, characterized by its extensive capital requirements, often utilizes various financing instruments, including preferred units, to support its growth and operations. Energy Transfer's move might reflect an industry-wide trend where companies are restructuring their capital to better align with the current low-interest-rate environment.Given Energy Transfer's diversified portfolio and presence across 44 states, this redemption aligns with the company's strategic focus on optimizing its asset base. The redemption could be a precursor to reallocating capital towards higher growth areas or deleveraging the balance sheet, which is often well-received by the market. Additionally, the company's ownership stakes in Sunoco LP and USA Compression Partners, LP, provide it with additional strategic levers to manage its capital allocation effectively.For stakeholders and potential investors, the redemption action serves as an indicator of Energy Transfer's proactive capital management. It is essential to monitor the company's subsequent investment decisions, as these will shape its competitive position in the evolving energy landscape, particularly in the context of the energy transition and the increasing importance of sustainable energy infrastructure. 03/20/2024 - 04:05 PM DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Energy Transfer LP (NYSE: ET) today issued a notice to redeem all of its outstanding Series E Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units (the “Units”) on May 15, 2024 at a redemption price per Unit of $25.00.

Negative Delisting of multiple companies' securities due to suspension on Nasdaq. Negative impact on the affected companies and their shareholders. Potential repercussions on the companies' market value and investor confidence. Market Research Analyst The delisting of multiple companies from the Nasdaq stock market is a significant event that can have a ripple effect across the investment community. Delisting often occurs when a company fails to meet the exchange's financial and regulatory requirements, which can include maintaining a minimum share price, filing periodic financial reports, or having a sufficient number of publicly-held shares.From a market perspective, these delistings could indicate underlying economic trends or sector-specific issues. Investors and analysts may interpret the concentration of delistings in a particular industry as a sign of distress within that sector. For instance, if a majority of the delisted companies are from the healthcare sector, this could suggest regulatory challenges or funding difficulties in that space.Furthermore, delistings can impact investor sentiment, as they may decrease confidence in the market's stability. This can lead to increased volatility as investors re-evaluate their portfolios and consider the implications of companies failing to meet listing standards. Financial Analyst For individual companies, delisting from a major exchange like Nasdaq is a significant financial event. It often leads to reduced visibility and liquidity, as the securities move to over-the-counter (OTC) markets where they may be traded less frequently and at lower volumes. This can result in a wider bid-ask spread, making it more difficult for shareholders to sell their positions without experiencing a significant loss.Companies that are delisted also face challenges in raising capital since being on a major exchange is often seen as a stamp of approval that can attract institutional investors. Without this, companies may have to rely on alternative financing methods, which are typically more expensive and can dilute existing shareholders' value.The announcement of a delisting can also have immediate and direct effects on a company's stock price, often causing a sharp decline as investors react to the negative news. Shareholders of these companies should closely monitor the situation and understand the potential for increased risks and lower liquidity. Legal Expert Delisting proceedings are a legal process governed by the exchange's rules and the regulatory framework of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Companies facing delisting are usually provided with an opportunity to appeal the decision or to come into compliance with the listing requirements. The transparency of this process is important for maintaining trust in the financial markets.Companies that are delisted due to non-compliance with financial reporting have a legal obligation to continue to provide information to investors, even if they are traded OTC. This is important for maintaining a fair market where investors have access to the information needed to make informed decisions.Moreover, the legal implications of delisting can extend to potential class-action lawsuits if shareholders feel that the company's management has failed to uphold their fiduciary duties. This can lead to additional scrutiny and potential legal costs for the delisted entities. 03/20/2024 - 04:05 PM NEW YORK,, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Nasdaq Stock Market announced today that it will delist the common stock and warrants of Latch, Inc.

The increase in R&D expenses is indicative of the company's commitment to advancing its clinical trials, which could lead to long-term value creation if the trials prove successful. However, the immediate impact is a higher burn rate, which investors must weigh against the company's $83.0 million cash position and expected cash runway into 2026. The financial health of Trevi is critical for sustaining its operations without the need for additional capital raising in the near term, which could dilute existing shareholders.The reported net loss is remarkably stable year-over-year, suggesting a controlled expenditure despite increased clinical activities. The increase in other income, net, due to higher interest income and reduced interest expenses, partially offsets the R&D expenses, which is a positive takeaway for the financial stability of the company. Medical Research Analyst The progress in the clinical trials for Haduvio is a critical factor for Trevi Therapeutics' future prospects. The Phase 2a RIVER trial and the Phase 2b CORAL trial are pivotal in determining the efficacy and safety of Haduvio for treating chronic cough in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and refractory chronic cough (RCC). The successful completion and positive results from these trials could lead to a significant market opportunity, given the current lack of approved treatments in the U.S. for these conditions.The stratification of patients based on cough frequency in the RIVER trial is a strategic approach that may provide more nuanced data on Haduvio's efficacy. The sample size re-estimation in the CORAL trial will be an important event to ensure that the study is adequately powered to detect a treatment effect, which is important for regulatory approval and market confidence. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Trevi Therapeutics' focus on chronic cough, particularly in IPF and RCC, addresses a significant unmet medical need. The market potential for Haduvio, if approved, is substantial due to the lack of competition. The investor and analyst community will be closely monitoring the topline data expected in the second half of 2024, as positive results could lead to a reevaluation of the company's market value and growth prospects.Additionally, the company's engagement in upcoming healthcare conferences could provide further visibility and potentially attract investor interest. The presentation of Trevi's research and development progress at these events may also serve as a platform for potential partnerships or collaborations, which could further influence the company's stock performance and business trajectory. 03/20/2024 - 04:05 PM Reaffirms guidance for the Phase 2a RIVER trial of Haduvio in RCC patients with topline data expected in the second half of 2024 Enrollment progressing in the Phase 2b CORAL dose-ranging trial of Haduvio for the treatment of chronic cough in IPF patients Human Abuse Potential Study more than 50% enrolled Management to host a conference call and webcast today at 4:30 p.m. ET NEW HAVEN, Conn., March 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Trevi Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: TRVI), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing the investigational therapy Haduvio™ (oral nalbuphine ER) for the treatment of chronic cough in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and refractory chronic cough (RCC), today announced financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, as well as provided business updates. Trevi is expecting 2024 to be a milestone year with important data readouts in chronic cough in the second half""I am proud of the progress Trevi has made in 2023, with the initiation of clinical trials in the fourth quarter for RCC, chronic cough in IPF, and the final part of the Human Abuse Potential (HAP) study,"" said Jennifer Good, President and CEO of Trevi Therapeutics. ""All three of these trials are enrolling patients and we reaffirm our guidance to read out topline data in the second half of this year for the RCC trial and the HAP study. During this time, we also plan to complete and release the results of the sample size re-estimation (SSRE) for the chronic cough in IPF trial. We are expecting 2024 to be a milestone year of important data readouts in areas of chronic cough where there is a significant unmet need with no approved treatments in the United States."" Key Business Updates Phase 2a RIVER trial for the treatment of RCC, in which we expect to enroll approximately 60 patients, was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2023. Enrollment continues across multiple sites with the majority of sites being activated in the first quarter of 2024. Topline data is expected in the second half of 2024. The RIVER trial will measure overall results, as well as results from the 1:1 stratification between patients with 10-19 coughs/hour (moderate 24-hour cough frequency) and those with ≥ 20 coughs/hour (high 24-hour cough frequency). Phase 2b CORAL trial for the treatment of chronic cough in IPF, in which we expect to enroll approximately 160 patients, was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2023. This trial is expected to be conducted at multiple sites in up to 11 countries. The SSRE is expected to occur in the second half of 2024 when 50% of the patients are evaluable for the primary endpoint. Assuming no adjustments are made to the sample size, topline results are expected in the first half of 2025.The final part of the HAP study, in which we expect to enroll approximately 56 patients, initiated dosing and we continue to expect topline data in the second half of 2024. This study is over 50% enrolled.The Company ended 2023 with $83.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities with expected cash runway into 2026.Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Highlights Research and development (R&D) expenses: R&D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased to $6.5 million from $4.3 million in the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased clinical trial costs in our Phase 2b CORAL trial and our Phase 2a RIVER trial, both of which were initiated in the fourth quarter of 2023. General and administrative (G&A) expenses: G&A expenses were $2.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $2.3 million in the same period in 2022. Other income, net: Other income, net was $1.1 million in both the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022. Net loss: For the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company reported a net loss of $7.8 million, compared to a net loss of $5.5 million in the same period in 2022. Full-Year 2023 Financial Highlights R&D expenses: R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $23.7 million compared to $19.8 million in 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased clinical trial costs in our Phase 2b CORAL trial and our Phase 2a RIVER trial, both of which were started in 2023. Consultant services and personnel-related expenses in support of these studies also increased. These increases were partially offset by decreased clinical trial costs in our completed Phase 2b/3 PRISM and Phase 2 CANAL trials as well as decreased purchases of active drug substance. G&A expenses: G&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $10.2 million compared to $10.1 million in 2022. Other income, net: Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $4.8 million compared to $0.7 million in 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income due to higher cash equivalent and marketable securities balances, and higher interest rate yields. Contributing to the increase was a reduction in interest expense due to the early payoff of our SVB term loan in May 2023. Net loss: For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company reported a net loss of $29.1 million, compared to a net loss of $29.2 million in 2022.

Trevi is also developing Haduvio for prurigo nodularis. Haduvio is a dual ĸ-opioid receptor agonist and µ-opioid receptor antagonist that works both centrally in the brain as well as peripherally in the lungs and has the potential for a synergistic antitussive effect to treat chronic cough. The impact of chronic cough is significant and often leads to a decline in patients' social, physical, and psychological quality of life. In IPF, chronic cough may lead to worsening disease and may be associated with a higher risk of progression, death, or need for lung transplant. There are no approved therapies for the treatment of chronic cough in IPF and current treatment options provide minimal relief to patients. RCC affects up to 10% of the adult population, and Haduvio's expansion into RCC has the potential to reach patients suffering from moderate to severe chronic cough. There are also no approved therapies for RCC in the US. Parenteral nalbuphine is not scheduled by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. Trevi intends to propose Haduvio as the trade name for oral nalbuphine ER. Its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

Multiple patients to be dosed with VCAR33ALLO in the first half of 2024. Trem-cel and VCAR33ALLO clinical trial data expected in the second half of 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results from Vor Bio indicate a growing investment in research and development (R&D), with a year-on-year increase from $64.6 million to $94.3 million. This reflects the company's intensified efforts in advancing clinical trials and manufacturing processes, particularly for its AML treatments VCAR33ALLO and trem-cel. The increased R&D spending is a strategic move, aiming to bring innovative therapies to market, which could potentially lead to significant revenue streams upon successful commercialization.However, the reported net loss widening from $92.1 million to $117.9 million raises concerns about the company's current burn rate. Investors should monitor the cash runway, which is projected to last into the second half of 2025, against the timelines for clinical data readouts and potential FDA approvals. The financial health of Vor Bio will be closely tied to these milestones, as positive clinical results and subsequent approvals can greatly enhance the company's valuation and attract further investments. Medical Research Analyst The Fast Track and Orphan Drug Designations granted to VCAR33ALLO by the FDA are significant endorsements, expediting the development process and offering a period of market exclusivity upon approval. This could position Vor Bio advantageously in the competitive landscape of AML treatments, assuming the clinical trial data supports efficacy and safety. The unique approach of using transplant donor-derived lymphocytes for CAR-T cell therapy is noteworthy, as it could potentially offer enhanced anti-leukemia activity and patient outcomes compared to traditional therapies.For stakeholders, the upcoming clinical data readouts in the second half of 2024 are pivotal. Success in these trials could lead to a surge in investor confidence and a higher stock valuation. Conversely, any setbacks could have a detrimental impact on the company's financial position and stock price. Long-term, if Vor Bio's therapies prove effective, this could revolutionize treatment options for AML patients and create a new standard of care, substantially impacting the oncology market. Biotech Market Analyst AML remains an area with significant unmet medical needs and Vor Bio's focus on innovative CAR-T therapies places it within a high-growth potential market. The company's strategic approach to target both CD33 and CLL-1 antigens, coupled with its multiplex engineering of hematopoietic stem cells, indicates a forward-thinking stance that could differentiate it from competitors. These advancements could capture a sizable market share if the therapies are approved and commercialized.Investors should consider the broader impact of Vor Bio's pipeline on the biotech sector. Success could spur further investment in similar technologies and companies, while failure could cast doubt on the viability of similar approaches. The biotech industry often moves based on perceived potential and Vor Bio's progress or lack thereof will likely influence peer companies and the investment landscape. 03/20/2024 - 04:05 PM Trem-cel and VCAR33ALLO clinical trial data expected in the second half of 2024VCAR33ALLO granted Fast Track and Orphan Drug Designation by U.S. Food & Drug Administration Cash runway extends into second half of 2025 CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vor Bio (Nasdaq: VOR), a clinical-stage cell and genome engineering company, today reported financial results for the three-month period and full year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a business update. “We are very pleased with the foundational progress we made in 2023. Building on this, we expect 2024 to be an exciting year in which we demonstrate the Vor Bio approach to be instrumental in reducing the disease burden of AML, a devastating cancer where we desperately need effective treatment options,” said Dr. Robert Ang, Vor Bio’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Corporate Updates Multiple patients expected to be dosed with VCAR33ALLO in the first half of 2024; initial data anticipated in second half of 2024 VBP301, a Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label, first-in-human study of VCAR33ALLO, is a transplant donor-derived anti-CD33 CAR-T cell therapy for patients with AML who have relapsed following a standard-of-care or trem-cel transplant. The first patient was dosed in January 2024, and multiple patients are expected to be dosed in the first half of 2024. We anticipate initial data in the second half of 2024.The U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track Designation and Orphan Drug Designation to VCAR33ALLO. The FDA Fast Track process aims to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. Orphan Drug Designation entitles companies to development incentives including tax credits for clinical testing, prescription drug user fee exemptions and seven-year marketing exclusivity in the event of regulatory approval. VCAR33ALLO is manufactured from lymphocytes collected from the patient’s original transplant donor, generating a CAR-T cell therapy that is exactly matched to the recipient’s engrafted blood system. By using healthy transplant donor cells as the starting material to produce VCAR33ALLO, the CAR-T cells have a more stem-like phenotype, leading to greater potential for expansion, persistence, and anti-leukemia activity compared to a product derived from a patient’s own lymphocytes. VBP101 clinical trial of trem-cel enrolling steadily, with the next data readout expected in the second half of 2024 Dose escalation of Mylotarg to 1.0 mg/m2 has commenced with multiple patients now treated.Patients receiving a trem-cel transplant who become measurable residual disease (MRD) positive or relapse have the option to receive induction-course Mylotarg or VCAR33ALLO.The Company expects to report further engraftment and protection data from the VBP101 clinical trial in the second half of 2024.The latest data update from VBP101, the Phase 1/2a clinical study of trem-cel, was presented at the ASH Annual Meeting on December 10, 2023, showing primary neutrophil engraftment in all eight patients and hematologic protection from acute Mylotarg toxicity through repeat doses. Trem-cel is a shielded transplant in development for patients with AML, in which healthy transplant donor cells are genetically engineered by removing CD33, with the potential to enable targeted therapies such as Mylotarg and CD33-targeted CAR-T therapy post-transplant, while avoiding on-target toxicities. Continued progress on dual-targeted CAR-T and multiplex engineering approach The Company continues to make progress with a dual-specific CAR-T targeting CD33 and CLL-1, two of the most promising antigens in AML. This is being paired with a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) multiplex engineering approach, which could allow removal or modification of these two genes. The Company has demonstrated in vitro proof of concept for this approach. IND-enabling work is progressing for the Company’s dual-specific CAR-T with key in vivo proof-of-concept experiments underway. Upcoming Milestones Trem-cel clinical data update expected in the second half of 2024VCAR33ALLO clinical data update expected in the second half of 2024 Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results Cash Position: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $137.2 million as of December 31, 2023, which is projected to fund operations into the second half of 2025. Research & Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $20.9 million, compared to $17.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, and for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $94.3 million, compared to $64.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in R&D expenses was attributable primarily to an increase in clinical trial, manufacturing and personnel expenses, and the execution of our non-exclusive license agreement with Editas Medicine.General & Administrative (G&A) Expenses: G&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $7.2 million, compared to $7.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, and for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $31.7 million, compared to $28.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in G&A expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel expenses, including an increase in share-based compensation expense.Net Loss: Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $26.3 million, compared to $23.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, and for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $117.9 million, compared to $92.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Positive Positive topline results from Phase 1 study of RT-111 Successful oral delivery of Humira® in preclinical study Expansion of manufacturing and strategic program prioritization Upcoming milestones for RaniPill HC and RT-102 in 2024 Negative Decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities Increase in research and development expenses Increase in net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 Medical Research Analyst The recent announcement by Rani Therapeutics regarding the successful Phase 1 study of RT-111, an oral Anti-Interleukin 12/23 antibody, is a significant milestone in the field of drug delivery systems. The ability to transform injectable large molecules into oral pills could revolutionize the administration of biologics, potentially improving patient compliance and accessibility. The reported high bioavailability and safety profile underscore the potential of the RaniPill technology to disrupt the market, particularly for chronic conditions where long-term treatment adherence is essential.Furthermore, the preclinical pharmacodynamic data showing rapid weight loss in animal studies through the transenteric delivery of a GLP-1 incretin triagonist indicates the platform's versatility. This could open up new avenues for oral therapies in the treatment of obesity, a condition with a high prevalence and significant market demand for effective and convenient treatments.From a financial perspective, the strategic prioritization of key development programs and expansion of manufacturing capabilities, coupled with cost reduction initiatives, suggest a focused approach to managing resources. The extended cash runway into 2025 provides Rani Therapeutics with a buffer to continue their research and development efforts without the immediate pressure of fundraising. However, investors should monitor the progress of the RaniPill HC towards Phase 1 clinical trials and the initiation of the Phase 2 clinical trial of RT-102 for osteoporosis, as these milestones will be critical in determining the company's future trajectory and market potential. Financial Analyst Examining Rani Therapeutics' financial results, the decrease in cash reserves from $98.5 million to $48.5 million year-over-year raises questions about the company's burn rate and the sustainability of its operations. However, the anticipated cost savings and strategic program prioritization appear to be a proactive measure to extend the company's financial runway. The increase in research and development expenses aligns with the company's continued investment in its pipeline, which is essential for future growth.It is also noteworthy that the net loss has increased compared to the previous year, which is not uncommon for clinical-stage biotech companies focused on research and development. The stock-based compensation expense, a non-cash item, has also risen, which could be indicative of efforts to retain key personnel during this critical phase. Investors should consider the balance between the company's spending on development and the potential for these investments to yield approved products and generate revenue in the long-term. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The oral delivery of biologics represents a significant unmet need in the pharmaceutical industry. Rani Therapeutics' progress in this area, particularly with the RaniPill platform, positions the company in a potentially lucrative segment of the market. The oral delivery of drugs like Humira® through the RaniPill HC in preclinical studies suggests that the technology could be applied to a range of high-value biologics currently limited to injectable forms.The company's focus on diseases with large patient populations, such as obesity and osteoporosis, indicates a strategic targeting of markets with substantial growth opportunities. The successful translation of these technologies from preclinical to clinical stages and ultimately to market approval could capture significant market share. However, the competitive landscape, including the emergence of biosimilars and alternative drug delivery systems, should be carefully monitored as they may impact the company's positioning and pricing power. 03/20/2024 - 04:05 PM - Announced Positive Topline Results from Phase 1 Study of an Oral Anti-Interleukin 12/23 Antibody (RT-111) - - Announced Preclinical Pharmacodynamic Data on Transenteric Delivery of GLP-1 Incretin Triagonist - - Cash runway extended into 2025 - - Conference call and webcast today at 4:30 p.m. ET / 1:30 p.m. PT - SAN JOSE, Calif., March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rani Therapeutics Holdings, Inc.

(the “Company”) (OTCQX: OTTW), the holding company for OSB Community Bank (the “Bank”), announced today that the Company has appointed Mark D. Alcott to the Company’s and the Bank’s Boards of Directors pursuant to the terms of a standstill agreement (the “Agreement”) entered into with Stilwell Activist Fund, L.P., Stilwell Activist Investments, L.P., Stilwell Partners, L.P., Stilwell Value LLC, and Joseph Stilwell (collectively, the “Stilwell Group”). Under the terms of the Agreement, which will remain in effect until the completion of the Company’s 2026 Annual Meeting of Stockholders unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, the Company has agreed to, among other things, appoint Mr. Alcott to the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Bank, in the class of directors expiring at the Company’s 2026 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and similar class of the Bank board. In the event Mr. Alcott is unable to serve as a director of the Company and Bank, the Company and Bank will appoint a replacement director chosen by the Stilwell Group. Under the Agreement, provided that the Board of Directors determines that such action is consistent with its fiduciary duties, the Company will use commercially reasonable best efforts to repurchase, subject to the receipt of any required regulatory approvals and/or non-objections, at least five percent of the Company’s common stock annually for each of fiscal year 2024 and 2025. If the Company is unable to repurchase, for any reason, at least five percent of the then outstanding shares of Company common stock annually for either fiscal year 2024 or 2025, the Company will, promptly after the conclusion of that fiscal year, engage an investment banker to assist the Company’s Board of Directors in evaluating all reasonable alternatives for maximizing the value of the Company’s common stock. The Stilwell Group is the beneficial owner of 353,529 shares, or 13.9%, of the Company’s common stock. Prior to entering into the Agreement, the Stilwell Group had received regulatory approval to purchase up to 19.99% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock. During the term of the Agreement, the Stilwell Group will not, among other things: acquire additional shares of the Company’s common stock, sell or transfer Company common stock to a five percent holder or a party that upon such transfer would become a five percent holder; propose or seek to effect a sale, merger, recapitalization of reorganization or any other transaction that would constitute a change in control of the Company (a “Company Transaction”); publicly suggest that the Company should engage in a Company Transaction; seek to exercise any control or influence over the management of the Company or the Boards of Directors of the Company or the Bank; present to the Company, its stockholders or any third party any Company Transaction or give encouragement to propose a Company Transaction; solicit proxies in opposition to any recommendations or proposals of the Company’s Board of Directors or become a participant in any such proxy solicitation; submit or encourage the submission of any nomination for election as a director of the Company or any stockholder proposal for business at a meeting of the Company’s stockholders; join or participate in any agreement to act in concert with any other person holding Company common stock; join with or assist or make any statement in opposition with respect to any nominee to the Company’s Board of Directors nominated by the Company’s Board of Directors or join with or assist in supporting or endorsing any other nominee or any stockholder proposal that is opposed by the Board of Directors; vote for any nominee that has not been nominated by the Company’s Board of Directors; except in connection with the enforcement of the Agreement, initiate or participate in any litigation against the Company, Bank or its officers and directors, including any derivative action; advise, encourage or finance any activities which would circumvent the limitations of the Agreement; or request to be excused from the terms of the Agreement or publicly disclose any such intention. Mr. Alcott has agreed to similar restrictions under the Agreement, but may acquire shares of Company common stock. “We have been looking to add experienced members to serve on our Boards, particularly following several retirements from the Board. The Stilwell Group had previously submitted a notice of intent to nominate Mr. Alcott to the Company’s Board. After meeting with Mr. Alcott and discussing, among many things, his perspective on board service and prior bank board service, we are pleased to welcome him as a representative of our largest investor,” said Craig Hepner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Hepner continued, “As we have indicated previously, the Board remains committed to implementing capital management strategies to maximize stockholder value when possible. The Agreement we have entered into with the Stilwell Group is consistent with this strategy, and we intend to pursue the necessary approvals to execute share repurchase programs contemplated by the terms of the Agreement. However, as we have also explained, the ability to implement capital management strategies is dependent on a variety of factors, including the Bank’s ability to dividend sufficient funds to the Company to fund them, and the requisite receipt of required regulatory approval or non-objection to do so. The lower earnings and tighter liquidity that we have experienced in recent periods have limited the Bank’s ability to upstream funds to the Company. We continue to act on our strategies to improve earnings, liquidity and funding costs and with the goal of being in position to execute additional capital management strategies as soon as possible.” Mark Alcott stated, “I look forward to working with my new colleagues at the Company for the benefit of all stockholders.” About Ottawa Bancorp, Inc.

Despite revenue declines, the company saw improved order trends and gross margin performance. FGI remains focused on driving value creation for shareholders through its BPC strategy and expects above-market growth in 2024 with total revenue guidance of $115-128 million. Positive None. Negative Revenue declined by 2.6% in the fourth quarter and 27.5% for the full year 2023. Bath Furniture revenue decreased significantly due to demand weakness and a trade-down to lower-priced offerings. Net income remained relatively flat at $0.5 million for the fourth quarter. Despite the positive gross margin improvement, the company reported a slight decrease in GAAP net income compared to the prior year. The demand environment remains uneven, with industry forecasters predicting modest declines in home improvement industry spending in 2024. Market Research Analyst The financial results of FGI Industries Ltd. reflect a nuanced picture of the company's performance, with a mix of positive and negative developments. The reported increase in gross profit and gross margin indicates a strategic shift towards more profitable products, which is a positive sign for investors looking for long-term value creation. It is important to note that while total revenues have decreased, the company's focus on higher-margin offerings has paid off, leading to an improved bottom line.However, the decline in total revenues and the specific weakness in the Bath Furniture segment raise concerns about the company's ability to maintain sales growth in a challenging market environment. The market demand for home improvement products is forecasted to decline, which could pose risks to the company's revenue projections. Investors should closely monitor the company's ability to execute its BPC strategy and whether it can continue to generate above-market growth in the face of industry headwinds. Financial Analyst FGI's financial position, as indicated by the reported cash balance and liquidity, suggests a strong ability to fund its strategic objectives and potentially pursue M&A opportunities. The company's disciplined approach to capital deployment and its focus on organic growth are reassuring from a financial management perspective. The guidance for fiscal 2024, with expected increases in adjusted operating income and adjusted net income, reflects management's optimism about the company's growth trajectory.It is important for stakeholders to evaluate the reliability of these forecasts, given the current market challenges. The company's financial flexibility and strategic investments, if successful, may lead to a competitive advantage and improved shareholder value. Conversely, any missteps in execution or further market downturns could negatively impact the projected financial outcomes. Legal Expert FGI's disclosure of both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted net income and adjusted operating income, provides a more comprehensive view of the company's performance. The reconciliation between these measures is essential for transparency and allows investors to understand the underlying business performance without the distortion of non-recurring items.Investors should also be aware of the legal implications of the company's licensing agreements, such as the one mentioned for FlushGuard Overflow Technology. Such agreements can offer competitive advantages and contribute to revenue growth, but they also carry legal obligations and risks that the company must manage effectively. The success of these agreements could significantly influence the company's financial results and stock performance. 03/20/2024 - 06:03 PM EAST HANOVER, N.J., March 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- FGI Industries Ltd.

MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY ""While 2023 was a difficult year due to uneven demand trends and prolonged inventory de-stocking, we remained committed to executing on our strategic initiatives, and as a result, we finished the year on a positive note and are entering 2024 well positioned to deliver improved financial results,"" stated David Bruce, President and Chief Executive Officer of FGI. ""We saw improved order trends during the fourth quarter, due in large part to the investments we made in organic growth initiatives throughout the year, and we expect the order momentum to continue to build into 2024."" ""We experienced solid growth trends across most of our business portfolio during the fourth quarter owing to growing momentum from new programs, generally stable end market demand, and a normalization of inventory levels in the channel,"" noted Bruce. ""Each of our business segments showed year-over-year growth during the fourth quarter, other than Bath Furniture, which continues to be impacted by demand weakness and a trade down to lower-priced offerings. Total revenue ended down 2.6% in the fourth quarter."" ""Our continued strategic focus on higher margin products drove another quarter of strong gross margin improvement, with fourth quarter gross margin increasing 549 basis points to 29.2%, our highest quarterly gross margin as a public company,"" continued Bruce. ""As a result, gross profit increased 20.1% during the fourth quarter to $9.0 million. I am very pleased by the improved momentum exiting the year, and it is very exciting to see our investments in our BPC initiatives begin to pay off."" ""As we discussed on our first call as a public company almost exactly two years ago, we are committed to driving value creation for shareholders by executing on our long-term strategic plan, which is based on driving above market organic growth through a focus on our BPC (Brands, Products, Channels) strategy, enhanced margin performance, and efficient capital deployment,"" continued Bruce. ""We remained focused on our strategic plan during 2023, despite what was a very challenging operating environment, and I am very proud of all we accomplished during the year. From a commercial perspective we made important progress on several key initiatives that will help us drive above-market growth in the coming years, including the launch of several new products and expanded penetration with key customer partners in Sanitaryware, the introduction of value-priced offerings in Bath Furniture to address shifts in market demand, continued growth in our shower business, and significant expansion in the dealer network for our custom kitchen cabinetry business. I could not be more pleased by our gross profit margin performance during 2023, as we increased our full year gross margin by 788 basis points, despite the revenue declines, owing to our strategic focus on growing our higher margin product categories. Finally, we continued our discipled focus on capital deployment, as we reduced working capital usage and ended the year in a very strong financial position that will provide us the financial flexibility to pursue our strategic objectives."" ""We maintained our strict financial discipline during the quarter, resulting in a cash balance of nearly $7.8 million at the end of the fourth quarter, which combined with our borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $24.4 million,"" stated Perry Lin, Chief Financial Officer of FGI. ""We continue to believe the highest and best use of our capital is for internal investment and this will remain our priority in the near-term; however, we will also continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic M&A."" ""While inventory levels have largely normalized, the demand environment remains uneven, with several industry forecasters predicting modest declines in home improvement industry spending in 2024,"" continued Bruce. ""However, based on the growing momentum in our new programs and product launches under our BPC program, we expect to generate above-market growth in 2024. As a result, we are forecasting full year 2024 revenues of $115 million to $128 million, adjusted operating income of $2.8 million to $3.8 million and adjusted net income of $1.2 million to $2.0 million. While we made significant progress against our strategic initiatives during 2023, we remain focused on our plan and look forward to continued execution against our strategy in 2024,"" concluded Bruce. STRATEGIC UPDATE FGI intends to drive long-term shareholder value through the execution of its Brands, Products and Channel (BPC) strategy to drive organic growth, enhanced financial performance, and efficient capital deployment. Some of the accomplishments achieved during the fourth quarter of 2023 and the key priorities for 2024 are as follows: BPC Strategy: FGI has continued to invest in its BPC strategy despite the market challenges, which is expected to drive improved organic growth longer-term. Some of the key successes during the quarter were as follows:FGI recently announced it entered into a 5-year licensing agreement that will provide the Company access to an industry leading overflow toilet technology. The company will market this technology as FlushGuard Overflow Technology. During the fourth quarter, the Company was awarded product placements utilizing the FlushGuard technology at several large customers, including two of the largest commercial distributors in North America. FGI exhibited a new line of retail and commercial sanitaryware products featuring FlushGuard at the 2024 Kitchen & Bath Show.FGI continues to focus on its initiatives to expand geographically, with recently signed agreements providing entry into India, Eastern Europe, Australia, and the UK. In the UK, FGI landed its first new customer partners in 2023 and as recently as this past month, three new distributor partners in India.The Company continued to execute on recently announced awards, including its online shower door program for an existing large Canadian retail partner that commenced in June 2023, and the roll-out of FGI's industry leading shower wall program into as many as 300 locations of a large U.S. retailer. Both programs continue to ramp up and contributed to improved shower systems growth in the fourth quarter, and the programs are expected to further build momentum into 2024.During the third quarter, FGI announced it had initiated an in-store promotion with a large US retailer that did not previously carry any of the Company's sanitaryware products in an effort to lay the groundwork for future growth. Following a successful promotion, the Company was able to place several new sanitaryware SKUs with this retailer, which feature the new FlushGuard overflow technology.The premium Covered Bridge kitchen cabinetry brand added 203 new dealers during 2023, bringing the total active dealer count to 302 at the end of the year. FGI had a large display at the 2024 Kitchen & Bath show that showcased its Covered Bridge custom kitchen cabinetry line.Key priorities under the Company's BPC strategy for 2024 include the continued execution under recently launched programs, further expansion of sanitaryware products utilizing the new FlushGuard overflow technology, the launch of new value-priced bath furniture offerings to better address current market trends, new product launches in shower systems, and the introduction of Isla Porter, the Company's new digital custom kitchen cabinetry business.Enhanced Margin Performance: FGI generated fourth quarter gross margin of 29.2%, up from 23.7% in the same period last year owing to the ongoing mix shift to higher margin products. For the full year 2023, gross margin was 27.4%, up nearly 800 basis points from the 19.5% gross margin generated in the prior year. During 2024, FGI expects gross margin to remain consistent with the 27-28% gross margin generated during fiscal year 2023, with operating margin improvement driven by volume leverage.Efficient Capital Deployment: FGI will continue to prioritize capital deployment in support of organic growth opportunities, while continuing to evaluate strategic M&A opportunities. With total liquidity of $24.4 million at December 31, 2023, the Company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to fund its organic growth strategy.FOURTH QUARTER 2023 RESULTS Revenue totaled $31.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of 2.6% compared to the prior-year period, driven by continued end market demand weakness in the bath furniture market, partially offset by growth in the Sanitaryware, Shower Systems, and Other businesses. Sanitaryware revenue was $20.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, up 1.8% from revenue of $20.2 million in the prior-year period, as order patterns continued to normalize following the inventory de-stocking headwinds that plagued results over the last year. The pro channel is showing signs of improvement and new customer programs are also beginning to benefit results.Bath Furniture revenue was $2.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, a decline from revenue of $6.1 million in the prior-year period, as the bath furniture market continues to be impacted by macro headwinds and a trade-down to lower ticket products. FGI's product mix in bath furniture had been skewed to higher-end products, which was resulting in more pronounced weakness relative to the value-focused peers in the space. Based on the ongoing shift to more value-priced offerings, FGI is launching product offerings in the mid-tier category to better address current demand and has already won several key customer awards featuring the new bath furniture.Shower Systems revenue was $5.7 million during the fourth quarter, up 55.3% from revenue of $3.7 million last year. Recently launched programs are gaining momentum, including the online shower door program with a large Canadian retailer, and the shower wall systems roll-out at up to 300 locations of a large U.S. retailer with initial shipments that began in December.Other revenue, which consists primarily of the custom kitchen cabinetry business, was $2.1 million during the fourth quarter, up from $1.7 million last year. Revenue benefited from continued dealer growth and new product launches. The Company remains on track to launch its new kitchen cabinetry initiative in the first half of 2024.Gross profit was $9.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 20.1% compared to last year owing to strong growth in higher margin categories. As a result, fourth quarter gross margin improved to 29.2%, up 549 basis points from the prior-year period. In addition to the shift in revenue mix towards higher-margin products, gross margin also benefitted from lower logistics costs and the benefit of pricing actions taken during 2022. Operating income was $1.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, up from income of $1.0 million in the prior-year period. Operating income during the fourth quarter of 2023 included non-recurring expenses of $0.1 million for business expansion expense and non-recurring IPO-related compensation. Excluding these non-recurring expenses, adjusted operating income was $1.4 million during the fourth quarter. The improvement in operating income was a result of the increase in gross profit, partially offset by higher operating expenses related to growth investments. The Company continues to invest in its BPC growth strategy despite the recent revenue headwinds. The increase in operating expenses during the fourth quarter included marketing spend for the recently launched FlushGuard product line and expenses tied to new custom kitchen cabinetry business development opportunities. Despite the additional investment spending, operating margin was 4.0% during the fourth quarter, up from 3.2% in the same period last year. The Company reported GAAP net income of $0.5 million, or $0.05 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2023, slightly down versus net income of $0.7 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the same period last year. FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $7.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, total debt of $7.0 million and $16.6 million of availability under its credit facilities net of letters of credit. Combined with cash and cash equivalents, total liquidity was $24.4 million at December 31, 2023. FINANCIAL GUIDANCE FGI believes the long-term outlook for the repair and remodel markets remains attractive, and the Company continues to be encouraged by the progress achieved on its organic growth initiatives through the BPC strategy. While inventory de-stocking headwinds have largely normalized, the Company expects uneven demand trends across sales geographies coupled with continued strategic investments throughout the organization for future growth. As a result of these factors, the Company is providing fiscal 2024 guidance as follows: Total Revenue of $115 million and $128 millionTotal Adjusted Operating Income of $2.8 million and $3.8 millionTotal Adjusted Net Income of $1.2 million to $2.0 millionGuidance for adjusted operating income and adjusted net income is presented on an adjusted basis and excludes non-recurring items. All guidance is current as of the time provided and is subject to change.

(Nasdaq: FGI) is a leading global supplier of kitchen and bath products. For over 30 years, we have built an industry-wide reputation for product innovation, quality, and excellent customer service. We are currently focused on the following product categories: sanitaryware (primarily toilets, sinks, pedestals and toilet seats), bath furniture (vanities, mirrors and cabinets), shower systems, customer kitchen cabinetry and other accessory items. These products are sold primarily for repair and remodel activity and, to a lesser extent, new home or commercial construction. We sell our products through numerous partners, including mass retail centers, wholesale and commercial distributors, online retailers and specialty stores. Non-GAAP Measures In addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following non-GAAP measures to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business and assist us in making strategic decisions. Our non-GAAP measures are: Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margins and Adjusted Net Income. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP""). They are supplemental financial measures of our performance only, and should not be considered substitutes for net income, income from operations or any other measure derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other entities. We define Adjusted Operating Income as GAAP income from operations excluding the impact of certain non-recurring expenses, including expenses related to non-recurring compensation expenses related to our IPO, IPO legal fees, certain business expansion costs, and one-time anti-dumping penalty expenses. We define Adjusted Net Income as GAAP net income excluding the tax-effected impact of certain non-recurring expenses and income such as expenses related to COVID‑19 protocols, unusual litigation fees and non-recurring compensation expenses related to our IPO. We define Adjusted Operating Margins as adjusted income from operations divided by revenue. We use these non-GAAP measures, along with U.S. GAAP measures, to evaluate our business, measure our financial performance and profitability and our ability to manage expenses, after adjusting for certain non-recurring expenses, identify trends affecting our business and assist us in making strategic decisions. We believe these non-GAAP measures, when reviewed in conjunction with U.S. GAAP financial measures, and not in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results of operations under U.S. GAAP, are useful to investors as they are widely used measures of performance and the adjustments we make to these non-GAAP measures provide investors further insight into our profitability and additional perspectives in comparing our performance over time on a consistent basis. With respect to the Company's expectations of its future performance, the Company's reconciliations of guidance for full year 2024 Adjusted Operating Income and 2024 Adjusted Net Income are not available, as the Company is unable to quantify certain amounts to the degree of precision that would be required in the relevant GAAP measures without unreasonable effort.

Danimer Scientific Announces $15 Million Registered Direct Offering,2024-03-21T01:15:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Danimer Scientific (DNMR) announces a registered direct offering of 15,000,000 shares of common stock at $1.00 per share with accompanying warrants. The offering aims to raise capital for the company's biodegradable materials development.","Danimer Scientific Announces $15 Million Registered Direct Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Danimer Scientific (DNMR) announces a registered direct offering of 15,000,000 shares of common stock at $1.00 per share with accompanying warrants. The offering aims to raise capital for the company's biodegradable materials development. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The direct offering of 15,000,000 shares by Danimer Scientific at a price of $1.00 per share, alongside warrants exercisable at $1.33, represents a strategic move to raise capital. This influx of funds is likely earmarked for further research and development, scaling production, or other corporate purposes. From a financial perspective, the offering price per share can be indicative of current market conditions and investor sentiment towards the company.Investors should be aware that such capital raises can dilute existing shares, potentially leading to a decrease in share value in the short term. However, if the funds are utilized effectively for growth initiatives, there could be long-term benefits that offset initial dilution. The accompanying warrants could also incentivize investors by offering the potential for future stock purchases at a set price, which could be beneficial if the stock price appreciates over time. Market Research Analyst In the context of the bioplastics industry, Danimer Scientific's move to raise capital through a registered direct offering highlights the growing market for sustainable materials. The demand for biodegradable products is on the rise due to increased environmental awareness and regulatory pressures on plastic waste. Therefore, the company's ability to secure funding suggests confidence among investors in the potential growth of the bioplastics sector.However, it is critical to analyze the company's market position and the competitive landscape. The effectiveness of their technology, the scalability of their production processes and their ability to secure and maintain partnerships will be key factors in determining their long-term success and, by extension, the impact of this capital raise on their market share and financial health. Environmental Economist From an environmental economics standpoint, the significance of Danimer Scientific's capital raise extends beyond the company's financials and speaks to a broader shift towards sustainable business practices. The offering's success could signal a market trend where eco-friendly innovations are increasingly valued both economically and socially.It is important to consider the potential economic impact of bioplastics on traditional plastics industries and the implications for jobs, market dynamics and international trade. Moreover, the long-term environmental benefits, such as reduced reliance on fossil fuels and decreased plastic pollution, may translate into economic advantages for companies like Danimer Scientific that are early adopters of such technologies. 03/20/2024 - 09:15 PM BAINBRIDGE, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Danimer Scientific, Inc. (NYSE: DNMR) (the “Company” or “Danimer Scientific”), a leading next generation bioplastics company focused on the development and production of biodegradable materials, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement for the purchase and sale of 15,000,000 shares of common stock (or common stock equivalent in lieu thereof) at a purchase price of $1.00 per share (or per common stock equivalent in lieu thereof) and accompanying warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 15,000,000 shares of common stock in a registered direct offering. The warrants have an exercise price of $1.33 per share, will be exercisable commencing six months from the date of issuance and will expire five and one-half years following the date of issuance. The closing of the offering is expected to occur on or about March 25, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Roth Capital Partners is acting as the exclusive placement agent for the offering. The gross proceeds to the Company from the offering are expected to be approximately $15 million before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. The common stock (or common stock equivalent in lieu thereof) and warrants described above are being offered by the Company pursuant to a “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-267074) that was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on September 7, 2022.

The company's Founder and CEO, Michel Brousset, highlighted the strong performance of Milk Makeup with significant revenue growth, while Obagi Skincare faced challenges due to restructuring and delays in Southeast Asia. Positive H1’23 Total Net Revenue of $109.3 million Combined Adjusted EBITDA of $13.9 million, up from $7.6 million in H1’22 Strong growth in Combined Milk Net Revenue of +35.7% Milk Makeup's Adjusted EBITDA of $12.7 million, compared to $8.1 million in H1’22 Challenges in Obagi Skincare due to restructuring and delays in Southeast Asia Negative None. Financial Analyst Waldencast plc's financial results for H1 2023 reveal a significant improvement in their Combined Adjusted EBITDA, which has nearly doubled from $7.6 million in H1’22 to $13.9 million. This indicates a robust operational performance and efficient cost management. The Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric for investors as it provides insight into a company's profitability by excluding non-cash expenses and other one-time items. The growth in EBITDA, coupled with a strong revenue performance from Milk Makeup, suggests that Waldencast is effectively leveraging its brand portfolio to drive growth.However, the mixed performance in the Obagi Skincare segment, particularly the challenges in Southeast Asia, may raise concerns about international expansion risks and market penetration strategies. Investors should monitor how Waldencast navigates regulatory hurdles and adapts to market dynamics, which are critical for sustained growth in the beauty and wellness sector. Market Research Analyst The beauty and wellness industry is highly competitive and Waldencast's approach to accelerate Milk Makeup's performance while restructuring Obagi Skincare's business model demonstrates strategic agility. The substantial revenue growth of Milk Makeup by +35.7% is impressive, reflecting strong brand resonance and effective marketing strategies. This growth trajectory is a positive sign for stakeholders as it indicates the potential for market share expansion.The mention of lower Net Revenue from certain channels and delayed product registrations in Southeast Asia for Obagi Skincare, however, points to executional challenges. It's important for stakeholders to assess whether these are temporary setbacks or indicative of deeper issues that could affect long-term growth prospects. The beauty and wellness sector is sensitive to brand perception and operational efficiency, making it important for Waldencast to address these challenges promptly to maintain consumer and investor confidence. Economist Waldencast's introduction of guidance is a strategic move that could enhance investor confidence by providing a clearer picture of the company's financial trajectory. This transparency may lead to more stable stock prices as it reduces uncertainty. The company's performance, particularly the strong results from Milk Makeup, suggests resilience in the discretionary spending segment despite any potential macroeconomic headwinds.Furthermore, the issues faced in Southeast Asia highlight the economic complexities of operating in diverse markets with different regulatory landscapes. An economist's perspective would consider how Waldencast's international strategy aligns with broader economic trends, such as currency fluctuations, trade policies and consumer behavior shifts. The ability to adapt to these factors will be critical for Waldencast's long-term success in the global market. 03/20/2024 - 10:00 PM — H1’23 Total Net Revenue of $109.3 million— H1’23 Combined Adjusted EBITDA of $13.9 million up from $7.6 million in H1’22— Introduces guidance WHITE PLAINS, N.Y., March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Waldencast plc (NASDAQ: WALD) (“Waldencast” or the “Company”), a global multi-brand beauty and wellness platform, today announced that it furnished its results for the interim period ended June 30, 2023 (“H1 2023 Interim Financials”) on Form 6-K to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which are also available on the Company's investor relations site at http://ir.waldencast.com/. Michel Brousset, Waldencast Founder and CEO, said: “2023 was a year of transition during which we accelerated Milk Makeup’s performance, while making transformative changes to the Obagi Skincare business. Over the first half of 2023, on a comparable basis, Milk Makeup delivered strong Combined Milk Net Revenue growth of +35.7% and Milk Adjusted EBITDA of $12.7 million, compared with $8.1 million in the first half of 2022, a trend we saw continue into the second half of 2023. Obagi Skincare’s performance was mixed with Net Revenue growth in the core U.S. physician dispensed business overshadowed by lower Net Revenue from the planned restructuring of certain channels in the U.S. and from operations in Southeast Asia due to the previously announced delays in obtaining product registrations. Shipments in Southeast Asia resumed in the second half of 2023, however, the ramp in revenue was slower than originally anticipated. That said, we are very excited about the growth prospects for the region as we establish a new and more robust go-to market structure for Obagi Skincare's business in Southeast Asia that will ramp up over the next 18 months.” “For the full fiscal year 2023, we expect to deliver Combined Comparable Group Net Revenue growth in the mid-teens, and to yield significant advancement in profitability with Adjusted EBITDA Margin in the 10-12% range. While our fiscal 2023 results are expected to trail our original expectations, we believe that the changes made during 2023 will position us well to continue to achieve the on-going structural economics of our business model in 2024 with continued improvements of our Combined Comparable Group Net Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA Margin relative to 2023 guidance levels. This conviction is strengthened by the performance we have seen in the first couple of months of 2024 driven by strong innovation across both brands, particularly the launches of Milk Makeup Cooling Water Jelly Tints and Obagi Skincare's Hydro-Drops®Eye Gel.” First Half Fiscal 2023 Highlights On July 27, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), Waldencast consummated the business combination (“Business Combination”) with Obagi Global Holdings Limited (“Obagi Skincare”) and Milk Makeup LLC (“Milk Makeup”). The results below set out certain key performance highlights for the business for the periods presented in the H1 2023 Interim Financials. When reading the H1 2023 Interim Financials and this release, you should note there is a clear division between the “predecessor” periods that include consolidated financial statements up to the Closing Date and “successor” periods that include all periods after the acquisition date. The predecessor and successor results shown on a U.S. GAAP basis are not comparable, as the successor period includes the consolidated financial statements of Waldencast, Obagi Skincare and Milk Makeup, whereas the predecessor period includes only Obagi Skincare’s financial statements. We have included U.S. GAAP numbers for the period H2 2022 but note that they are presented primarily to inform the components of the non-GAAP metrics and do not allow for comparability for the periods presented for the reasons stated above. Please refer to our 2022 20-F filed with the SEC on January 16, 2024 for further information on our key accounting policies and restatements related to 2021 and 2020. Please also refer to the definitions and reconciliations set out further in this release with respect to certain adjusted non-GAAP measures discussed below which are included to provide an easier understanding of the underlying performance of the business given the above. Waldencast Group Net Revenue: U.S. GAAP Net Revenue was $109.3 million in the first half of 2023, and $68.3 million in the first half of 2022. Combined Comparable Group Net Revenue: Removing the China Business and including Milk Makeup in the comparable period for the first half of 2022, Combined Comparable Group Net Revenue was $106.0 million in the first half of 2023, up 5.1% from $100.8 million in the first half of 2022. Group Net Income/Loss and Adjusted EBITDA: Net loss was $(36.8) million during the first half of 2023, and $(17.6) million during the first half of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $13.9 million in the first half of 2023, and $(0.5) million during the first half of 2022. Group Combined Adjusted EBITDA: Combined Adjusted EBITDA was $13.9 million (12.7% Adjusted EBITDA Margin) during the first half of 2023, compared with $7.6 million during the first half of 2022. Obagi Skincare: For Obagi Skincare, U.S. GAAP Net Revenue was $57.0 million in the first half of 2023, compared with $68.3 million in the first half of 2022. Comparable Obagi Net Revenue was $53.7 million in the first half of 2023, down 13.8% vs. $62.2 million in the first half of 2022. The reduction in revenue was related primarily to the loss in revenue related to the Southeast Asia distributor (-$9.3m) and lower revenue recognized in connection with Obagi Skincare’s Amazon distributor (-$2.2m) resulting from the decision to pivot to a direct distribution model and the termination of the agreement in place with the Amazon distributor. Offsetting these impacts, Obagi.com grew 80.9%, from $2.9 million in the first half of 2022 to $5.3 million in the first half of 2023 and International distributors (excluding Southeast Asia) grew 20.7% to $8.4 million in the same period. Obagi Skincare recorded a Net Loss of $(12.2) million in H1 2023. Obagi Skincare Adjusted EBITDA was $9.6 million (16.9% Adjusted EBITDA Margin) in the first half of 2023, compared with $(0.5) million (-0.7% Adjusted EBITDA Margin) in the first half of 2022 which was achieved in part due to the fact that revenue in the first half of 2023 from the Southeast Asia distributor had better margins as a result of the cash basis revenue recognition accounting compared to the first half of 2022 where margins were adversely impacted by shipments being greater than cash collected. Milk Makeup: For Milk Makeup U.S. GAAP Net Revenue was $52.3 million in the first half of 2023. Combined Milk Net Revenue was $38.5 million for the first half of 2022, resulting in a 35.7% growth across periods on a comparable basis. Milk Makeup recorded a Net Loss of $(0.7) million in H1 2023. Milk Adjusted EBITDA of $12.7 million (24.3% Adjusted EBITDA Margin), compared with $8.1 million in the first half of 2022 driven by continued strong sales growth globally and improving gross margin. Liquidity: At June 30, 2023, Waldencast had $18.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and net debt of $196.5 million. Total cash flow in the period January 1, 2023 to June 30, 2023 was $10.2 million, including a $35 million draw down on the revolving credit facilities. The revolving credit facility was fully repaid using the proceeds from the private placement conducted by Waldencast in September 2023 and remained undrawn until the end of fiscal 2023. Outstanding shares: As of June 30, 2023, the Company had 108,016,112 ordinary shares outstanding, consisting of 87,032,559 Class A ordinary shares outstanding and 20,983,553 Class B ordinary shares outstanding. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 122,076,410 ordinary shares outstanding, consisting of 101,228,857 Class A ordinary shares outstanding and 20,847,553 Class B ordinary shares outstanding. Fully Diluted Shares increased to 129,695,296 million as of December 31, 2023, primarily driven by 14,000,000 million additional Class A ordinary shares issued in connection with the September 2023 private placement and 2,760,000 million ordinary shares granted as equity awards to employees. As of December 31, 2023, 70,245,039 Class A ordinary shares remain subject to contractual lock-up arrangements entered into in connection with the September 2023 private placement, of which (i) 10,401,884 were locked until March 14, 2024, (ii) 7,159,376 are locked until May 8, 2024, (iii) 31,205,649 are locked until September 14, 2024 and (iv) 21,478,130 are locked until November 8, 2024. Contractual lock-ups previously applying to former members of Milk Makeup and founders expired during the course of 2023. Further details regarding the duration of these lock-ups are set forth in our 2022 20-F. The publication of the H1 2023 Interim Financials marks an important milestone for Waldencast in regaining compliance with Nasdaq reporting requirements and satisfaction of the conditions granted by the hearing panel. Waldencast looks forward to providing further updates on FY 2023 performance in connection with the publication of its 2023 20-F. In connection with the restatement of prior financial statements described in further detail below, Waldencast also published restated financials for Obagi Skincare for the period ended March 31, 2022 as required under securities regulations. Obagi Skincare Obagi Skincare is a flagship well established brand in the physician dispensed market, one of the most attractive sub-segments of premium skin care in the U.S. With its breakthrough technology and transformative clinically proven results, Obagi Skincare unlocks high loyalty from both consumers and physicians, and we believe is well positioned to answer the growing consumer need for high performance effective skin care, while also paving the way for Obagi Skincare to expand into other categories. In the first half of 2023, Obagi Skincare reset its strategy and plans in the key strategic region of Southeast Asia through the acquisition of the Vietnam operations of the legacy Southeast Asia distributor and setting up the infrastructure to support a direct distribution model in the region, which is approximately 10 times the size of the Vietnam market. The skincare market in Southeast Asia is approximately $11 billion1 and growing rapidly and the Obagi Skincare brand has achieved widespread support from the dermatological community in the region. As part of this initiative, Obagi Skincare accelerated its organizational transformation in Southeast Asia with the appointment of a new management team. In connection with the restructuring of Obagi Skincare’s business in Southeast Asia, in 2023 management also decided to discontinue the Obagi Clinical range and focus on selling the flagship Obagi Medical range in the region. Beyond Southeast Asia, a number of initiatives were also implemented during the course of 2023 designed to reposition the business for future success, led by a new management team which was announced in H2 2023. In the first half of 2023 Obagi Skincare achieved U.S. GAAP Net Revenue of $57.0 million, compared with $68.3 million in the first half of 2022. Excluding sales from the China Business, Obagi Skincare delivered Comparable Obagi Net Revenue of $53.7 million in the first half of 2023, down 13.8% vs. $62.2 million in the first half of 2022. The reduction in revenue was related in part to the loss in revenue related to the Southeast Asia distributor (-$9.3m) and in part to lower revenue recognized in connection with Obagi Skincare’s Amazon distributor (-$2.2m) resulting from the decision to pivot to a direct distribution model and the termination of the agreement in place with the Amazon distributor. Offsetting these impacts, Obagi.com grew 80.9%, from $2.9m million in the first half of 2022 to $5.3 million in the first half of 2023 and International distributors (excluding Southeast Asia) grew 20.7% to $8.4 million in the same period. Obagi Skincare recorded a U.S. GAAP Net Loss of $(12.2) million in the first half of 2023. Obagi Adjusted EBITDA was $9.6 million (16.9% Obagi Adjusted EBITDA Margin) in the first half of 2023, compared with $(0.5) million (-0.7% Obagi Adjusted EBITDA Margin) in the first half of 2022 which was achieved in part due to the fact that revenue in the first half of 2023 from the Southeast Asia distributor had better margins as a result of the cash basis revenue recognition accounting compared to the first half of 2022 where margins were adversely impacted by shipments being greater than cash collected. As previously reported, in the first half of 2023, the Company implemented a series of initiatives relating to the Obagi Skincare business model in order to be better positioned to capture the opportunities in one of the fastest growing sub-segments of the skincare premium market. Obagi Skincare remains focused on the U.S. physician channel business, with a large healthcare professional account base consisting of more than 5,300 active medical provider accounts as of March 2024, and management estimates there are approximately 18,800 licensed physicians comprising licensed dermatologists and licensed cosmetic surgeons, resulting in broad distribution of Obagi products. __________________________¹ Source: Sales value of skin care in Southeast Asia* (USD Million) in 2023, Euromonitor, KPMG Analysis.

Milk Makeup Milk Makeup is a leading, award winning, prestige, clean makeup brand with unique products, a strong following among Gen-Z consumers and a growing global presence. Milk Makeup has built an organic following through a diverse and inclusive community known for its cultural relevance and iconic products. In the first half of 2023, Milk Makeup was the number 2 clean brand at Sephora U.S., bringing a relevant promise of cool, clean, makeup that works. This translated into a strong financial performance with Milk delivering in the first half of 2023 U.S. GAAP Net Revenue of $52.3 million, a gross margin of 62.8% and Net Loss of $(0.7) million. Milk Adjusted EBITDA was $12.7 million (24.3%) in the first half of 2023, compared with $8.1 million in the first half of 2022 driven by continued strong sales growth globally and improving gross margin. In the first half of 2023, Milk Makeup advanced on its key strategic goals via: Successfully bringing market leading innovation with two high profile launches Pore Eclipse Powder and Contouring Sticks (successful extension to existing strong Pillars Pore Eclipse and Sticks);Delivering high impact awareness by driving marketing campaigns both digitally on social media (e.g. TikTok) and through physical campaigns reaching their community in relevant touchpoints with relevant messaging; andExpanding into high demand markets such as the U.K. with the launch into Space NK and being a brand anchor of the highly publicized Sephora brick and mortar launch in the U.K. Financial Overview In accounting for the Business Combination, Waldencast was deemed to be the accounting acquirer, and Obagi Skincare was deemed to be the predecessor entity for purposes of financial reporting. Under the acquisition method of accounting, Waldencast’s assets and liabilities retained their carrying values and the assets and liabilities associated with Obagi Skincare and Milk Makeup were recorded at their fair values measured as of the acquisition date, which created a new basis of accounting. When reading the H1 2023 Interim Financials and this release, you should note there is a clear division between the “predecessor” periods that include consolidated financial statements up to the Closing Date and “successor” periods that include all periods after the acquisition date. The predecessor and successor results shown are not comparable, as the successor period includes the consolidated financial statements of Waldencast, Obagi Skincare, and Milk Makeup, whereas the predecessor period includes only Obagi Skincare’s financial statements. In addition, as previously disclosed, during the year ended December 31, 2023, management of the Company and the audit committee of Waldencast’s Board of Directors (the “Audit Committee”), with the assistance of legal and accounting advisors, conducted an internal review of certain accounting issues related to the recognition of revenue in Predecessor Periods, including issues related to the recognition of revenue from sales of Obagi Skincare products to Obagi’s Southeast Asia in Vietnam, transactions with other Obagi Skincare distributors both within and outside the U.S., as well as certain other accounting items. As a result of the review, the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee, concluded that financial statements for certain Predecessor Periods should no longer be relied upon and should be restated. See “Item 5. Waldencast’s Operating and Financial Review and Prospects” and ""Item 8. Financial Information- Note 2. Restatement and Reclassifications.” in the Company’s 2022 20-F filed with the SEC on January 16, 2024 for more information on the basis and impact of the restatement. Supplemental to the reported financial results set out in this section, management has also included certain key financial highlights for the business for the period covered in the H1 2023 Interim Financials which include non-GAAP measures which management uses to describe the underlying performance of the business. Please refer to definitions of the non-GAAP measures below and reconciliation to the closest GAAP measure.

Waldencast believes the non-GAAP measures used in this release provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. Waldencast believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends given the Business Combination and certain other factors. These non-GAAP measures also provide perspective on how Waldencast’s management evaluates and monitors the performance of the business. There are limitations to non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in GAAP financial presentation. The items excluded from GAAP financial measures such as net income/loss to arrive at non-GAAP financial measures are significant components for understanding and assessing our financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered together with, and not alternatives to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to definitions set out in the release and the tables included in this release for a reconciliation of these metrics to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as GAAP net income (loss) before interest income or expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization, and further adjusted for the items as described in the reconciliation below. We believe this information will be useful for investors to facilitate comparisons of our operating performance and better identify trends in our business. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain expenses that are required to be presented in accordance with GAAP because management believes they are non-core to our regular business. These include: (1) non-cash expenses, such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, inventory fair value adjustments, the amortization of fair value of the related party liability to Obagi China, change in fair value of financial instruments, loss on impairment of leases, and foreign currency transaction loss (gain); and (2) interest expense, income tax expense. In addition adjustments include expenses that are not related to our underlying business performance including (1) transaction-related costs which includes mainly legal expenses in connection with the Business Combination, including creating and maintaining the Up-C structure, as well as advisory and professional fees relating to the restatement and investigation; (2) non-operating gain due to a recovery of inventory and (3) other non-recurring loss. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of U.S. GAAP Net Revenue.

Negative None. 03/20/2024 - 07:09 PM Calgary, Alberta--(Newsfile Corp. - March 20, 2024) - Copper Fox Metals Inc. (TSXV: CUU) (OTCQX: CPFXF) (""Copper Fox"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that its unaudited interim consolidated January 31, 2024, financial statements have been filed on SEDAR+. For the three months ended January 31, 2024, Copper Fox had a net loss of $230,877 (January 31, 2023 - $279,590) which equated to $0.00 loss per share (January 31, 2023 - $0.00 loss per share). During the three months ended January 31, 2024, the Company incurred $503,344 in exploration expenditures primarily furthering the development of the Van Dyke (Miami, AZ), Mineral Mountain (Mineral Mountain Mining District, AZ), Sombrero Butte (Bunker Hill Mining District, AZ and Eaglehead (Liard Mining District, BC) copper projects. Copies of the financial statements, notes, and related management discussion and analysis may be obtained on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca, the Company's web site at www.copperfoxmetals.com or by contacting the Company directly. All references to planned activities and technical information contained in this news release have been previously announced by way of news releases. All amounts are expressed in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated.Elmer B. Stewart, President and CEO of Copper Fox, stated, ""During the Quarter, activities consisted of further derisking of the Van Dyke project by Copper Fox and the Schaft Creek project by the Schaft Creek Joint Venture (""SCJV""). The SCJV completed the most comprehensive field program completed to date and subsequent to the Quarter-end announced a C$18.7 million program and budget for 2024 to complete the studies required to transition the project from the Scoping to the Prefeasibility Study (""PFS"") stage by the end of 2024 or early 2025. Completion of the drillhole rehabilitation program at Van Dyke allows the Company to initiate the collection of hydrogeological and water quality data; key data that is required to advance the project to the permitting stage.Exploration activities on our 100% owned Eaglehead, Mineral Mountain and Sombrero Butte projects all yielded positive results. The Company extended the term of the exploration permit by two years on the Eaglehead project by filing a Notification of Deemed Authorization in February with the BC Ministry of Mines. An exploration plan to conduct a ""maiden"" drilling program at Mineral Mountain has been submitted to the Arizona Bureau of Land Management (""BLM"") and is currently under review. The open-ended, strong chargeability body at depths ranging from 300 and 500 meters ('m') below surface underlying the copper footprint at Mineral Mountain represents a compelling target, like the buried giant Resolution porphyry copper deposit located twenty-five miles northeast of the project. The hyperspectral survey at Sombrero Butte identified a significant number of previously unknown magmatic breccia bodies suggesting the possibility of multiple porphyry centers.""2024 Q1 HighlightsAt Schaft Creek (Liard Mining District, BC), the Schaft Creek Joint Venture (""SCJV"") received the results from the geotechnical drilling portion of the C$17.2 million 2023 program. The drilling intersected significant intervals of porphyry mineralization in five of the geotechnical drillholes including DDH SCK-23-468, located in the Paramount zone, which intersected higher grade mineralization:a 166.40 m core interval (295.10 to 461.50 m) that averaged 0.308% copper, 0.019% molybdenum, 0.117g/t gold and 0.82g/t silver that contained a 33.68 m interval (427.82 to 461.50 m) that averaged 0.602% copper, 0.033% molybdenum, 0.228g/t gold and 1.28 g/t silver, anda 206.14 m core interval (481.80 to 687.94 m) that averaged 0.494% copper, 0.029% molybdenum, 0.282g/t gold and 1.79g/t silver that contained a 90.70 m core interval (481.80 to 572.50 m) that averaged 0.710 % copper, 0.042% molybdenum, 0.305 g/t gold and 2.09 g/t silver. At Van Dyke, the mineral solubility/mineralogical testwork indicated a high degree of oxidization, rapid leaching rates for the copper minerals and low acid consuming gangue and host rock mineralogy. This work investigated two key project parameters and indicated low potential to generate carbon dioxide gas and the precipitation of gypsum during leaching operations; two operational issues that significantly impact copper production. At Mineral Mountain, the 2023 geophysical program outlined a large, open-ended positive chargeability/ resistivity anomaly at depth ranging between 300-500 m underlying the porphyry ""footprint"" a setting similar to the buried Resolution porphyry copper deposit to the northeast and the Florence porphyry copper deposit to the southwest. Subsequent to the Quarter-endOn February 6, 2024, the Company announced that the hyperspectral survey on the Sombrero Butte project identified a significant number of previously unknown interpreted magmatic breccia pipes suggesting the potential of more than one porphyry center. Magmatic breccias are a key indicator of the presence of a buried porphyry copper system.On February 14, 2024, the Company announced completion of the drillhole rehabilitation program and upgrading of the VWP's and data recorders in three drillholes at the Van Dyke project.On February 29, 2024, the Company announced the 2024 Schaft Creek program. The objective of the program is to advance key project parameters to transition the project from Scoping to Prefeasibility Study (""PFS"") stage by the end of 2024 or early in 2025. Planned expenditures in 2024 are C$18.7 million to be fully funded by Teck.Technical Activities:Completion of the metallurgical testwork program currently underway4,500 m of drilling focused on key technical areas including the Highwall, Tailing Storage Facility (""TSF""), and Rock Storage Facility (""RSF"") Engineering Studies:Site wide geotechnical and facilities assessment of the TSF, RSF and proposed infrastructureUpdate access road alignmentUpdate construction timelineUpdates to the Resource, Geologic, Structural and Slope Stability ModelsContinue the monthly Environmental Baseline data collection program initiated in 2023 and strengthen collaboration and engagement with the Tahltan NationElmer B.

Capital costs for 2024 are expected to be between US$3.0 - US$4.0 million and will include surface works and equipment procurement intended for the first phase of mine development for the Gloria and Abundancia Veins. Avino already has the mining equipment necessary to commence operations at La Preciosa. The application for the Environmental Permit has been submitted by the Company to the relevant authorities. A further permit will be submitted shortly after receipt of the Environmental Permit, which is required to commence the construction of the portal, haulage ramp, and the mining of the Gloria and Abundancia veins. Avino anticipates receiving these permits sometime in 2024. Avino is fully committed to moving this project forward as it factors prominently in the Company's 5-year growth strategy. Recent photos from the La Preciosa property can be viewed on our website by clicking here.Consistent Production Results at Avino:Silver equivalent production was steady although 27% lower compared to Q4 2022 and 9% lower compared to full year 2022. Overall production was impacted by mining in lower grade areas. Although grades were lower in 2023, we did see positive increases as we moved into other blocks of the mine in the fourth quarter. 2023 planned production levels for 2024, both the Avino Mine and stockpiles from La Preciosa will be 700,000 - 750,000 tonnes for mill processing. Targeted full year production between 2.5M and 2.8M silver equivalent ounces.Pre-Feasibility Study - Oxide Tailings ProjectOn February 5, 2024, the Company announced the completion of the Pre-Feasibility Study (""PFS"") for its Oxide Tailings Project (""OTP"") at the Avino Mine Operations. The completion of the PFS is a key milestone in our growth trajectory.The study highlighted Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves, a first in Avino's long history, of 6.70 Million tonnes at a silver and gold grade of 55 g/t and 0.47 g/t respectively.The OTP is considered one of our 3 catalysts for growth as a future gold and silver production asset.2023 Drill Programs - Announced Exceptional Drill ResultsAvino completed its planned and budgeted drilling program for 2023 by drilling 7,545 metres in 13 drill holes. This included the best intercept in Avino's 55-year history and was announced on July 5, 2023. Our team of geologists are implementing recommendations made by our consulting structural geologists to further study the potential of the entire mineralization. Drilling news releases for the year can be found in these links: January 5, 2023, May 23, 2023, July 5, 2023, and September 14, 2023.Avino Exploration and Evaluation for 2024The Company's budgeted exploration and evaluation expenditures for 2024 will be focused on regional exploration and further understanding of the structural geology below the current Avino Mine production area, with no drilling planned. The Company's priority is to move La Preciosa forward to development and production.Dry-Stack Tailings FacilityThe facility has been fully operational for a year. The conveyor system is installed and is currently transporting the pressed dry residues to the disused Avino open pit area. A tab is now available on our website that provides further information on our tailings management system along with videos (in English and Spanish) that can be viewed. In addition, a selection of short videos of the facility in operation can be viewed on our Company website, under Videos and Media.Capital ExpendituresFourth quarter capital expenditures company-wide were $1.1 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $8.5 million, compared to just under $9.0 million for the full year 2022 and within the range as previously disclosed in the Avino 2023 Outlook press release which can be found here on the Company's website. This figure also includes exploration expenditures on the Avino Property.ESG InitiativesAvino continues to strengthen and cultivate relationships with our local communities and stakeholders as it is our goal to contribute in positive and meaningful ways. We view the communities near the core of our operations as being indelibly at the center of successful mining projects. With recent additions to our Community Relations team in Durango, our energy has been directed towards supporting education in the local schools. Our ambition is to educate a younger population in their backyard, to encourage them to see the benefits of mining, and allow them to dream of a future where they can have a real career close to home.Mexican nationals account for 100% of our mine work force. Currently, we have 448 direct jobs which includes the workers at the mine site and in our Durango offices. This translates to approximately 3 times the number of indirect jobs for services, consultants and suppliers in the surrounding communities and the Durango area. After working diligently towards obtaining an ESR designation in 2022, the team in Durango has received this designation for the second time in August 2023, and is currently working on repeating this distinction.Qualified PersonPeter Latta, P.Eng, MBA, VP Technical Services, Avino who is a qualified person within the context of National Instrument 43-101 has reviewed and approved the technical data in this news release.Non-IFRS MeasuresThe financial results in this news release include references to cash cost per silver equivalent payable ounce, all-in sustaining cash cost per silver equivalent payable ounce, EBITDA, and adjusted earnings, all of which are non-IFRS measures. These measures are used by the Company to manage and evaluate the operating performance of the Company's mining operations and are widely reported in the silver and gold mining industry as benchmarks for performance, but do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS.

Lexin aims for sustainable growth and value creation for shareholders in 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results released by LexinFintech Holdings Ltd. reflect a company navigating a challenging macroeconomic environment with a degree of success. A 21.9% year-over-year growth in total loan origination and a 24.5% increase in outstanding loan balance suggest that the company is expanding its market share and has managed to grow its core business despite economic headwinds. The declared dividend payout of $0.066 per ADS for the second half of 2023, amounting to roughly 20% of total net income, indicates a commitment to returning value to shareholders, which can be a positive signal for investor confidence.However, the decrease in active users using loan products suggests potential challenges in customer acquisition or retention. This could be an area of concern for investors, as it may impact future revenue growth. It's also worth noting the record low funding cost, which has likely contributed to the improved net profit margins. The 56.2% increase in net profit, excluding investment-related impairment losses, is particularly noteworthy as it suggests operational efficiency and effective cost management. Risk Management Analyst The appointment of a new Chief Risk Officer with experience from Ant Group hints at Lexin's emphasis on strengthening risk management—a critical aspect for financial service providers. The reported 90-day+ delinquency ratio of 2.90% represents a slight increase from the previous quarter, which warrants monitoring as it might indicate a trend in credit quality. The first payment default rate below 1% is commendable and suggests effective initial screening of borrowers.The company's focus on targeting a higher-quality customer base and optimizing operations could be a strategic move to mitigate risk exposure. The balance between growth and risk performance that Lexin aims for in 2024 will be important for sustainable growth, especially in a slowly recovering macro environment. Market Research Analyst Lexin's performance in the tech-empowerment and installment e-commerce platform services provides insight into consumer behavior and market trends. While the tech-empowerment service saw a modest increase, the decline in income from the installment e-commerce platform service suggests a shift in consumer preferences or increased competition. The company's ability to maintain an 85% business customer retention rate in tech-empowerment services indicates a strong value proposition in that segment.Considering the broader financial technology sector, Lexin's growth in loan origination and revenue outpaces many peers, which could position the company favorably among investors. The emphasis on dual business growth engines driven by data and risk management aligns with industry trends towards digitalization and data-driven decision-making. 03/20/2024 - 06:00 PM SHENZHEN, China, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LexinFintech Holdings Ltd. (“Lexin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: LX), a leading technology-empowered personal financial service enabler in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. “Total loan origination for the fourth quarter reached RMB61.2 billion, with the full year figure for 2023 hitting RMB250 billion — aligning with the midpoint of the year's guidance and representing a 21.9% growth compared to the previous year. The outstanding loan balance climbed to RMB124 billion, marking a 24.5% year-over-year increase,” said Jay Wenjie Xiao, chairman and CEO of Lexin. “We experienced a fruitful 2023, showing the strong recovery and growth during a period of sluggish economic recovery and fluctuating credit markets.” “Over the past year, Lexin has significantly enhanced its operational capabilities across various business areas, thanks to a steadfast focus on core strategies that included strengthening risk management, targeting higher-quality customer base, optimizing operations, and implementing cost-effective initiatives. Our relentless efforts yielded satisfying results in 2023, laying a strong foundation for high-quality growth and further ecosystem strengthening in 2024,” added Mr. Xiao. He also extended a warm welcome to our new Chief Risk Officer Qiao Zhanwen and his onboarding as a new director of the Company, who formerly served as a Senior Director at Ant Group and Deputy General Manager at Chongqing Ant Consumer Finance. “Mr. Qiao’s extensive experience in risk management will greatly enhance our capabilities in this area moving forward.” “Looking into 2024, we will maintain our dual business growth engine driven by data and risk management, aiming for a healthy balance between growth and risk performance. Facing a slowly recovering macro environment, Lexin will continue to remain prudent and is committed to long-term sustainable value creation for shareholders and stakeholders. Continuing our capital return program, we have declared the dividend payout of US$0.066 per ADS for the six-month period ended December 31, 2023, roughly 20% of total net income. For the full year of 2023, we are paying out cash dividend of US$0.182 per ADS. In 2024, we expect to continue returning more value to shareholders by maintaining or increasing dividend when market conditions improve,” Mr. Xiao noted. “Lexin delivered another set of healthy quarterly results, achieving our full-year business goals and marking a year of tangible progress,” stated James Zheng, CFO of Lexin. “The fourth quarter’s total operating revenue reached RMB3.5 billion, with the full year revenue reaching RMB13.1 billion, a 32.3% increase year-over-year. Excluding after tax impact of RMB224 million of investment related impairment losses (1), the net profit for the fourth quarter was RMB236 million, contributing to a full-year net profit of RMB1.3 billion excluding the same impact, up 56.2% from the previous year. The past quarter saw a record low funding cost, operational refinements, improved early-repayment ratios, and a slight uptick in revenue take-rate of the loan facilitation business. In summary, 2023 was a year of rebound, with strong growth in both top and bottom lines surpassing many peers, driven by our core strategies.” _____________________________1).

Credit facilitation service income increased by 38.9% from RMB1,964 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 to RMB2,727 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Loan facilitation and servicing fees-credit oriented increased by 83.5% from RMB849 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 to RMB1,559 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increase in off-balance sheet loans originated under the credit-oriented model, as well as better control over the early repayment behaviors. Guarantee income increased by 42.0% from RMB500 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 to RMB709 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in loan originations and the increase of outstanding balances in the off-balance sheet loans funded by certain institutional funding partners, which are accounted for under ASC 460, Guarantees. Financing income decreased by 25.3% from RMB615 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 to RMB459 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the origination of on-balance sheet loans. Tech-empowerment service income increased by 3.4% from RMB413 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 to RMB427 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Funding cost decreased by 47.9% from RMB146 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 to RMB76.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was primarily driven by the decrease in the cost of capital and funding debts to fund the on-balance sheet loans.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Statement In evaluating our business, we consider and use adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company, non-GAAP EBIT, adjusted net income per ordinary share and per ADS attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company, four non-GAAP measures, as supplemental measures to review and assess our operating performance. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company as net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company excluding share-based compensation expenses, interest expense associated with convertible notes, and investment loss and we define non-GAAP EBIT as net income excluding income tax expense, share-based compensation expenses, interest expense, net, and investment loss. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and formulate business plans. Adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company enables our management to assess our operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, interest expense associated with convertible notes, and investment loss. Non-GAAP EBIT, on the other hand, enables our management to assess our operating results without considering the impact of income tax expense, share-based compensation expenses, interest expense, net, and investment loss. We also believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures facilitates investors’ assessment of our operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool. One of the key limitations of using adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company and non-GAAP EBIT is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect our operations. Share-based compensation expenses, interest expense associated with convertible notes, income tax expense, interest expense, net, and investment loss have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company and non-GAAP EBIT. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP financial information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. We compensate for these limitations by reconciling each of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, which should be considered when evaluating our performance. We encourage you to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.

The collaboration includes platform, ecosystem, and marketing plans, with strategic partnerships with key players like Krafton and Digital Turbine. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The collaboration between ONE Store and HAPPYTUK represents a strategic move to tap into the Taiwanese market, which could have significant implications for both companies' market shares and revenue streams. The partnership leverages ONE Store's platform and HAPPYTUK's local market expertise, potentially creating a formidable presence against established global competitors. The focus on integrating multiple payment options is indicative of a tailored approach to meet regional consumer preferences, which is a critical factor in gaining market acceptance.Furthermore, the recent investments from major entities like Krafton, Digital Turbine and Microsoft suggest a strong vote of confidence in ONE Store's growth trajectory and its potential to disrupt the current app market dynamics. The mention of the Digital Markets Act hints at regulatory tailwinds that may favor alternative app markets, presenting a timely strategic advantage for ONE Store's expansion efforts. Financial Analyst ONE Store's aggressive fundraising and strategic partnerships are key indicators of its expansionary strategy and could have an impact on investor sentiment. The USD 50 million investment from Digital Turbine, in particular, is a substantial capital infusion that could support the development of ONE Store's platform and ecosystem. This move may also suggest future revenue-sharing or cross-promotion opportunities that could enhance profitability for both parties.Investors should monitor the execution of ONE Store's global expansion plans, as successful entry into new markets like Taiwan could lead to increased earnings and market valuation. However, the costs associated with these expansion efforts, including marketing and operational expenditures, will likely affect short-term profitability. The long-term benefits, assuming successful market penetration, could offset these initial costs. Gaming Industry Specialist The gaming industry is characterized by intense competition and high user acquisition costs. By partnering with HAPPYTUK, ONE Store gains access to a large user base and an extensive catalog of game titles, which could provide a competitive edge. The emphasis on sourcing game content locally is a strategic move that aligns with the increasing demand for culturally relevant and localized gaming experiences.Additionally, the partnership's potential impact on indie developers and smaller game studios should be considered, as it could offer them an alternative platform to showcase their games, diversifying their distribution channels beyond the dominant players. This could foster innovation and competition within the gaming industry, benefiting both creators and consumers. 03/20/2024 - 08:30 PM ONE Store and HAPPYTUK Collaborate on Platform, Ecosystem, Operations, and Marketing Plans to Launch Local App Market in Taiwan by Year-End, Accelerating Global Market Entry ONE Store Partners with Key Players like Krafton and Digital Turbine for Global ExpansionTAIPEI and SEOUL, South Korea, March 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ONE Store, Korea's second largest app market outperforming global competitors, announced that it has signed a platform and service agreement with HAPPYTUK, Taiwan's largest game publishing company, to provide an app market service targeting the Taiwanese market. As a leading game publisher in Taiwan, HAPPYTUK operates subsidiaries across Mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, Korea, Japan, Thailand, and beyond. Since its establishment in 2012, HAPPYTUK has expanded its business beyond publishing to include game operation, marketing, and development, demonstrating comprehensive capabilities across the gaming industry. It owns mangtot5, a game-specialized portal with over 4 million members, boasting the largest membership base in Taiwan. Additionally, it offers the most extensive number of game titles among publishers in Taiwan. ONE Store will provide its platform and developer ecosystem, while HAPPYTUK will manage platform operation and marketing. Both companies will collaboratively handle the sourcing of game content in Taiwan. ONE Store plans to open an alternative app market in Taiwan by the end of this year, based on this agreement. Once the ONE Store and HAPPYTUK app market launches, developers can immediately offer services in both the Korean and Taiwanese markets by onboarding ONE Store. Both companies aim to assist developers with diverse promotional activities and ensure seamless service provision by integrating multiple payment options within Taiwan. ONE Store, which is extending its reach into the global market beyond its position as a leading domestic app market, is accelerating this process by securing strategic partners one after another. Last month, ONE Store signed a cooperation agreement with Digital Turbine (Nasdaq: APPS), a global mobile platform company, securing a total investment of USD 50 million. Prior to this, in October of last year, ONE Store brought in KRW 20 billion from Krafton, and in 2021 USD 15 million from Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) and Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners (DTCP). These strategic partnerships are paving the way for ONE Store's ambitious global expansion. ONE Store plans to secure blockbuster games and accelerate its global expansion based on successful fundraising. Additionally, ONE Store has stepped up the expansion of overseas business based on global tailwinds from the movement to ensure fairer competition such as mandatory introduction of independent app markets (Digital Markets Act) which is underway in global markets including Europe and US. ""We are pleased to embark on a full-scale entry into the Asian market with HAPPYTUK, Taiwan's top publisher. With this agreement, ONE Store aims to make this year the starting point of expanding our overseas business and evolving into one of the most influential global app markets"" said Peter Chun, CEO of ONE Store. ""We are delighted to provide customers with ONE Store, a leading app store in Korea. We look forward to a variety of games which we will provide going forward"" said Ryan Yang, CEO of HAPPYTUK. About ONE Store ONE Store is Korea's leading app market, offering a diverse range of digital content including games, apps, and multimedia content. Building on over 10 years of successful app market experience and technology, ONE Store is now venturing into the global market. The major shareholders of ONE Store include SK Square, Naver, Microsoft, Krafton, KT, and LGU+.

Negative None. Market Research Analyst The disclosed financial results and operational updates from Lithium Argentina are significant indicators of the company's current performance and future prospects within the lithium market, a sector that is pivotal for the burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) industry. The company's successful commencement of production at Caucharí-Olaroz, reaching 50% of its 40,000 tonnes per annum capacity, is a noteworthy milestone. The target to reach nameplate capacity by the end of the year reflects an aggressive ramp-up strategy, which could enhance its competitiveness and market share.Furthermore, the strategic investment by Ganfeng Lithium Co. Ltd. in the Pastos Grandes project and the regional development plan indicate a strengthening of ties with a key industry player, potentially providing Lithium Argentina with additional expertise and financial support. This collaboration could lead to synergies and solidify the company's standing in the global supply chain for lithium, a critical component for EV batteries.From a financial perspective, the company's strong balance sheet, with $122M in cash and cash equivalents and prudent management of convertible debt and credit facilities, positions it well to navigate market volatility. The proactive measures to reduce spending by 25% in response to market conditions show a commitment to maintaining financial health and shareholder value. Financial Analyst The financial highlights reveal a robust liquidity position for Lithium Argentina, with significant cash reserves and manageable debt levels. The convertible debt at 1.75% due in 2027 is favorable given the current interest rate environment, indicating a cost-effective capital structure. The absence of drawdowns on the available credit facility suggests a disciplined approach to leveraging.The net income reported for FY 2023 presents a dramatic turnaround from the previous year's loss, largely due to income from discontinued operations. This may reflect strategic divestitures or restructuring efforts, which could be a sign of a company focusing on its core competencies and streamlining operations for efficiency.Investors should note that Lithium Argentina's operational progress and financial results are set against the backdrop of a volatile lithium market, where prices can fluctuate with changes in supply and demand dynamics. The company's forward-looking statements regarding the generation of positive cash flow from operations in 2024 are contingent on maintaining current price levels and achieving production targets, which are not guaranteed. The planned refinancing of local debt suggests a proactive approach to capital management, aiming to improve the company's debt profile and reduce financial risk. Environmental and Resource Economist The lithium industry is at the intersection of resource economics and environmental sustainability. Lithium Argentina's operation in the Caucharí-Olaroz region represents a significant development in terms of resource extraction and its impact on the local economy. The investment into Northern Argentina, exceeding $1 billion, indicates the project's scale and potential economic impact on the region, including job creation and infrastructure development.The company's focus on producing high-purity lithium carbonate aligns with the growing demand for high-quality battery materials. The environmental implications of lithium mining, particularly in terms of water usage and ecosystem impact, are critical considerations. Lithium Argentina's progress towards full capacity and the development of a regional plan with Ganfeng could set a precedent for responsible resource development in the lithium sector.The long-term outlook for lithium demand is positive, driven by the global transition to electric vehicles and renewable energy storage solutions. However, the industry faces challenges, including the need for sustainable extraction methods and potential regulatory changes aimed at environmental protection. Companies like Lithium Argentina that can navigate these complexities while expanding production capacity are well-positioned to capitalize on the market's growth trajectory. 03/20/2024 - 08:01 PM VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lithium Americas (Argentina) Corp. (“Lithium Argentina,” the “Company,” or “LAAC”) (TSX: LAAC) (NYSE: LAAC), formerly Lithium Americas Corp. (“Lithium Americas” or “LAC”), today announced fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, as well as its 2024 outlook. Highlights On March 18, 2024, Sam Pigott commenced as President and CEO of the Company. John Kanellitsas will remain Executive Chairman of the Company.On March 19, 2024, Sam Pigott and Monica Moretto were appointed to the Board of Directors.On March 5, 2024, Ganfeng Lithium Co. Ltd. (“Ganfeng”) agreed to invest $70M for an expected 15% stake in the Pastos Grandes project through a subscription of newly-issued shares of the Company’s Argentine subsidiary, Proyecto Pastos Grandes S.A. (the “Pastos Grandes Transaction”). Ganfeng, with support of Lithium Argentina, will undertake preparation of a regional development plan for the Pastos Grandes basin and surrounding properties, expected to be finalized by the end of 2024.The transaction is expected to close in Q2 2024 with proceeds available to support the Company’s Argentine operations. Operational Highlights Production commenced in June 2023 at Caucharí-Olaroz, the largest new greenfield lithium brine project. In 2023, approximately 6,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate were produced, achieving 99.5% lithium carbonate content and technical-quality specifications. Caucharí-Olaroz is producing at approximately 50% of the 40,000 tonnes per annum (“tpa”) capacity. The operation is targeting to reach nameplate capacity on a limited basis by mid-2024 and maintain a level near capacity on a steady state basis by the end of the year. 2024 targeted production at Caucharí-Olaroz of 20,000 – 25,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate.In the current price environment, the project is expected to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2024.While planning for Stage 2 expansion in production capacity continues to advance, the Company has not committed material capital to growth capex at this time. Financial Highlights As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $122M in cash and cash equivalents. The Company has $259M in convertible debt at 1.75% due in early 2027 and has not drawn on its $75M credit facility with Ganfeng. As of December 31, 2023, Minera Exar S.A., the Argentine joint venture company owned by the Company (44.8%), Ganfeng (46.7%) and Jujuy Energia y Mineria Sociedad del Estado (8.5%) had approximately $234M (on a 100% basis, less cash collateral) of local debt tied to funding working capital and startup costs. The Company and Ganfeng are in the process of finalizing new credit facilities to refinance a substantial portion of this local debt with longer maturity credit facilities typical of an operating business. Cognizant of market conditions in the lithium market, the Company has commenced proactive measures to reduce discretionary exploration and evaluation and general and administrative spending at the corporate level by 25%. Commenting on the results for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023, John Kanellitsas, Executive Chairman, Lithium Argentina commented: “Last year was a milestone year for Lithium Argentina, with the commencement of operations at the Caucharí-Olaroz site in Argentina. This achievement was the culmination of years of hard work, dedication and determination, and an over $ 1 billion investment into Northern Argentina. I am proud of the cross-cultural team that came together to diligently progress Caucharí-Olaroz, making it the success it is today. Additionally, last year Lithium Argentina closed on the acquisition of our majority stake in the Sal de la Puna project and completed the spin-off of our North American assets. I am confident that the great work that has been done to date, will be the foundation for great achievements for the Company in the future”. Mr. Kanellitsas closed by saying, “I am honored to welcome Sam Pigott as President and CEO, his 20 plus-years of experience in mining, finance and business development will be invaluable to the Company and I look forward to working with him in my continued role as Executive Chairman”. Sam Pigott, CEO of Lithium Argentina, commented: “Following the accomplishments of Lithium Argentina, I am eager to work with this experienced team and Board to take the Company to the next level and maximize value for all shareholders. As I look to the coming year, the priority is completing the ramp up of Stage 1 of Caucharí-Olaroz and transitioning from development to operations. The project is well on its way to completing commissioning and is currently producing at approximately 50% capacity, making it already among the largest operations in Argentina. The operation is targeting to reach nameplate capacity on a limited basis by mid-2024 and maintain a level near capacity on steady state basis by the end of the year. The Company looks forward to advancing its role in providing such a critical input to the electric vehicle industry. While, the commissioning of the project has been going very well, we will remain cognizant of the market environment and will make thoughtful decisions to ensure that shareholder value is protected.” “The recent agreement to prepare a regional development plan together with Ganfeng for their Pozuelos Pastos Grandes project and Lithium Argentina’s Pastos Grandes and Sal de la Puna projects is a potentially lucrative opportunity to organize the development of these assets in a logical way while maintaining optionality for offtake. The Company’s strong balance sheet coupled with the high quality and low-cost nature of its brine assets in Argentina, will position it better to navigate the cyclical nature of the lithium market today and in the future.” INVESTOR WEBCAST AN INVESTOR WEBCAST HAS BEEN SCHEDULED FOR 10:00am ET ON THURSDAY, MARCH 21, 2024.

The dividend payable was then settled through the distribution of the net assets. In accordance with IFRS 5, Non-Current Assets Held for Sales and Discontinued Operations, the operations of Lithium Americas (NewCo) have been classified as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021. Expenses of continuing operations decreased from 2022 to 2023, primarily due to share of gain of the Caucharí-Olaroz project versus loss in the comparative period mainly as a result of foreign exchange revaluation of intercompany loans; offset by an increase in exploration and evaluation expenditures as result of the timing of the Pastos Grandes project development activities and general and administrative expenses due to an increase in salaries, professional fees and office and administration expenses. In 2023, total assets increased primarily due to the acquisition of Arena Minerals Inc., loans advanced to Exar Capital, offset by the distribution of assets to the shareholders upon the Separation. Total long-term liabilities decreased due to a decrease in the fair value of the Convertible Notes derivative liability, offset by accrued interest on the Convertible Notes, the recognition of a deferred income tax liability due to the weakening of the Argentine Pesos against the US dollar and the distribution of liabilities to the shareholders upon the Separation. This news release should be read in conjunction with Lithium Argentina’s audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 and management's discussion and analysis for year ended December 31, 2023, which are available on SEDAR+.

Financial Analyst The financial results of Epsilon Energy Ltd. for the full year ended December 31, 2023, reveal a mixed performance characterized by a significant decline in net revenue from natural gas sales and a considerable increase in oil production. The company's strategic pivot towards diversifying its portfolio, particularly its investments in the Permian basin, indicates an adaptive response to the volatile energy market. The reported decrease in net revenue interest (NRI) natural gas production and the corresponding drop in natural gas prices underscore the challenges faced by the sector, exacerbated by backward-looking SEC natural gas prices.However, the notable uptick in oil production and the proactive capital return to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends demonstrate management's commitment to shareholder value. The financial prudence of maintaining a strong balance sheet with no debt and a substantial cash reserve positions Epsilon favorably for future investments and weathering market fluctuations. The 2024 outlook, with a projected increase in liquids production volumes, could signal a strategic shift that may enhance the company's revenue streams if the Permian investments yield the expected results.From an investment standpoint, the company's aggressive share repurchase program reflects confidence in the intrinsic value of its stock, potentially signaling undervaluation to the market. This could be an attractive point for investors, especially considering the company's robust balance sheet and strategic positioning in both the Permian and Marcellus regions. Energy Market Analyst The significant decrease in average realized prices for natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids as reported by Epsilon Energy Ltd. is indicative of broader market trends, where energy companies have been grappling with fluctuating commodity prices. The company's reported decrease in natural gas production and the corresponding decline in revenues from natural gas sales reflect the impact of these market conditions. The decision to diversify with investments in the oil-rich Permian basin is a strategic move that aligns with current industry practices, where companies are seeking to balance their portfolios amidst market volatility.The emphasis on self-funding for future developments is a prudent approach that minimizes risk and capital exposure. The performance of the newly drilled wells, exceeding pre-drill estimates by over 25%, is a promising indicator of the company's operational efficiency and the potential of its asset base. The reserves report, showing a decrease in total proved and probable reserves, highlights the importance of strategic asset management and the need for continuous evaluation of reserve potential, especially in light of changing market prices and regulatory requirements.Overall, Epsilon's strategic objectives and operational results provide insights into the company's adaptability and resilience in a challenging energy market. The focus on liquids production and midstream cash-flows could offer a balanced revenue mix that may mitigate the risks associated with price volatility in the natural gas sector. Corporate Strategy Analyst Epsilon Energy's strategic focus on diversifying its business and maintaining a strong balance sheet through a challenging year is a testament to its resilience and forward-thinking approach. The acquisition of interests in the Permian basin represents a strategic diversification that not only spreads risk across different commodities and basins but also sets a foundation for a multi-year investment platform. The company's ability to pivot and adapt to changing market conditions by focusing on liquids production and midstream cash-flows is a strategic move that may offer a competitive edge.The company's commitment to shareholder returns, as evidenced by the share repurchase program and quarterly dividends, suggests a strong belief in the intrinsic value of the company and a dedication to delivering shareholder value. The robust balance sheet, characterized by ample liquidity and no debt, provides the flexibility to pursue attractive investments and underscores the company's financial discipline.Looking ahead, the impact of the company's strategic initiatives on its financial performance will be critical. The anticipated growth in liquids production volumes and the potential increase in upstream Adjusted EBITDA in 2024 will be key factors in assessing the success of the company's diversification strategy and its ability to deliver on its promise of compounding shareholder equity. 03/20/2024 - 07:02 PM HOUSTON, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Epsilon Energy Ltd.

Average realized price of $1.78 per Mcf for natural gas excluding hedges ($2.17 including hedges), a decrease of 70% compared to 2022Average realized price of $77.96 per Bbl for oil, a decrease of 21% compared to 2022Average realized price of $25.29 per Bbl for natural gas liquids, a decrease of 36% compared to 2022 Total revenues of $30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of 56% compared to 2022. $14.8 million from natural gas sales, a 74% decrease compared to 2022$5.1 million from oil sales, an 59% increase compared to 2022$1.0 million from natural gas liquids sales, a decrease of 43% compared to 2022$9.8 million from gathering and compression fees through our ownership in the Auburn Gas Gathering System, after eliminating revenue earned from Epsilon production ($1.4 million), including a $1.0 million one-time fee adjustment as a result of the operator’s internal audit; Adjusted EBITDA of $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Free cash flow (FCF) before changes in working capital of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments (U.S. Treasuries) were $32.6 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 29% compared to December 31, 2022. Returned $11.7 million to shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2023. $6.1 million through the repurchase of 1,158,849 shares, representing 5% of shares outstanding at December 31, 2022 at an average price of $5.20 per share$5.6 million through the quarterly dividendsAn additional 248,700 shares were repurchased in January 2024 at $4.82 per share Jason Stabell, Epsilon’s Chief Executive Officer, commented, “2023 was a challenging year for natural gas but we ended the year having accomplished our key strategic objectives to diversify our business, continue robust shareholder returns and maintain a rock-solid balance sheet. Here are some further details on these three objectives: 1) We acquired interests and made drill-bit investments in the Permian basin during 2023 and again in the first quarter of 2024, as we recently announced, adding a new core area at an attractive price. The deals diversify our commodity and basin mix and provide a multi-year investment platform of 20-30 gross 2-mile lateral locations. We expect the go-forward Permian development to be largely self-funding and contribute more than 50% of our projected upstream Adjusted EBITDA in 2024 at current forward prices. 2) We continued to return capital to our shareholders through opportunistic buybacks (repurchased over 5% of shares outstanding in 2023 and another 1+% in the first quarter of 2024) and quarterly dividends supported by our fee based midstream cash-flows. 3) We maintained ample liquidity for continued flexibility to make attractive investments and shareholder returns. We exited the year with over $30 million in cash and short term investments, no debt, and an undrawn revolver of $35 million. Note our cash position reduced by ~$15 million this quarter following our recent acquisition announced and closed on February 27th. In 2024, we expect a significant increase (YoY 2-3x) in our liquids production volumes driven by contribution from our recent acquisition and continued development in the Permian. We remain very encouraged by the results of the 2 gross wells (.5 net) put on production in Q423. The wells are performing more than 25% above our pre-drill estimates. In PA, we expect to see year-over-year declines in gas volumes as initial production on the 7 gross wells recently drilled and completed is delayed until later in the year and we experience normal declines on legacy production. The Company remains in a strong financial position with the ability to capitalize on attractive opportunities under a variety of market conditions. We believe our stock represents an attractive risk reward with a unique mix of Permian upstream liquids and Marcellus gas assets coupled with a long-lived fee based midstream business. As we go forward in 2024, our objective remains simple: compound our shareholder’s equity through attractive investments and consistent shareholder returns.” 2023 Operating Results Epsilon’s capital expenditures were $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, over a 2X increase from 2022. This capital was primarily related to leasehold acquisition and the drilling and completion of 2 gross (0.5 net) wells in Ector Co. Texas, the drilling and completion of 2 gross (0.2 net) wells in Eddy Co. New Mexico, and the drilling of 7 gross (0.7 net) wells in Susquehanna Co. Pennsylvania. At December 31, 2023, the Company has seven gross (0.7 net) Marcellus wells waiting on completion. The Texas wells came online in October 2023 and the New Mexico wells came online in May 2023. The Auburn Gas Gathering System (Epsilon is a 35% owner) gathered and delivered 66.2 Bcf gross natural gas volumes (23.2 Bcf net to Epsilon’s interest) during the year, or 181 MMcf/d. Fourth Quarter 2023 Results The Company’s net revenue interest (NRI) total production was 2.3 Bcfe (24.6 MMcfe/d) for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Natural gas NRI production was 2.0 Bcf (21.7 MMcfe/d) and oil and natural gas liquids NRI production was 44.7 MBbls (486 Bopd). Epsilon generated revenues of $8.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. $3.5 million from natural gas sales;$2.9 million from oil and natural gas liquids sales$2.2 million from gathering and compression fees through our ownership in the Auburn Gas Gathering System, after eliminating revenue earned from Epsilon production ($0.3 million); Adjusted EBITDA of $5.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Free cash flow (FCF) before changes in working capital of $4.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Reserves The Company has received the year-end 2023 third party reserves report completed by the consulting firm DeGolyer & MacNaughton. The table below summarizes the report. Epsilon Net Year End 2023 Reserves (MMcfe) 12/31/2022 12/31/2023 Change%Proved Developed 80,795 50,681 (30,114)-37%Proved Undeveloped 13,459 19,581 6,122 45%Total Proved 94,254 70,262 (23,992)-25%Probable Developed 24,943 25,375 431 2%Probable Undeveloped 264,011 136,099 (127,912)-48%Total Probable 288,954 161,474 (127,481)-44%Total Proved + Probable 383,210 231,736 (151,473)-40% As shown in the table above, Company Proved reserves decreased 25% year over year. Produced volumes accounted for 35% of the change. Lower SEC natural gas prices ($1.64 p/Mcf for PA in 2023, $5.32 p/Mcf for PA in 2022), which are backward looking, accounted for the rest of the declines, partially offset by additions from 2023 development activities. Pricing also drove the declines in Probable reserves. As the Company does not operate its assets in Pennsylvania, it can have limited visibility on future development plans and timing. We are required to have line of sight on development to qualify undeveloped reserves as Proved. We anticipate reclassifying reserves in PA back to Proved once we have more clarity on development timing. The acquired Texas properties were early life at year end 2023 and as a result the associated reserves were conservatively estimated. We anticipate adding additional oil-weighted reserves with more production history and incremental development in 2024. One-Year Share Repurchase Program The Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 2,191,320 common shares, representing 10% of the outstanding common shares of Epsilon, for an aggregate purchase price of not more than US $12.0 million, pursuant to a normal course issuer bid. The one-year period will commence on March 27, 2024. The program will end on March 26, 2025 unless the maximum amount of common shares is purchased before then or Epsilon provides earlier notice of termination. The Company believes that the market price of its common shares may not reflect their underlying value and the Board of Directors has authorized this initiative because, in the Board’s opinion, the proposed repurchase of common shares constitutes an appropriate use of Epsilon’s funds, and the repurchase of its common shares is one way of creating shareholder value. Repurchases will be made from time to time through the facilities of the NASDAQ Global Market. The price paid for the common shares will be, subject to applicable securities laws, the prevailing market price of such common shares on the NASDAQ Global Market at the time of such purchase. The Company intends to fund the purchase out of available cash and does not expect to incur debt to fund the share repurchase program. Earning’s Call The Company will host a conference call to discuss its financial and operational results on Thursday, March 21, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time).

Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements contained in this news release constitute forward looking statements. The use of any of the words “anticipate”, “continue”, “estimate”, “expect”, ‘may”, “will”, “project”, “should”, ‘believe”, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated. Forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but no assurance can be given that these expectations will prove to be correct and the forward-looking statements included in this news release should not be unduly relied upon. The reserves and associated future net revenue information set forth in this news release are estimates only. In general, estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and the future net revenue therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as production rates, ultimate reserves recovery, timing and amount of capital expenditures, ability to transport production, marketability of oil and natural gas, royalty rates, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and future operating costs, all of which may vary materially from actual results. For those reasons, estimates of the oil and natural gas reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, as well as the classification of such reserves and estimates of future net revenues associated with such reserves prepared by different engineers (or by the same engineers at different times) may vary. The actual reserves of the Company may be greater or less than those calculated. In addition, the Company's actual production, revenues, development and operating expenditures will vary from estimates thereof and such variations could be material. Statements relating to ""reserves"" are deemed to be forward-looking statements as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the reserves described exist in the quantities predicted or estimated and can be profitably produced in the future. There is no assurance that forecast price and cost assumptions will be attained and variances could be material. Proved reserves are those reserves which are most certain to be recovered. Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than Proved reserves but which, together with Proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. Undeveloped reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure (for example, when compared to the cost of drilling a well) is required to render them capable of production. They must fully meet the requirements of the reserves classification (Proved, Probable) to which they are assigned. The estimates of reserves and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same confidence level as estimates of reserves and future net revenue for all properties due to the effects of aggregation. The estimated future net revenues contained in this news release do not necessarily represent the fair market value of the Company's reserves.

received or paid on settlement 121,835 (1,461,914) Foreign currency translation loss (278) (850) Adjusted EBITDA $18,827,512 $52,885,202 Epsilon defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before (1) net interest expense, (2) taxes, (3) depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion expense, (4) impairments of natural gas and oil properties, (5) non-cash stock compensation expense, (6) gain or loss on derivative contracts net of cash received or paid on settlement, and (7) other income. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance as determined under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for net income or cash flow measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP or as a measure of profitability or liquidity. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Epsilon has included Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental disclosure because its management believes that EBITDA provides useful information regarding its ability to service debt and to fund capital expenditures. It further provides investors a helpful measure for comparing operating performance on a ""normalized"" or recurring basis with the performance of other companies, without giving effect to certain non-cash expenses and other items. This provides management, investors and analysts with comparative information for evaluating the Company in relation to other natural gas and oil companies providing corresponding non-U.S. GAAP financial measures or that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. These non-U.S. GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, measures for financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

FCF is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the SEC’s rules. Management believes, however, that FCF is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company’s financial performance, as it measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations. FCF should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, net income as a measure of our performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Additionally, our definition of FCF is limited and does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other obligations, payments made for business acquisitions, amounts spent to buy back shares, or pay dividends. Therefore, we believe it is important to view FCF as supplemental to our entire statement of cash flows. What was Epsilon Energy 's total production for the year ended December 31, 2023?

The Updated Technical Reports were prepared pursuant to NI 43-101 by a Qualified Person, Mr. Robert A. Lunceford. The Updated Technical Reports are available on the Company's SEDAR profile at www.sedarplus.ca and on the Company's website at www.iconicminerals.com.Smith Creek Lithium Property Extensive exposures of Tertiary siliceous ash flow tuff units, which are recognized source rocks for lithium, surround the Smith Creek Property both on the east and west. Lithium was eroded and deposited in the closed basin. On the west side of the Property, hot geothermal springs occur along major faults. Limited geochemical surficial sampling of sediments surrounding the hot springs conducted by Iconic 470 ppm Li, considered to be strongly anomalous. Two Magnetotelluric (MT) surveys have identified a low resistivity horizon averaging 650 ft. (200 m) in thickness. This lithium brine target MT anomaly occurs 650 ft. (200 m) to over 3,000 ft. (1 km) below the surface. The fault related lithium anomaly and the low MT resistivity indicate a possibly significant target.Grass Valley Lithium PropertyAt Grass Valley Tertiary siliceous volcanic units occur on the western side of the basin and provide a critical source for lithium-rich sediments or brines. The basin is flanked by hot geothermal springs which are believed to enhance the solubility of lithium and lower the pH of the brine to reduce the precipitation of lithium ions out of solution. To determine brine potential a single, north-south MT (Magneto Telluric) survey line was conducted. The survey indicated that a significant low resistivity zone possibly indicating brine occurred within the alluvial sequence. The depth to the low resistivity target ranges from 2,500 ft. (760 m) to more than 3,300 ft. (1,000 m) beneath the surface. Limited surface sampling confirmed that lithium in sediments assayed up to 310 ppm Li which is considered to be significantly anomalous.Qualified PersonRichard Kern, Certified Professional Geologist, a qualified person as defined by Canadian National Instrument 43-101, has reviewed and approved the technical information contained in this news release.

MediciNova’s Chief Medical Officer, Kazuko Matsuda, MD PhD MPH will present the ongoing clinical trial design and objectives, and Dr. Qi Huicheng will present the results of the research to evaluate the mechanism of action of MN-001 (tipelukast) and MN-002 (a major metabolite of MN-001). Presentation details will be disseminated as they become available. Kazuko Matsuda, M.D. Ph.D., M.P.H., Chief Medical Officer, MediciNova, Inc., commented, “We are very pleased that the two presentations were accepted at the EAS 2024 Congress. One presentation is regarding the objectives and design of the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial enrolling patients with Type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and NAFLD. The other presentation is regarding the mechanism of action of MN-001/MN-002 in lipid metabolism, particularly the effects on cholesterol efflux capacity. This is the outcome from our research collaboration with Professor Takashi Mitsui MD PhD, and Professor Masatsune Ogura MD PhD at Juntendo University to evaluate the mechanism of action of MN-001 in lipid metabolism and metabolic syndrome”. About NAFLD, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, and Hypertriglyceridemia NAFLD is considered the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome; studies have reported that 50% of patients with metabolic syndrome also have NAFLD. There is sufficient clinical and epidemiological evidence supporting the assertion that NAFLD is strongly associated with an increased prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular disease, T2DM, chronic kidney disease, and malignancy. The presence of dyslipidemia (hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, or both) is reported in 20 - 80% of NAFLD cases. About MN-001 MN-001 (tipelukast) is a novel, orally bioavailable, small molecule compound thought to exert its effects through several mechanisms to produce its anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic activity in preclinical models, including leukotriene (LT) receptor antagonism, inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDE) (mainly 3 and 4), and inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). The 5-LO/LT pathway has been postulated as a pathogenic factor in fibrosis development, and MN-001's inhibitory effect on 5-LO and the 5-LO/LT pathway is a novel approach to treat fibrosis. MN-001 has been shown to down-regulate expression of genes that promote fibrosis including LOXL2, Collagen Type 1 and TIMP-1. MN-001 has also been shown to down-regulate expression of genes that promote inflammation including CCR2 and MCP-1. In addition, MN-001 was found to inhibit triglyceride synthesis in hepatocytes by inhibiting arachidonic acid uptake. About MediciNova MediciNova, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a broad late-stage pipeline of novel small molecule therapies for inflammatory, fibrotic, and neurodegenerative diseases. Based on two compounds, MN-166 (ibudilast) and MN-001 (tipelukast), with multiple mechanisms of action and strong safety profiles, MediciNova has 11 programs in clinical development. MediciNova’s lead asset, MN-166 (ibudilast), is currently in Phase 3 for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) and is Phase 3-ready for progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). MN-166 (ibudilast) is also being evaluated in Phase 2 trials in glioblastoma, Long COVID, and substance dependence.

The meeting also approved executive compensation and a name change to 'ElectraMeccanica North America Corp.' The ElectraMeccanica Arrangement Proposal received 86.2% of the votes cast, with the closing subject to customary conditions. Positive None. Negative None. Mergers and Acquisitions Analyst The approval of the Arrangement involving the acquisition of ElectraMeccanica by Xos, Inc. represents a significant consolidation in the electric vehicle (EV) sector. This move could potentially streamline operations, reduce costs and increase market share for the combined entity. The overwhelming shareholder support, with 86.2% voting in favor, suggests confidence in the strategic rationale behind the merger. However, it's essential to consider the integration risks and the potential for cultural clashes that often accompany such transactions. The EV market is highly competitive and the success of this merger will depend on the combined entity's ability to innovate and scale up production efficiently. Legal Expert The statutory arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) suggests a structured and legally compliant process has been followed for this corporate action. The requirement for two-thirds affirmative vote and the actual 86.2% favor indicate a strong mandate for the transaction. However, the deal's closure is contingent upon court approval, which is a standard procedure to ensure that the Arrangement meets all legal and regulatory requirements. It's also noteworthy that the arrangement includes provisions for executive compensation related to the transaction, which is a common practice to align management's interests with the success of the deal. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the acquisition could lead to potential synergies, including operational efficiencies and a broader product portfolio. The market will monitor the post-merger performance closely, particularly in terms of revenue growth and cost savings. The name change to 'ElectraMeccanica North America Corp.' indicates a strategic rebranding, which could be aimed at strengthening the company's presence in the North American market. Investors should track the progress of the merger's integration phase and watch for any updates on the expected financial impact, including changes in revenue forecasts, cost structure and market expansion strategies. 03/20/2024 - 06:05 PM MESA, Ariz., March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ElectraMeccanica Vehicles Corp.

The issuance received top credit ratings in Mexico from Moody's and S&P, indicating strong financial stability and credibility. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The issuance of long-term bond certificates by Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico represents a significant financial maneuver, indicating a proactive approach to debt management. The oversubscription rate of 2.4x suggests strong investor confidence in the company's creditworthiness. It is noteworthy that the proceeds are earmarked for refinancing existing debt, which could potentially improve the company's debt profile by extending maturities and locking in fixed interest rates amidst a volatile rate environment.The interest rates, both variable and fixed, attached to the new bonds are reflective of current market conditions and the company's risk assessment by credit rating agencies. The inclusion of a Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework introduces an innovative financial instrument that aligns investor returns with the company's environmental performance, potentially appealing to an increasingly environmentally-conscious investor base. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Analyst GAP's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving ACA Level 3 certification on a portion of its airports, as outlined in its Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework, demonstrates a strategic integration of sustainability goals with its financial instruments. The step-up interest rate provisions in case of non-achievement of these targets create a direct financial incentive for the company to meet its environmental objectives, potentially reducing its operational risks associated with climate change.Moreover, the high credit ratings and the Second Party Opinion obtained from S&P suggest that GAP's sustainability practices are well-regarded and could mitigate the risk of 'greenwashing.' This could enhance the company's reputation among stakeholders and might lead to favorable borrowing terms in the future. Market Research Analyst The successful bond issuance by Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico can be seen as a barometer for the airport services industry's financial health and investor sentiment. The credit ratings assigned to the bonds, 'Aaa.mx' by Moody's and 'mxAAA' by S&P, indicate a strong vote of confidence in the sector's stability and GAP's operational efficiency. The company's strategic positioning, serving both major cities and tourist destinations in Mexico, along with its expansion into Jamaica, suggests a diversification strategy that might be well-received in the market.Additionally, the sustainability-linked aspect of the bonds could set a precedent in the industry, potentially influencing other companies to follow suit. This could pave the way for a broader adoption of sustainability-linked financial instruments in the infrastructure sector, aligning long-term financial goals with environmental and social governance criteria. 03/20/2024 - 06:23 PM GUADALAJARA, Mexico, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico, S.A.B. de C.V., (NYSE: PAC; BMV: GAP) (the “Company” or “GAP”) announced today that it successfully completed the issuance of 30 million long-term bond certificates in Mexico (Certificados Bursátiles) at a nominal value of Ps. 100 each (One hundred pesos 00/100), for a total value of Ps. 3.0 billion.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst BlackRock's launch of the BUIDL tokenized fund represents a significant step in the integration of blockchain technology into traditional financial products. The fund's structure, which allows for the tokenization of assets, could lead to increased liquidity and more efficient markets. The use of blockchain technology offers instantaneous and transparent settlement, which is a substantial improvement over the current T+2 settlement system in traditional markets.From a financial standpoint, the fund's investment in low-risk assets such as cash, U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements suggests that it is targeting investors seeking stable returns and preservation of capital. The $5 million initial investment minimum indicates that the fund is aimed at institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals. BlackRock's strategic investment in Securitize could signal a long-term commitment to digital asset infrastructure, potentially leading to more blockchain-based offerings in the future.However, there are risks associated with digital asset investments, including regulatory uncertainty and potential technological issues. Investors should also consider the interoperability challenges between digital and traditional markets, despite BNY Mellon's role in facilitating this aspect. The impact on the stock market could be gradual, as the adoption of such funds will depend on the broader acceptance of digital assets by institutional investors. Legal Expert The regulatory framework surrounding tokenized funds is an evolving landscape. BlackRock's BUIDL fund issuance under Rule 506(c) and Section 3(c)(7) indicates that it is targeting accredited investors and qualifying purchasers, which aligns with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) regulations for private placements. The appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Fund's auditor suggests a commitment to transparency and regulatory compliance.Investors need to be aware of the legal implications of holding digital assets, such as tokens. For instance, the transfer of tokens to pre-approved investors could be subject to anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) regulations. As digital assets are relatively new, there may be unforeseen legal challenges that could arise, affecting investors' confidence and the fund's operation.BlackRock's strategic investment in Securitize and the appointment of Joseph Chalom to Securitize's Board of Directors could facilitate navigating the regulatory environment, given BlackRock's experience and influence in the financial sector. Blockchain Technology Expert The tokenization of the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund represents an innovative use of blockchain technology in the asset management industry. Tokenization could democratize investor access to financial products by reducing entry barriers and allowing for fractional ownership. This could potentially disrupt the traditional fund distribution model by enabling direct peer-to-peer transfers of fund shares.Blockchain's inherent characteristics, such as immutability and distributed ledger technology, enhance the security and transparency of transactions. The involvement of established crypto infrastructure providers like Anchorage Digital Bank NA, BitGo, Coinbase and Fireblocks is indicative of the robustness of the ecosystem supporting BUIDL.While the technology holds promise, it is important to consider the technical risks, such as smart contract vulnerabilities and the scalability of the blockchain used. Additionally, the integration of digital assets into traditional financial systems will require continuous technological advancements to ensure seamless interoperability and user experience. 03/20/2024 - 06:27 PM Investors can subscribe through Securitize Markets, LLC to participate in the fund BlackRock invests in Securitize to drive transformation for digital assets infrastructure NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BlackRock today unveils its first tokenized fund issued on a public blockchain, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (“BUIDL” or the “Fund”). BUIDL will provide qualified investors with the opportunity to earn U.S. dollar yields by subscribing to the Fund through Securitize Markets, LLC. “This is the latest progression of our digital assets strategy,” said Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets. “We are focused on developing solutions in the digital assets space that help solve real problems for our clients, and we are excited to work with Securitize.” Tokenization remains a key focus of BlackRock’s digital asset strategy. Through the tokenization of the Fund, BUIDL will offer investors important benefits by enabling the issuance and trading of ownership on a blockchain, expanding investor access to on-chain offerings, providing instantaneous and transparent settlement, and allowing for transfers across platforms. BNY Mellon will enable interoperability for the Fund between digital and traditional markets. “Tokenization of securities could fundamentally transform capital markets. Today’s news demonstrates that traditional financial products are being made more accessible through digitization. Securitize is proud to be BlackRock’s transfer agent, tokenization platform and placement agent of choice in digitizing and expanding access to its investment products,” said Securitize co-founder and CEO Carlos Domingo. BUIDL seeks to offer a stable value of $1 per token and pays daily accrued dividends directly to investors' wallets as new tokens each month. The Fund invests 100% of its total assets in cash, U.S. Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements, allowing investors to earn yield while holding the token on the blockchain. Investors can transfer their tokens 24/7/365 to other pre-approved investors. Fund participants will also have flexible custody options allowing them to choose how to hold their tokens. The initial ecosystem participants in BUIDL include Anchorage Digital Bank NA, BitGo, Coinbase, and Fireblocks, among other market participants and infrastructure providers in the crypto industry. BlackRock Financial Management, Inc., will be the investment manager of the Fund and Bank of New York Mellon will serve as the custodian of the Fund’s assets and its administrator. Securitize will act as a transfer agent and tokenization platform, managing the tokenized shares and reporting on Fund subscriptions, redemptions, and distributions. Securitize Markets will act as placement agent, making the Fund available to eligible investors.

The company will file a Form 25 with the SEC to remove its securities from listing.,"Movella Announces Voluntary Delisting from Nasdaq Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Movella Holdings Inc. (MVLA) has decided to voluntarily delist its common stock and warrants from the Nasdaq Global Market. The company will file a Form 25 with the SEC to remove its securities from listing. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision by Movella Holdings Inc. to delist from the Nasdaq Global Market is a significant move that warrants a multifaceted financial analysis. Delisting can often be a red flag to investors, as it may imply underlying issues such as failing to meet listing requirements or seeking to reduce regulatory scrutiny and reporting costs. In Movella's case, the impact on liquidity is a critical factor to consider. Delisting typically results in reduced stock visibility and may deter institutional investors, potentially leading to lower trading volumes and increased volatility. Shareholders might face challenges with valuation due to the lack of a transparent, regulated market.Another aspect to consider is the strategic rationale behind such a decision. Companies sometimes delist to go private, often driven by management's desire for greater operational flexibility or in anticipation of restructuring efforts that may be easier to undertake outside the public eye. The exercise price of the warrants, set at $11.50, also deserves attention, as it may indicate management's assessment of the company's value and the potential upside they foresee. Investors should monitor the company's subsequent announcements closely for any indication of a strategic pivot or acquisition interest. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Movella's delisting raises questions about the company's market position and competitive landscape within the sensor technology sector. As a full-stack provider in a high-growth industry, Movella's departure from a major stock exchange might suggest a strategic shift that could either disrupt the market or signal a retreat from competitive pressures. The digitization of movement is a burgeoning field, intersecting with virtual reality, gaming, healthcare and industrial applications. Movella's performance and strategic decisions are likely to influence market dynamics, including partnerships, customer acquisition strategies and innovation trajectories.Furthermore, Movella's delisting may alter investor perception of the sector, potentially affecting the valuation of similar companies. Investors often look to comparable firms to gauge market sentiment and growth potential. Movella's move could prompt a reassessment of risk and opportunity within the industry, especially if the delisting is followed by significant business model changes or shifts in technology focus. Legal Expert Legally, the process of delisting requires adherence to SEC regulations, including the filing of a Form 25. Movella's notification to Nasdaq and the planned SEC filing indicate a compliance with procedural norms. However, it's essential to dissect the implications of delisting from a regulatory perspective. The reduction in disclosure and regulatory obligations post-delisting can have both benefits and drawbacks. While it may provide Movella with more operational secrecy and reduced costs associated with compliance, it also diminishes the transparency that benefits shareholders. Investors should be aware that the reduced oversight could affect their ability to make informed decisions based on comprehensive and audited financial information.Additionally, the legal ramifications for warrant holders must be considered. The process and timeline for exercising warrants post-delisting and any changes in terms, will be important information for warrant holders to obtain. Typically, such corporate actions are subject to shareholder approval and the interests of minority shareholders must be carefully balanced against the company's stated strategic objectives. 03/20/2024 - 05:30 PM HENDERSON, Nev., March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Movella Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: MVLA) (“Movella” or the “Company”), a leading full-stack provider of sensors, software, and analytics that enable the digitization of movement, announced today that it has notified the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) of its decision to voluntarily delist its shares of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the “Common Stock”) and its warrants exercisable for one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 (the “Warrants”) from the Nasdaq Global Market. Movella intends to file a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) to remove its Common Stock and Warrants from listing on the Nasdaq Global Market on or about April 1, 2024 and deregister such securities under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and as a result, Movella expects that the last trading day of its Common Stock and Warrants on the Nasdaq Global Market will be on or about April 11, 2024. Movella will remain subject to such reporting obligations under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. As previously noted in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 2, 2023, the Company had received written notice from Nasdaq that the Company was not in compliance with the minimum bid price required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) based upon the closing bid price of the Common Stock for the 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the notice. Additionally, as previously disclosed in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on November 16, 2023, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq on November 16, 2023 indicating that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq’s Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) because it did not timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 (the “Quarterly Report”) with the SEC. On January 26, 2024, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it has been granted an exception to enable it to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) subject to the requirement that, on or before May 13, 2024, the Company must file the Quarterly Report, as required by Rule 5250(c)(1). Following the delisting of Movella’s Common Stock and Warrants from trading on Nasdaq, any trading in such securities would only occur in privately negotiated sales and potentially on an over-the-counter market. Movella expects to have its Common Stock and Warrants quoted on a market operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. (the “OTC”) so that a trading market may continue to exist for such securities. There is no guarantee, however, that a broker will continue to make a market in Movella’s Common Stock and Warrants and that trading thereof will continue on an OTC market or otherwise.

Stevanato Group Announces Public Offering of Ordinary Shares,2024-03-20T21:12:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,Stevanato Group (STVN) announces a $300 million underwritten public offering of ordinary shares. The Company and a major shareholder are each offering $150 million. The underwriters have an option to purchase additional shares. The net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and investment activities. Morgan Stanley and William Blair are the joint book-running managers for the Offering.,"Stevanato Group Announces Public Offering of Ordinary Shares Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Stevanato Group (STVN) announces a $300 million underwritten public offering of ordinary shares. The Company and a major shareholder are each offering $150 million. The underwriters have an option to purchase additional shares. The net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and investment activities. Morgan Stanley and William Blair are the joint book-running managers for the Offering. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The public offering by Stevanato Group, involving both a direct sale of shares and a secondary offering by a major shareholder, is a significant event for investors to consider. The dual nature of the offering, with half of the shares being sold by the company and half by an affiliate, suggests a liquidity event for the major shareholder while also providing the company with capital for investment and operational flexibility. The amount, $300 million, is substantial and indicates a strategic move to strengthen the company's balance sheet.From a financial perspective, the use of proceeds for 'general corporate purposes' is a broad definition that investors typically scrutinize for more specific intentions. The company's mention of satisfying ongoing investment activities could hint at expansion or scaling operations, which might be a positive indicator of growth. However, the lack of specificity could also be seen as a potential red flag for investors who prefer transparent and targeted use of capital.The underwriters' role, with Morgan Stanley and William Blair at the helm, implies confidence in the offering's success, given their reputation and expertise in the market. The 15% additional shares option for underwriters is a common practice that can stabilize the share price post-offering but also dilutes current shareholders' stakes. Market Research Analyst Stevanato Group's positioning in the drug containment and delivery market is critical to understanding the potential impact of this capital raise. Their role in the supply chain for pharmaceuticals and biotech products is increasingly important given the industry's growth and the rising demand for innovative drug delivery solutions. The offering may be a strategic move to capitalize on market trends, such as the push for more complex biologics that require specialized containment solutions.Investors should also consider the market's reaction to similar offerings in the past and the current market conditions. If the sector is experiencing a bullish trend, this could be an opportune time for Stevanato Group to raise capital. Conversely, a bearish market might lead to a less favorable reception. Additionally, the sale by the major shareholder could be interpreted in multiple ways: as a routine portfolio adjustment, a lack of confidence in the company's future, or a simple cash-out strategy. Legal Expert The legal framework of this offering, particularly the use of an automatic shelf registration statement on Form F-3, is designed for non-U.S. companies allowing them to register securities with the SEC for offerings that can take place over a three-year period. This mechanism provides the company with the flexibility to go to the market quickly when conditions are favorable. It also implies that the company has met certain regulatory prerequisites, which can be reassuring for investors.However, it's important to note the legal disclaimer that the offering is subject to state and jurisdictional securities laws. This means that the sale is not a blanket permission to sell shares anywhere and investors must be aware of potential legal restrictions or requirements. Furthermore, the 30-day option for underwriters to purchase additional shares is a legal provision that needs to be factored into the investment decision, as it could affect the share price and the overall dilution of equity. 03/20/2024 - 05:12 PM PIOMBINO DESE, Italy--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Stevanato Group S.p.A. (NYSE: STVN) (“Stevanato Group,” or the “Company”), a leading global provider of drug containment, drug delivery and diagnostic solutions to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and life sciences industries, today announced the launch of an underwritten public offering of an aggregate of $300,000,000 of its ordinary shares.

About Credit Acceptance We make vehicle ownership possible by providing innovative financing solutions that enable automobile dealers to sell vehicles to consumers regardless of their credit history. Our financing programs are offered through a nationwide network of automobile dealers who benefit from sales of vehicles to consumers who otherwise could not obtain financing; from repeat and referral sales generated by these same customers; and from sales to customers responding to advertisements for our financing programs, but who actually end up qualifying for traditional financing. Without our financing programs, consumers are often unable to purchase vehicles, or they purchase unreliable ones. Further, as we report to the three national credit reporting agencies, an important ancillary benefit of our programs is that we provide consumers with an opportunity to improve their lives by improving their credit score and move on to more traditional sources of financing.

Jess Jankowski, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented: “2023 started out with strong first and second quarters, and while the third and fourth quarters experienced supply chain issues that affected profitability, we ended the year feeling confident that we have the right plan in place to better manage critical areas as well as add efficiency to our operations. “We also added much needed breathing room in terms of capital and feel that we have the right financing in place to set us up for a strong 2024. We’re looking at $35 million shipped and open P.O.s so far in 2024, and we expect more 2024 orders to come in during the second and third quarters,” said Jankowski. Kevin Cureton, Chief Operating Officer, commented: “During Q4, we continued the work to transform our management practices to improve both execution and accountability within our teams. This work, particularly the use of key performance indicators, is a core aspect of our plans for delivering improved results in 2024. “Aligned with the process changes, we brought on an experienced Buyer to join our Purchasing Manager who, along with our VP of Operations, have made major improvements to our supply chain process and operations management efforts,” added Cureton. 2023 Q4 Financial Information Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights Revenue for the fourth quarter was $8 million, vs. $8.3 million for the same period in 2022. Revenue for the full year was $37.3 million, which was the same for 2022. Additional capital was secured with a $6 million financing package announced in March 2024. For the full year of 2023: Solésence revenue was $25.2million, up 9% from $23.1 million in 2022. Personal Care Ingredients revenue was $9.3 million, down 17% from $11.1 million in 2022.

The largest part of the 2024 loss was driven by inefficiencies and supply chain issues in Q4, and $1.3 million in legal fees relating to litigation. We have seen improvement in our operations already in Q1 of 2024, as well as lower litigation costs in Q4 that we expect to remain lower as we work toward a positive resolution.

The company provides guidance for Q1 and fiscal 2024, expecting net sales between $3.97 billion to $4.07 billion and diluted income per share between $5.71 to $6.22. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported 19% increase in Q4 net sales and 16% increase in fiscal 2023 net sales for Five Below, Inc. suggests a robust consumer demand for their value-oriented products. This growth is significant considering the retail sector's sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer spending patterns. The expansion of store count by 15.2% indicates a bullish approach to physical retail growth, which is a departure from the industry trend of shifting towards e-commerce. However, investors should monitor whether this aggressive expansion can sustain its profitability in the face of potential economic headwinds. Financial Analyst Five Below's earnings per share (EPS) growth of 19% in Q4 and 15% for the fiscal year aligns with the net sales increase, reflecting operational efficiency. However, the impact of the 53rd week should be considered as it artificially inflates year-over-year comparisons. The company's effective tax rate has slightly increased, which could marginally affect net income. It's also worth noting the share repurchase of approximately 500,000 shares, which often signals confidence in the company's future performance and can be accretive to EPS. Investors should balance these factors with the company's guidance for fiscal 2024, which appears conservative with an expected flat to 3% increase in comparable sales. Retail Industry Analyst Five Below's strategic focus on the Five Beyond format stores and the planned store conversions suggests an evolution of their business model to potentially increase their average transaction value. While the company's shrink headwinds—loss of inventory due to theft or error—have been higher than anticipated, their proactive approach to implement shrink mitigation initiatives could improve operational efficiency in the long term. However, the full benefits of these initiatives may not be immediately reflected in the financials. The planned expansion of distribution centers indicates a commitment to scale operations and improve distribution efficiency, which is critical in maintaining a competitive edge in the low-margin discount retail industry. 03/20/2024 - 04:01 PM Q4 Net Sales Increase of 19% with a Comparable Sales Increase of 3.1%; Q4 EPS Increase of 19% Fiscal 2023 Net Sales Increase of 16% with a Comparable Sales Increase of 2.8%; Fiscal 2023 EPS Increase of 15% Provides First Quarter and Fiscal 2024 Guidance PHILADELPHIA, PA, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Five Below, Inc.

In fiscal 2023, we opened a record 205 new stores and ended the year with over half of our comparable stores in the Five Beyond format. The benefit of strong sales performance to our profitability was offset by higher than anticipated shrink headwinds, resulting in earnings at the low end of our guidance range."" Mr. Anderson continued, “We have implemented additional shrink mitigation initiatives based on our 2023 learnings. However, we expect the resulting benefits to take some time to realize, and therefore, we have not included any associated improvement in our outlook this year.

Capital Southwest Announces New $150 MM Secured Credit Facility,2024-03-20T20:01:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Capital Southwest  announced its subsidiary, Capital Southwest SPV , entered a $150 million senior secured revolving credit facility with Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, expandable to $400 million.

The facility bears interest at three-month Term SOFR plus 2.50% until March 20, 2027, with maturity on March 20, 2029. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Capital Southwest's new senior secured revolving credit facility is a notable development for the company. A revolving credit facility, such as the one established with Deutsche Bank, is a flexible financing tool that allows the borrower to draw down, repay and re-borrow funds as needed within the credit limit. The initial commitment of $150 million, with the potential to increase to $200 million and further to $400 million through an accordion feature, indicates a strong confidence from lenders in Capital Southwest's financial health and growth prospects.From a financial perspective, the interest rate being tied to the three-month Term SOFR with an additional margin of 2.50% is competitive and reflects current market conditions. This rate structure is beneficial for Capital Southwest as it provides an element of predictability in their financing costs during the revolving period, which is important for financial planning and forecasting. The non-recourse nature of the facility to Capital Southwest, securing the SPV's obligations with the SPV's assets, is a risk mitigation measure that protects the parent company's balance sheet.The facility's maturity date in 2029 gives Capital Southwest a long runway to utilize the funds for growth initiatives. This could potentially include acquisitions or expansion of their middle market business portfolio. The availability of such a credit line could be a signal to investors that the company is poised for strategic moves that could enhance shareholder value over time. Market Research Analyst Capital Southwest's establishment of a new SPV Facility with Deutsche Bank is reflective of a broader industry trend where business development companies (BDCs) are seeking to diversify their funding sources. For a BDC, having access to a sizable credit facility with an accordion feature provides not just capital for growth, but also a competitive edge in the market to act on investment opportunities swiftly.Given that BDCs like Capital Southwest are often judged by their ability to effectively manage and deploy capital, this credit facility could enhance the company's reputation among middle market businesses seeking financial partners. It could also influence the perception of Capital Southwest's operational capabilities and risk management among investors, potentially impacting the stock's attractiveness.Moreover, the timing of the credit facility, with its long-term horizon, aligns with the current economic cycle where businesses are looking to recover and grow post-pandemic. The flexibility and size of the facility may enable Capital Southwest to capitalize on market conditions and invest in companies that could thrive in the economic upturn, which could ultimately drive returns for Capital Southwest investors. 03/20/2024 - 04:01 PM DALLAS, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Capital Southwest Corporation (“Capital Southwest” or “we”"") (Nasdaq: CSWC), an internally managed business development company focused on providing flexible financing solutions to support the acquisition and growth of middle market businesses, announced today that its wholly owned subsidiary, Capital Southwest SPV LLC (the “SPV”), entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility (the “SPV Facility”) with Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch. The SPV Facility provides for $150 million of initial commitments with (i) an increase to $200 million of total commitments on the earlier of (a) June 20, 2024 or (b) the date requested by the Company, in its sole discretion, and (ii) an accordion feature that allows increases up to $400 million of total commitments from new and existing lenders on the same terms and conditions as the existing commitments. Advances under the SPV Facility bear interest at three-month Term SOFR plus an applicable margin of 2.50% during the revolving period ending on March 20, 2027. The SPV’s obligations to the lenders are secured by a first lien interest in all of the SPV’s assets but are non-recourse to Capital Southwest. The SPV Facility matures on March 20, 2029. Michael Sarner, Chief Financial Officer, commented, “We are pleased to continue our long-standing relationship with Deutsche Bank through the creation of a new SPV Facility. The SPV Facility further diversifies our sources of capital and provides significant funding flexibility as we continue to grow our balance sheet. We expect to continue to grow total commitments under this Credit Facility in lockstep with our asset growth.” About Capital Southwest Capital Southwest Corporation (Nasdaq: CSWC) is a Dallas, Texas-based, internally managed business development company with approximately $1.4 billion in investments at fair value as of December 31, 2023.

The company's financial results for Q4 2023 show a net loss of £7.7 million. NuCana expects key data readouts for all programs in 2024, with a cash runway into 2025. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent update from NuCana plc regarding their financial results and clinical development progress is significant for investors monitoring the biotech sector. The company's reported cash and cash equivalents, which have declined from £41.9 million at the end of the previous year to £17.2 million, reflect a substantial burn rate that is critical for gauging the firm's financial health and sustainability. The reduced net loss from £32.0 million to £27.6 million year-over-year suggests some level of cost control or increased efficiency in operations. However, the ongoing cash burn will likely necessitate future capital raising efforts, which could dilute existing shareholders or introduce debt financing risks.Furthermore, the anticipated milestones for 2024, including data readouts from several Phase 2 studies, could serve as significant catalysts for the company's stock price. Positive results may drive investor optimism and enhance the company's valuation, while disappointing outcomes could have the opposite effect. The extended cash runway into 2025 provides some reassurance to investors that the company has sufficient funds to reach these critical milestones without immediate additional financing pressures. Medical Research Analyst NuCana's updates on its ProTide therapeutics, particularly NUC-3373 and NUC-7738, are noteworthy for stakeholders interested in oncology and drug development. The ProTide technology aims to improve the pharmacological properties of nucleoside analogs, potentially leading to more effective and safer cancer treatments. The successful recruitment of 171 patients for the randomized Phase 2 study of NUC-3373 is an important step towards validating this technology. The comparison of NUC-3373-based regimens with standard chemotherapy could redefine treatment protocols if the efficacy and safety profiles are superior.For NUC-7738, the preliminary data indicating potential synergy with pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 therapy, in melanoma patients who have failed prior immunotherapy is particularly intriguing. This could position NUC-7738 as a valuable addition to the treatment landscape for resistant or refractory melanoma, a condition with limited options after immunotherapy failure. The full data readouts in 2024 will be important for understanding the true potential of these ProTide transformations in the competitive oncology market. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, NuCana's progress in its clinical development program reflects broader trends in the pharmaceutical industry's focus on targeted cancer therapies. The ProTide platform differentiates NuCana within the oncology space, potentially offering a competitive edge should the trials yield positive results. The market's response to these updates is likely to hinge on the perceived potential of the ProTide technology to capture market share in the oncology treatment landscape.It's important to note that the oncology drug market is highly competitive, with many players investing heavily in novel therapies. NuCana's success will depend not only on the clinical efficacy and safety of its ProTide therapeutics but also on its ability to navigate regulatory hurdles, secure marketing approvals and establish commercialization partnerships or strategies. The anticipation of key data readouts in 2024 positions NuCana as a company to watch within the industry, with potential implications for market dynamics depending on the outcomes of these studies. 03/20/2024 - 04:01 PM Announced Encouraging Updates from NUC-3373 and NUC-7738 Demonstrating Promising Efficacy and Safety Pipeline Continues to Advance with Key Data Readouts Expected for All Programs in 2024 Randomized Phase 2 Study of 171 Second-Line Colorectal Cancer Patients Fully Recruited Anticipated Cash Runway into 2025 EDINBURGH, United Kingdom, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NuCana plc (NASDAQ: NCNA) announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023 and provided an update on its broad clinical development program with its transformative ProTide therapeutics. As of December 31, 2023, NuCana had cash and cash equivalents of £17.2 million compared to £17.8 million as of September 30, 2023 and £41.9 million as of December 31, 2022. NuCana continues to advance its various clinical programs and reported a net loss of £7.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, as compared to a net loss of £15.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was £27.6 million, compared to a net loss of £32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Basic and diluted loss per share was £0.14 for the quarter and £0.53 for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to £0.29 per share for the comparable quarter and £0.61 for the year ended December 31, 2022. “In 2023, we announced data that demonstrated encouraging signals of efficacy and favorable safety profiles for our ProTides, NUC-3373 and NUC-7738,” said Hugh S. Griffith, NuCana’s Founder and Chief Executive Officer. “Working towards our mission of improving treatment outcomes for patients with cancer by developing more effective and safer medicines, we look forward to providing important data readouts across our pipeline in 2024.” Mr. Griffith continued: “Our development programs for both NUC-3373 and NUC-7738 are progressing well. NUC-3373, our ProTide transformation of 5-FU, is being evaluated in three ongoing clinical studies. Our randomized Phase 2 study is comparing NUC-3373 in combination with irinotecan, leucovorin and bevacizumab (NUFIRI + bev) with the standard of care, 5-FU in combination with irinotecan, leucovorin and bevacizumab (FOLFIRI + bev) for the second-line treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. We have now fully recruited all 171 patients to the study and we remain on track to announce data from this study in 2024. Additionally, we are completing our Phase 1b/2 study of NUFIRI + bev and NUFOX + bev in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. We recently presented data from this study demonstrating that NUFIRI + bev and NUFOX + bev showed a favorable safety profile and encouraging signs of efficacy, including tumor volume reductions. In addition, several patients achieved a longer progression-free survival (PFS) on NUC-3373-based regimens as compared to the PFS achieved in their first-line treatment with 5-FU-based therapy. Lastly, we remain on track to announce data in 2024 from our Phase 1b/2 study of NUC-3373 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with solid tumors and in combination with docetaxel in patients with lung cancer.” Mr. Griffith continued: “Moving to NUC-7738, we recently presented data from the Phase 2 part of the Phase 1/2 study of NUC-7738 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with melanoma. These data showed tumor volume reductions and prolonged time on treatment and indicated that NUC-7738 may potentiate the activity of anti-PD-1 agents in patients who were refractory to, or progressed on, prior immunotherapy, including anti-PD-1 therapy. We look forward to sharing additional updates from this study in 2024.” Mr. Griffith concluded, “With a cash runway that is expected to extend into 2025, we look forward to providing a number of important data updates in the coming year as we continue to advance our pipeline of ProTides.” 2024 Anticipated Milestones NUC-3373 (a ProTide transformation of 5-FU) In 2024, NuCana expects to: Announce data from the randomized Phase 2 (NuTide:323) study of NUFIRI + bev compared to the standard of care FOLFIRI + bev for the second-line treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer;Announce data from the Phase 1b/2 (NuTide:302) study of NUFIRI + bev and NUFOX + bev for the second-line treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer; andAnnounce data from the Phase 1b/2 (NuTide:303) modular study of NUC-3373 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with solid tumors and in combination with docetaxel in patients with lung cancer.

(Nasdaq: MDAI) secures a $30.0 million prepaid advance and standby equity purchase agreement to support commercialization and research activities. The agreement with a long-only investor includes a fixed conversion price of $3.16 and provides flexibility for additional draws. CEO Peter M. Carlson highlights the importance of this funding for strategic imperatives and commercialization initiatives, emphasizing recent milestones in the U.K. and the U.S. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Spectral AI's entry into a SEPA with a long-only investor is a strategic financial maneuver aimed at bolstering the company's capital structure. The $30.0 million capacity under the SEPA, with an initial $5.0 million funded at a fixed conversion price, provides the company with immediate liquidity. This liquidity is essential for Spectral AI as it transitions from research and development to commercialization, particularly for its medical diagnostic technologies in wound care.The fixed conversion price set at 120% of the three-day volume weighted average price before each funding event indicates investor confidence in the company's future value. This is a positive signal to the market, as it suggests expectations of upward price movements. However, investors should be aware of the dilutive effect of convertible instruments, which can lead to shareholder value dilution if the company's stock price increases significantly.The structured payment terms, including the 7% payment premium on the prepaid advance, indicate a higher cost of capital, reflecting the risk the investor is taking. This could be a point of concern for stakeholders, as it may imply that the company's access to traditional financing options is limited or comes at a higher cost. Overall, this funding strategy appears to support Spectral AI's growth initiatives but also underscores the need for careful monitoring of the company's future earnings and stock performance. Market Research Analyst The announcement of Spectral AI's SEPA highlights the company's focus on expanding its commercial footprint in the medical diagnostics sector, particularly in wound care. The strategic use of non-dilutive funding in conjunction with the SEPA demonstrates a multi-faceted approach to financing that seeks to mitigate shareholder dilution while securing necessary capital.Market response to such financial instruments can be mixed. On one hand, the flexibility offered to the company in terms of additional drawdowns could be viewed favorably as it suggests a more controlled approach to financing. On the other hand, the potential increase in shares outstanding upon conversion could lead to apprehension about future earnings per share dilution.The commercialization of Spectral AI's wound care technology, especially in high-need areas such as diabetic foot ulcers and burns, is likely to be closely watched by the market. Success in clinical trials and subsequent product adoption could significantly impact the company's revenue streams and market position. Investors and industry observers will be interested in the company's ability to leverage the SEPA funding to accelerate these commercialization efforts and create sustainable long-term growth. Medical Technology Analyst The deployment of Spectral AI's burn device in the U.K. and the focus on clinical trials in the U.S. represent significant steps in the company's strategic imperatives. The move towards commercializing treatments for diabetic foot ulcers and burns indicates the company's commitment to addressing areas with substantial patient needs.Medical technology companies like Spectral AI are often subject to rigorous regulatory pathways and the ability to secure funding through instruments like SEPA can be critical to maintaining momentum in product development and clinical trials. The timing of this funding aligns with the company's stated goals of advancing its technology to market readiness.Investors will be interested in the potential market size for Spectral AI's wound care diagnostics, as well as the competitive landscape. With the company's technology aimed at faster and more accurate treatment decisions, the impact on healthcare outcomes and cost savings could be substantial. These factors, combined with successful commercialization efforts, could lead to significant returns on investment, although the inherent risks in medical technology development should not be overlooked. 03/20/2024 - 02:45 PM Issuance of Convertible Instrument Balances Certainty, Timing, and ExecutionCapital Supports Strategic Imperatives and Commercialization Initiatives DALLAS, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Spectral AI, Inc. (Nasdaq: MDAI) (“Spectral AI” or the “Company”), an artificial intelligence (AI) company focused on medical diagnostics for faster and more accurate treatment decisions in wound care, today announced that it has entered into a fixed price prepaid advance and standby equity purchase agreement (“SEPA”) with a long-only investor.

Any additional draws above the prepaid advances are at the sole discretion of the Company. “We are pleased to announce this equity funding as we pivot to commercialization while continuing our research and development activities,” said Peter M. Carlson, CEO of Spectral AI. “Together with our non-dilutive funding from various U.S. Government agencies, this new equity-linked instrument supports our strategic imperatives. We deployed our first burn device in the U.K. last week and continue to focus on clinical trials in the U.S., accelerating towards the commercialization of the diabetic foot ulcer indication and the burn indication. These are exciting milestones for Spectral AI, and I thank the team for their continued contributions to these key initiatives.” Key terms of the SEPA and related documents include: A prepaid advance in total of $12.5 million, paid as (i) $5.0 million at the initial closing, (ii) $5.0 million upon the effectiveness of the initial Registration Statement to be filed by the Company, and (iii) $2.5 million to be paid 60 days later.Maturity of each tranche of the prepaid advance is 12 months from the date of the related funding.Following a 45-day grace period, the prepaid advance amortizes over 7 months in the amount of $1.75 million of principal per month plus a 7% payment premium.

The vaccine, targeting norovirus-related acute gastroenteritis, is a significant endeavor, as norovirus is a leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide and poses a substantial burden on healthcare systems. The completion of subject enrollment in the NEST-IN1 Phase 2b clinical trial is a positive indicator of the company's operational efficiency and adherence to development timelines, which is often a concern for investors monitoring clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies.From a financial perspective, the reported increase in cash reserves, primarily due to a successful public offering, provides the company with a more robust runway to fund ongoing trials and development efforts. This is a critical factor in assessing the company's ability to sustain operations without the immediate need for additional capital raises. The reported increase in R&D expenses aligns with the company's developmental stage and reflects its investment in HIL-214, which could be seen as a commitment to bringing the vaccine to market. However, it's important to monitor whether these investments translate into successful trial outcomes and eventual product approval. Financial Analyst The financial results from HilleVax, Inc. reveal a strategic emphasis on research and development, evidenced by the significant increase in R&D expenses year-over-year. This investment reflects the company's stage of growth and the critical nature of HIL-214's development cycle. The uptick in general and administrative expenses can be attributed to the expansion of the company's workforce, which is a natural progression for a company scaling up its operations. The net proceeds from the public offering have bolstered the company's cash position, which is a reassuring sign for investors as it suggests a decreased likelihood of short-term liquidity issues.Despite these positive financial indicators, the reported net loss for both the fourth quarter and the full year signals that the company is still in a heavy investment phase, which is typical for clinical-stage biopharmaceutical firms. The shift from other expenses to other income, mainly due to interest income, is an encouraging sign of financial prudence. Investors should weigh the potential of HIL-214 against the inherent risks of investing in a company at this stage of clinical development, keeping an eye on the upcoming topline data from the NEST-IN1 study as a critical inflection point for the company's valuation. Market Research Analyst The norovirus vaccine market is an area of unmet medical need with significant commercial potential. HilleVax's focus on this space could position the company well if HIL-214 proves to be effective and safe. The anticipation of topline data from the NEST-IN1 study in mid-2024 is a pivotal event that could impact the company's stock performance. Positive results could lead to a surge in investor confidence, while negative results could have the opposite effect.It is essential to consider the competitive landscape and the potential market size for a norovirus vaccine. With a successful outcome, HilleVax could capture a substantial market share, given the high incidence of norovirus infections globally. The company's strategic investments in manufacturing activities also indicate foresight in preparing for potential commercialization, which is a positive sign for long-term planning. Investors should monitor the progress of the NEST-IN1 study closely as it is likely to be a significant determinant of HilleVax's future business trajectory and market positioning. 03/20/2024 - 04:00 PM Topline data from NEST-IN1 Phase 2B clinical study of HIL-214 in infants expected in mid-2024 Enrollment for NEST-IN1 study completed in Q2 2023 $303.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2023 BOSTON, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HilleVax, Inc. (Nasdaq: HLVX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel vaccines, today reported financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, highlighted recent progress and outlined key upcoming milestones for HIL-214, the company’s investigational virus-like particle (VLP) based vaccine for the prevention of moderate-to-severe norovirus-related acute gastroenteritis. “Over the past year, we made significant progress with HIL-214, our vaccine candidate for the prevention of moderate-to-severe norovirus related acute gastroenteritis. We have continued to progress the NEST-IN1 clinical trial and remain on track to report topline data by mid-2024,” said Rob Hershberg, MD, PhD, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of HilleVax. “We have also made good progress on our manufacturing activities for HIL-214 in support of continued development in subsequent registrational trials for infants and older adults.” Recent Business Highlights In Q1 2024, HilleVax announced the appointment of Sean McLoughlin as Chief Operating Officer.In Q3 2023, HilleVax announced the closing of an underwritten public offering of 9,200,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $12.50 per share for gross proceeds of $115.0 million.In Q3 2023, HilleVax initiated three clinical trials supporting the advancement of HIL-214, including NOR-109, a Phase 1 clinical trial of HIL-214 in Japanese infants, NOR-206, a Phase 2 clinical trial co-administering HIL-214 with other standard infant vaccinations, and NOR-215, a Phase 2 serology study of HIL-214 in adults. As of October 2023, HilleVax has completed enrollment of subjects in all three clinical trials.In Q2 2023, HilleVax announced completion of enrollment of the NEST-IN1 (Norovirus Efficacy and Safety Trial for INfants) Phase 2b clinical trial with over 3,000 subjects enrolled in six countries. Upcoming Expected Milestones Topline safety and clinical efficacy data from NEST-IN1 in mid-2024. Full Year 2023 Financial Results As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $303.5 million and $279.4 million, respectively. The increase was due to $107.8 million of net proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in an underwritten public offering. Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter 2023 were $33.3 million and $106.7 million for the full year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $17.6 million for the fourth quarter 2022 and $45.9 million for the full year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased activities for the development of HIL-214 and the growth in the number of R&D employees.

Financial Analyst UMH Properties, Inc.'s publication of its 2023 Annual Report provides investors with comprehensive insights into the company's financial health and operational performance. As a REIT specializing in manufactured home communities, UMH's portfolio expansion and site development are key indicators of its growth trajectory. The disclosed number of communities and homesites suggests a scale of operation that could leverage economies of scale.Investors should assess occupancy rates, rental income stability and expense management within the report to gauge the REIT's efficiency. Additionally, the joint venture with Nuveen Real Estate is an aspect to watch, as partnerships in real estate can lead to strategic growth opportunities. However, the interest rate environment and housing market dynamics are external factors that can significantly impact UMH's performance, given the sensitivity of real estate to these variables.

Real Estate Investment Expert UMH's operational focus on manufactured home communities is a niche within the REIT sector that offers distinct advantages, such as lower construction costs and quicker development times compared to traditional housing.

This leap in bARR from $0.23 million in 2022 to $2.94 million in 2023, coupled with a 4,800% increase in RPO, reflects a strong market fit and potential for recurring revenue streams, which is a positive indicator for investors looking at the company's future revenue predictability and growth potential.Furthermore, the strategic cost-saving measures leading to a 52% reduction in operating expenses, despite a decline in total revenue, demonstrate a focused approach to achieving operational efficiency. The decrease in net loss and improved Adjusted EBITDA loss also suggest a trajectory towards financial stabilization. However, it is important to note the relatively low revenue base, which indicates that while the company is gaining traction, it is still in the early stages of scaling up. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the results presented by authID Inc. show a mixture of progress and challenges. The company's ability to raise $17.6 million through financing rounds and a debt-to-equity conversion is a strong sign of investor confidence and provides necessary capital for continued product development and market expansion. This is important for a company operating in the competitive cybersecurity space, where innovation is key to staying ahead.However, the reported net loss of $19.6 million, even though improved from the previous year, indicates that the company is still far from profitability. The reduction in revenue year-over-year also raises questions about the company's ability to quickly monetize its offerings and replace revenue streams from discontinued products. Investors should weigh the potential for future revenue growth against the current burn rate and consider the implications for long-term sustainability. Cybersecurity Expert The demand for advanced biometric identity verification and authentication solutions is driven by the increasing sophistication of cybersecurity threats, such as deepfakes and phishing schemes. authID's focus on multi-layered authentication platforms and deepfake detection positions the company at the forefront of addressing critical security concerns. This is particularly relevant as generative AI becomes more prevalent, potentially escalating the frequency and effectiveness of cyber attacks.The company's investment in product innovation and the renewal of their ISO 27001:2013 Certification underscores their commitment to maintaining high standards of information security management. For enterprises concerned with cybersecurity, the speed and accuracy of authID's platform, as well as their ability to offer seamless user convenience, could be a significant differentiator in the marketplace. 03/20/2024 - 04:00 PM Momentum drives $4 million in signed contract RPO value, a 4,800% increase over 2022Accelerates realization of the Company’s original June 2024 signed contracts bARR target of $3 million by 6 months Management to Host Conference Call Today at 5:30 p.m. EDT DENVER, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- authID Inc. (Nasdaq: AUID), a leading provider of innovative biometric identity verification and authentication solutions, today reported financial and operating results for the full year ended December 31, 2023. Commenting on these results, Rhon Daguro, authID CEO, said, “Our efforts in 2023—the strengthening of our financial foundation, addition of new identity domain sales and engineering talent, and application of a proven sales discipline to our engagements that generated a robust sales pipeline—have positioned authID for growth in biometric identity verification and authentication. Our momentum in booking contracts with bARR of $3 million in only six months, and not 12 months as originally planned, attests to the demand for our fast, accurate and user-friendly solutions that fight rampant authentication fraud attributed to compromised passwords and devices. Our patented identity life-cycle platform unleashes the speed and power of biometrics to ensure cyber-savvy enterprises “Know Who’s Behind the Device” for every customer or employee login and transaction, with seamless user convenience, in a market-leading 700 milliseconds. “With generative AI predicted to increase the effectiveness and frequency of relentless phishing schemes, deepfakes and fraud attacks, authID’s multi-layered authentication platform defends against these attacks with best-in-class deepfake detection and seamless, trusted biometric authentication that together outperform the competition. Looking ahead, I am confident that authID will reward the trust of our valued investors with continued market momentum by growing our sales pipeline and realizing our 2024 bARR target of $9 million, a triple target over 2023.” Financial Results for the 12 Months Ended December 31, 2023 The following highlights comprise results from continuing operations, including certain Non-GAAP measures: Total revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was $0.2 million, compared with total revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 of $0.5 million. The reduction was primarily attributed to revenue from a legacy authentication product that was discontinued in April 2022. Verified license revenue was unchanged at $0.2 million for both 2023 and 2022.Operating expenses for the twelve-month period in 2023 declined by 52% to $10.9 million, compared with $22.8 million for 2022. The reduced expenditure reflects the Company’s cost-saving measures taken in the first half of 2023, resulting in lower headcount costs and lower third-party vendor costs.Loss from continuing operations, for the twelve-month period in 2023 improved to $19.6 million, of which non-cash and one-time severance charges were $10.9 million. This compared with a net loss of $23.7 million, of which $12.3 million were non-cash and one-time severance charges, for 2022.Net loss per share for continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 improved to $3.19, compared with $7.72 per share for the prior year.Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 were $10.2 million.Adjusted EBITDA loss (Non-GAAP, as defined below) for Fiscal Year 2023 improved to $8.7 million, compared with $11.4 million, for 2022.For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Company secured gross and net amount of Booked Annual Recurring Revenue (bARR, Non-GAAP, as defined below) of $2.94 million compared to $0.23 million of bARR signed in 2022.The Company’s Remaining Performance Obligation (“RPO”) as of December 31, 2023 was $4.03 million, representing the contractual commitments of signed customer contracts, which we anticipate recognizing as revenue over the next 3 years, as they go live. This represents a 4,800% increase compared to the $0.08 million of RPO (Deferred Revenue) of contracts signed in 2022.The company also bolstered its financial position in 2023 by completing financing rounds in May and November 2023, securing a combined $17.6 million in gross proceeds and a debt-to-equity conversion of almost $9 million. These measures, combined with cost-cutting efforts and a July reverse stock split, helped authID regain compliance with Nasdaq listing rules and provided the capital needed to secure critical identity-domain experts and deliver on product innovation. The impact of the stock split on capital structure has been retroactively applied to all periods presented herein. Refer to Table 1 for reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure). Operational Highlights for 2023 and recent months Continued Daguro, “Our best of breed team for sales and execution, steeped in identity knowledge, has continually set and surpassed high sales goals, validated strong market demand and fit for our biometric identity products. We have delivered significant customer wins for both workforce and consumer use-cases, across financial services, healthcare, and the digital economy,” said Rhon Daguro, CEO of authID. “We remain committed to delivering product innovation that stays ahead of fraud trends and amplifies our thought leadership with our customers.” Strengthened its management expertise with the appointment of Rhon Daguro as CEO, the reconstitution of its Corporate Board of Directors, and the August appointment of Ed Sellitto as CFO.Positioned for strong growth in biometric identity verification and authentication by adding new identity domain talent with the appointment of new Sales leaders in July 2023 and additional expertise in sales, customer success and engineering in January 2024. Hiring proven expertise in sales management and deep identity domain knowledge will be instrumental in strengthening our market position, accelerating authID’s growth trajectory, and increasing shareholder value.Signed new customer contracts valued in the aggregate at $3 million in bARR including: ABM Industries, a Fortune 500 company and one of the world's largest providers of facility services and solutions, is deploying authID’s biometric services for shared enterprise devices for their more than 100,000 employees.

Investor Relations Contact Ed SellittoChief Financial Officerinvestor-relations@authID.ai Non-GAAP Financial Information The Company provides certain non-GAAP financial measures in this statement. These non-GAAP key business indicators, which include Adjusted EBITDA, bARR and ARR should not be considered replacements for and should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with our results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provides useful information about our period-over-period results. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes it provides additional information with respect to the performance of our fundamental business activities and is also frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of comparable companies. We also rely on Adjusted EBITDA as a primary measure to review and assess the operating performance of our company and our management. We define Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net loss adjusted to exclude: (1) interest expense, (2) interest income, (3) provision for income taxes, (4) depreciation and amortization, (5) stock-based compensation expense (stock options) and (6) certain other items management believes affect the comparability of operating results. Other items included the following: Conversion expense of $7.5 million in 2023 and $0 in 2022Severance cost of $0.9 million in 2023 and $0.2 million in 2022Impairment loss of $0 in 2023 and $1.1 million in 2022Loss on debt extinguishment of $0.4 million in 2023 and $0 in 2022 Please see Table 1 below for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA – continuing operations to net loss – continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Table 1Reconciliation of Loss from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA continuing operations For the Year EndedDecember 31, 2023 2022 Loss from continuing operations $(19,617,969) $(23,675,310) Addback: Interest expense 1,108,458 1,359,954 Other expense (income) (98,230) 37,221 Conversion expense 7,476,000 - Loss on debt extinguishment 380,741 - Severance cost 855,279 150,000 Depreciation and amortization 255,858 749,900 Non-cash recruiting fees 438,000 - Impairment losses - 1,101,867 - Taxes 2,864 7,670 Stock compensation 487,398 8,870,168 Adjusted EBITDA continuing operations (Non-GAAP) $(8,711,601) $(11,398,530) Management believes that bARR and ARR, when viewed with our results under GAAP, provide useful information about the direction of future growth trends of the Company’s revenues. We also rely on bARR as one of a number of primary measures to review and assess the sales performance of our Company and our management team in connection with our executive compensation. The Company defines Booked Annual Recurring Revenue or bARR, as the amount of annual recurring revenue represented by the estimated amounts of annual recurring revenue we believe will be earned under such contracted orders, looking out eighteen months from the date of signing of each customer contract. The net amount of bARR reflects the deduction of the bARR of contracts previously included in reported bARR, which were subject to attrition during the quarter. The gross and net amount of bARR signed in 2023 was $2.9 million, compared to $0.23 million of bARR signed in 2022. The company defines Annual Recurring Revenue or ARR, as the amount of recurring revenue derived from sales of our Verified products during the last three months of the relevant period as determined in accordance with GAAP, multiplied by four. The amount of ARR as of December 31, 2023 was $0.20 million, compared to $0.18 million as of December 31, 2022. bARR may be distinguished from ARR, as bARR does not take specifically into account the time to implement any contract for Verified, nor for any ramp in adoption, or seasonality of usage of the Verified products but is based on the assumption that 18 months after signing these matters will have been generally resolved. Furthermore, bARR is based on estimates of future revenues under particular contracts, whereas ARR, whilst also forward looking, is based on historical revenues recognized in accordance with GAAP during the relevant period. bARR and ARR have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: bARR & ARR should not be considered as predictors of future revenues but only as indicators of the direction in which revenues may be trending. Actual revenue results in the future as determined in accordance with GAAP may be significantly different to the amounts indicated as bARR or ARR at any time.bARR and ARR are to be considered “forward looking statements” and subject to the same risks, as other such statements (see note on “Forward Looking Statements” below).bARR & ARR only include revenues from sale of our Verified and Proof products and not other revenues.bARR & ARR do not include amounts we consider as non-recurring revenues (for example one-off implementation fees).

DE C.V. and HCM Acquisition Corp Announce Closing of Business Combination Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Murano Global Investments completes business combination with HCM Acquisition Corp to trade on Nasdaq under new ticker symbol “MRNO” and “MRNOW”. The company aims to enhance its international profile, access new capital, and expand its real estate portfolio in top tourist destinations across Mexico. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The transition of Murano Global Investments to a publicly traded entity on the Nasdaq is a significant event that merits attention from investors and market observers. The listing under MRNO for common stock and MRNOW for warrants provides a new avenue for capital inflow, which can be pivotal for the company's expansion plans. The real estate sector, particularly in hospitality and commercial properties, is capital intensive and access to public markets can facilitate funding for large-scale projects and acquisitions.Moreover, the public listing enhances Murano's visibility, potentially increasing its credibility and attractiveness to international investors. The company's focus on premium locations in Mexico's tourist hotspots, like Mexico City and Cancun, taps into the growing travel and tourism industry, which is recovering post-pandemic. The expansion into public markets might also provide Murano with a more diversified shareholder base, which can lead to enhanced corporate governance and strategic oversight. Market Research Analyst Murano's strategic partnership with world-class operators and its pipeline of projects in sought-after destinations positions it well within the competitive landscape of the Mexican real estate market. The emphasis on large-scale developments aligns with the trend of destination tourism, where travelers seek comprehensive experiences. This trend is expected to grow and Murano's positioning could allow it to capitalize on this market shift.However, the success of Murano's growth strategy will depend on its ability to navigate the complexities of real estate development in Mexico, which includes regulatory hurdles and market dynamics. It's important to monitor the company's execution of its growth plans and how effectively it leverages its industry and market knowledge to maintain a competitive edge. Real Estate Investment Analyst As Murano Global Investments makes its debut on the Nasdaq, potential investors should consider the company's operational strategy and track record. The focus on premium-branded hotels and luxury resorts indicates a targeting of the high-end market segment, which can offer high margins but may also be sensitive to economic fluctuations. The company's ability to maintain occupancy rates and manage operational costs will be critical in ensuring profitability.The transferability of Murano's real estate expertise to other international markets is an ambitious aspect of its long-term growth strategy. While this presents an opportunity for scaling operations, it also poses risks associated with entering new and potentially unfamiliar territories. Investors should weigh the potential for international expansion against the challenges of adapting to different regulatory environments and consumer preferences. 03/20/2024 - 02:21 PM Murano Global Investments Ordinary Shares and Warrants to trade on Nasdaq under new ticker symbol “MRNO” and “MRNOW”LONDON, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Murano Global Investments Plc. (“Murano” or the “Company”), a London headquartered real estate company that owns, develops and invests in hotel, resort and commercial properties throughout Mexico, announces today that it has completed its business combination with HCM Acquisition Corp (NASDAQ: HCMA) (“HCM”), a special purpose acquisition company. The business combination was approved by HCMA stockholders in a special meeting held on March 5th 2024. The combined company will operate as Murano Global Investments and its common stock and warrants will begin trading on Thursday, March 21, 2024 on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbols “MRNO” and “MRNOW”, respectively. “Becoming a publicly listed company represents an important milestone for our organization as it opens up a new source of capital and significantly enhances the international profile of the Company, which will help to advance our growth plans,” said Elias Sacal, CEO of Murano. “With a portfolio that includes two premium-branded hotels located in the heart of Mexico City, an all-inclusive luxury resort in Cancun, and a pipeline of compelling projects in Cancun and Bajamar with world-class operators, we are primed to steadily expand our portfolio in top tourist destinations across Mexico. Marcos Sacal, COO of Murano, commented, “Our expertise is large-scale real estate projects, and we believe that as a publicly traded company we will have an unmatched ability to develop outstanding assets. We look forward to continuing to leverage our deep industry and market knowledge as well as our longstanding relationships to capitalize on the opportunities ahead. We also believe that the deep real estate expertise that has been developed in Mexico is transferable to other markets throughout the world.” Shawn Matthews, CEO of HCM stated, “Murano Global Investments is one of the very few entities that have the vision, experience and professional network to succeed in Mexico’s nuanced real estate development and hospitality market. It is these differentiators that initially drew us to the company, and having gotten to know the team better over the course of this process, I’m confident it will succeed in executing its growth strategy. We look forward to continuing to offer our support along the way as shareholders, advisors and friends.” As a public company, Murano Global Investments will focus on advancing its promising development projects, expanding its relationship with global hospitality brands and identifying attractive investment opportunities that align with its long-term growth strategy.

Clorox Achieves Zero Waste to Landfill in Saudi Plants,2024-03-20T17:30:00.000Z,Neutral,Very Positive,"Clorox's plants in Saudi Arabia achieve zero-waste-to-landfill status, surpassing global goals ahead of schedule. The company emphasizes the importance of recycling and waste management for environmental sustainability.","Clorox Achieves Zero Waste to Landfill in Saudi Plants Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Clorox's plants in Saudi Arabia achieve zero-waste-to-landfill status, surpassing global goals ahead of schedule. The company emphasizes the importance of recycling and waste management for environmental sustainability. Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Sustainability Expert Clorox's achievement of zero-waste-to-landfill (ZWtL) status in its Dammam and Jeddah plants is a significant environmental milestone. This move aligns with a broader corporate trend where environmental sustainability is increasingly integrated into business models. By minimizing waste, Clorox is likely reducing operational costs associated with waste disposal and potentially benefiting from the sale of recyclable materials. Moreover, this initiative may enhance the company's brand image, making its products more appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.However, one must consider the upfront investment costs for establishing the necessary waste management systems and the ongoing costs to maintain ZWtL status. While the long-term savings and environmental benefits may be substantial, the short-term financial impact could be a mix of increased expenses and savings. Investors should monitor how these initiatives affect the company's bottom line over time and whether they lead to an increase in market share among eco-aware consumers. Market Research Analyst Clorox's recent sustainability achievements could be seen as a response to consumer demand for environmentally responsible products. Market research indicates a growing segment of consumers who prioritize sustainability in their purchasing decisions. By achieving ZWtL status in its Asian and Middle Eastern plants, Clorox may be positioning itself to capture a larger share of this market. Yet, it's important to assess how these changes resonate with consumers in different regions. The emphasis on environmental conservation might have varying cultural receptions and it's important for Clorox to tailor its marketing strategies accordingly. Potential benefits include increased brand loyalty and consumer advocacy, which can translate into sales growth. However, if the sustainability narrative doesn't align with consumer expectations or if it's perceived as greenwashing, it could backfire and damage the brand's reputation. Supply Chain Management Expert Implementing ZWtL processes can have a ripple effect throughout Clorox's supply chain. By optimizing waste management, the company may also be streamlining its supply chain, leading to increased efficiency and potentially lower costs. The reutilization of materials within its operations could reduce the need for new raw materials, which is not only environmentally beneficial but may also offer a hedge against volatile commodity prices.However, the challenge lies in maintaining consistency and quality control across all facilities, especially as they expand ZWtL practices globally. The supply chain complexity increases with the scale of operations and Clorox must ensure that these environmental initiatives do not compromise product quality or lead to supply disruptions. Investors should consider the robustness of Clorox's supply chain strategy and its ability to adapt to the demands of a zero-waste initiative without compromising operational efficiency. 03/20/2024 - 01:30 PM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 20, 2024 / Our plants in Dammam and Jeddah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have joined the more than 30 Clorox facilities around the world in achieving zero-waste-to-landfill, or ZWtL, status. As we celebrate Global Recycling Day, we're reminded of the crucial role that recycling and waste management play in our overarching environmental strategy. By responsibly managing our waste streams and minimizing the amount of material sent to landfills, we're not only conserving valuable resources but also mitigating the harmful effects of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.That's why we set an ambitious goal to achieve ZWtL in 100% of our plants by 2025 and in our global facilities by 2030. These most recent achievements mean that all our plants across Asia and the Middle East have officially achieved Clorox's ZWtL criteria a full year before our deadline.Critical to our teammates' success has been their focus on upholding housekeeping and waste management processes that meet the specific needs of their operations. Like many sites before them, these teams implemented robust systems for handling waste to ensure that materials are reused or recycled onsite whenever possible.The best force-multiplier for achieving zero waste is engaging teammates with awareness campaigns that foster a sense of ownership and responsibility for environmental conservation. Through education and empowerment - including the occasional fun activity - we hope to continue inspiring our workforce to embrace sustainable practices.These latest achievements are a testament to the dedication and ingenuity of our teams to set new standards for excellence in environmental management.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from The Clorox Company on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: The Clorox CompanyWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/clorox-company Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: The Clorox CompanyView the original press release on accesswire.com What is Clorox's goal regarding zero-waste-to-landfill status for its plants?

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent underwritten public offering for C3is Inc. represents a significant capital infusion for the company, which can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, the injection of $6 million in capital will likely be directed towards the company's growth initiatives, such as expanding their product line, entering new markets, or scaling up operations. For investors, this could translate to an accelerated growth trajectory and potentially higher returns in the long run.However, it's important to note that public offerings often dilute existing shareholders' stakes. This means that while the company's value may increase, individual shares might be worth less unless the new capital leads to proportionally greater growth. Shareholders will be keenly watching the company's next moves to ensure that the capital raised is deployed effectively.Additionally, the role of Aegis Capital Corp. as the sole bookrunner indicates a level of confidence in the transaction. The success of the offering will reflect on Aegis as well, potentially affecting its reputation and ability to secure future deals. Market Research Analyst The underwritten public offering is a strategic move for C3is Inc. that could indicate the company's current market position and future outlook. An offering of this scale typically suggests that the company is in a growth phase, looking to capitalize on positive market conditions or strategic opportunities. Market analysts will be scrutinizing the company's use of proceeds statement for clues on its strategic priorities.It's also important to examine the timing of the offering.

Certified Collectibles Group to Acquire James Spence Authentication,2024-03-20T17:49:00.000Z,Neutral,Very Positive,"Certified Collectibles Group (CCG) has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire James Spence Authentication (JSA), a leader in autograph authentication.

CCG, a Blackstone portfolio company, and JSA, known for their extensive autograph database and expertise, will continue offering world-class services to collectors and dealers worldwide.","Certified Collectibles Group to Acquire James Spence Authentication Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Certified Collectibles Group (CCG) has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire James Spence Authentication (JSA), a leader in autograph authentication. The merger aims to provide seamless authentication, grading, and encapsulation services for collectors. CCG, a Blackstone portfolio company, and JSA, known for their extensive autograph database and expertise, will continue offering world-class services to collectors and dealers worldwide. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of James Spence Authentication by the Certified Collectibles Group represents a strategic consolidation within the niche market of collectible authentication and grading. This move is likely to enhance CCG's market position by broadening its service offerings to include unwitnessed autograph authentication, an area where JSA has established authority, particularly in the sports collectibles sector.From a market dynamics perspective, the merger could potentially streamline operations and provide a more integrated service experience for collectors, which may translate to increased customer loyalty and market share growth for CCG. The synergy between CCG's grading and encapsulation services and JSA's authentication expertise could create a one-stop-shop experience, potentially attracting new customers and increasing submission volumes.However, the integration of services and operations poses risks, including potential disruptions and the challenge of maintaining the high standards of authentication that JSA's customers expect. The long-term success of this acquisition will hinge on the effective management of these risks and the ability to capitalize on cross-service opportunities. Financial Analyst The transaction between CCG and JSA is indicative of CCG's growth strategy, especially following its status as a Blackstone portfolio company. The financial implications for CCG hinge on the ability to leverage JSA's autograph database and expertise to expand into new market segments and enhance its product portfolio. This could lead to revenue diversification and potentially higher profit margins due to economies of scale.Investors should monitor the post-acquisition performance closely, looking for indicators such as increased submission rates, customer retention metrics and potential entry into new markets. While the immediate financial impact may be negligible, the long-term prospects could be substantial if the combined entity can effectively monetize the expanded service offerings and leverage JSA's reputed brand in the autograph authentication space.It's also important to consider the competitive landscape. While the merger may give CCG a competitive edge, reactions from other market players could influence CCG's market position. Competitors might respond with strategic partnerships or service enhancements of their own, potentially impacting CCG's market share and growth trajectory. Collectibles Industry Expert The collectibles industry has seen a surge in popularity, with a significant uptick in trading card games, sports cards and autographed memorabilia. The acquisition of JSA by CCG could be seen as a response to the growing demand for trusted authentication services. JSA's strong reputation, particularly in sports collectibles, combined with CCG's existing grading and encapsulation services, could provide collectors with a higher level of confidence in the authenticity and quality of their items.Furthermore, the expansion of services to include a seamless submission process for a range of collectibles, from comic books to trading card games, indicates a commitment to customer convenience and could set a new industry standard. For dealers and auction houses, the association with two trusted names in the collectibles authentication space could enhance the perceived value and marketability of their offerings.However, the challenge will be to maintain the integrity and accuracy of authentication services as the volume of submissions increases. The collectibles market is highly sensitive to perceptions of authenticity and any missteps could damage the reputation of both CCG and JSA. 03/20/2024 - 01:49 PM SARASOTA, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Certified Collectibles Group® (CCG®), the leader in authenticating and grading collectibles, is excited to announce that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire James Spence Authentication® (JSA®), the leader in autograph authentication. The combination of CCG and JSA will provide collectors and dealers with a seamless solution to have autographed collectibles authenticated, graded and encapsulated by the world’s top experts. The mission of CCG is to empower collectors with services that ignite passion, create value and build community. Since 1987, its iconic brands — NGC®, PMG®, CGC® and ASG® — have certified more than 90 million coins, banknotes, comic books, magazines, trading card games, sports cards, video games, home video, stamps and related collectibles. In 2021, CCG became a Blackstone portfolio company (NYSE: BX). JSA was founded in 2005 by James Spence, Jr., a giant in the world of autograph and memorabilia collecting. In the last two decades, JSA has certified millions of autographs and in the process has built the world’s largest autograph database of nearly 1 million images encompassing virtually every known person — from Thomas Jefferson to Taylor Swift, Lou Gehrig to Little League stars. JSA uses this extraordinary database alongside deep expertise and state-of-the-art equipment to maintain unparalleled accuracy in autograph authentication. In addition, JSA’s experts frequent shows and interact closely with collectors, dealers and auction houses, further defining the JSA name as being synonymous with trust and accessibility. James J. Spence, Jr. and James J. Spence III will remain at JSA’s helm after the transaction closes, and Mark Pepitone, a JSA co-owner and an industry expert in his own right, will serve as Senior Advisor to the company. The Spences, the JSA brand and their expert team will continue to provide the same world-class authentication services for autographs, with CCG enabling JSA to offer expanded services to collectors and dealers, such as grading and encapsulation, and to better serve collectors worldwide. “CCG and JSA are the perfect match, with a shared passion for collectibles along with an unwavering commitment to expertise and integrity,” said Steven R. Eichenbaum, CEO of the Certified Collectibles Group. “I could not be more pleased with the addition of JSA and the Spences to the CCG family, and I think collectors will love the simplicity and scope of our combined services.” The acquisition of JSA is CCG’s answer to the countless collectors and dealers who have asked to have their autographed collectibles authenticated and then graded and encapsulated. Although CCG pioneered witnessed authentication of autographs through its popular CGC Signature Series service, it has never offered full authentication and grading services for collectibles with unwitnessed autographs. JSA has a particularly strong reputation in sports collectibles, a market that is an important focus for CCG. With JSA, CCG will significantly upgrade its services for collectors of sports, autographs and memorabilia through additional expertise, increased show attendance and other efforts. In April, collectors of autographed comic books, magazines, sports cards, trading card games (TCGs) and non-sports cards will benefit from a seamless submission experience where they can use a single online form to submit their collectibles for JSA autograph authentication and CGC grading and encapsulation. More services and enhancements will be announced in the months ahead. “This is the ideal next chapter in JSA’s history. CCG’s mission and vision are aligned with our own, and we are excited to see what the company’s extensive experience and resources can do for autograph authentication and collecting,” shared James J. Spence, Jr. and Mark Pepitone. “This combination is a true testament to the outstanding work of the entire JSA team, whose efforts have made JSA the world’s most trusted name in autograph authentication,” they added. JSA and CCG will operate independently for another few weeks while the companies work behind-the-scenes to integrate. Instructions on how to submit autographed comics, magazines and cards will be posted on the companies’ websites (CGCcomics.com and CGCcards.com) soon. © 2024 Certified Collectibles Group.

NLS Pharmaceutics Announces $1.75 Million Registered Direct Offering,2024-03-20T17:40:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"NLS Pharmaceutics  announces a registered direct offering of 7,000,000 common shares at $0.25 per share, along with a private placement of unregistered warrants to purchase up to 3,500,000 common shares.","NLS Pharmaceutics Announces $1.75 Million Registered Direct Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary NLS Pharmaceutics announces a registered direct offering of 7,000,000 common shares at $0.25 per share, along with a private placement of unregistered warrants to purchase up to 3,500,000 common shares. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent move by NLS Pharmaceutics to issue 7 million common shares at a price of $0.25 each, along with warrants for an additional 3.5 million shares, represents a capital raising strategy. The capital infusion is likely aimed at funding ongoing research and development projects or to shore up the company's balance sheet. Such offerings can dilute existing shareholders but may be necessary for the company's growth.Investors should note the share price at which the new equity is issued. A discount to the current market price could indicate the company's urgent need for cash or a lack of negotiating power. The warrant exercise price being set at the same level as the share price in the direct offering suggests a confidence in maintaining the stock's value at or above the offering price.Long-term implications include the potential for increased liquidity and future growth fueled by the capital raised. However, shareholders should be aware of the immediate dilutive effect and the possibility of downward pressure on the stock price in the short term. Biotech Market Analyst NLS Pharmaceutics operates in the high-stakes biopharmaceutical sector, where the development of treatments for central nervous system disorders can be a lengthy and expensive process. The direct offering indicates that NLS is likely at a critical juncture in its development pipeline, necessitating substantial capital.The biotech industry often sees companies with no product revenue stream relying on capital markets to fund their operations. The success of such companies is highly dependent on their ability to reach clinical milestones that validate their research and potentially lead to profitable partnerships or acquisitions.For stakeholders, the key will be monitoring the deployment of these funds towards clinical trials or other research initiatives that could lead to value-creating events. The issuance of warrants is also a strategic move, as it could potentially bring in additional capital if the stock performs well, but it also adds to future dilution risk. Pharmaceutical Legal Expert The structure of the offering, involving both registered direct offerings and private placement of unregistered warrants, is a common fundraising approach in the pharmaceutical industry. It is designed to balance immediate funding needs with the opportunity to raise additional capital in the future.From a legal standpoint, the offering's compliance with securities regulations is crucial, as is the transparency of the terms to investors. The exercise of the warrants will be subject to market conditions and regulatory considerations, which can impact the company's financials and operational strategy.The legal frameworks governing such transactions are designed to protect both the company and its investors. Investors should be aware of their rights regarding the warrants, including the exercisability and expiration terms. The five-year expiration on the warrants is a standard term, giving investors a relatively long window to decide on exercising them based on the company's performance and market conditions. 03/20/2024 - 01:40 PM ZURICH, SWITZERLAND / ACCESSWIRE / March 20, 2024 / NLS Pharmaceutics Ltd.

NLS has also agreed to issue in a private placement unregistered warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,500,000 common shares at an exercise price of $0.25 per share. The warrants will become immediately exercisable upon issuance and will expire five years from the date of issuance. The closing of the offering is expected to occur on or about March 22, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.H.C.

Positive Ancora Holdings Group raises concerns about Norfolk Southern 's decision to appoint a new COO at a significant cost. The appointment of a third COO in two years under CEO Alan Shaw is questioned by Ancora Holdings Group for potentially prioritizing personal interests over shareholder interests. Norfolk Southern 's agreement to pay $25 million and concede part of its long-term franchise for the new COO, who lacks experience at an Eastern railroad, is criticized by Ancora Holdings Group. Ancora Holdings Group highlights that Norfolk Southern invested approximately $300 million for a 30% stake in Meridian assets in 2006, suggesting a higher net present value in 2024. The deal between Norfolk Southern and CPKC raises concerns as it allows CPKC to leverage concessions for greater value from its transaction with CSX involving the Meridian & Bigbee Railroad. Ancora Holdings Group questions the decision-making process at Norfolk Southern , indicating potential risks to shareholder value. Negative The appointment of a new COO could lead to internal restructuring and potential disruptions within Norfolk Southern The $25 million payment and franchise concessions may impact Norfolk Southern 's financial performance in the short term. The lack of experience of the new COO at an Eastern railroad raises concerns about operational efficiency and strategic decision-making at Norfolk Southern 03/20/2024 - 01:48 PM CLEVELAND--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ohio-based Ancora Holdings Group, LLC (collectively with its affiliates, “Ancora” or “we”), which owns a large equity stake in Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) (“Norfolk Southern” or the “Company”), today issued the below statement in response to the Company’s appointment of its third COO in two years under CEO Alan Shaw: “The Board and Mr. Shaw put their own interests ahead of shareholders’ interests by paying $25 million and giving up part of Norfolk Southern’s long-term franchise, in the form of concessions related to the Meridian Speedway and Terminal, just to hire a COO without any experience at an Eastern railroad and whose most recent role was eliminated altogether at CPKC.1 Keep in mind that Norfolk Southern invested approximately $300 million for a 30% stake in the Meridian assets in 2006, suggesting the net present value of that stake is worth significantly more in 2024. The deal disclosed today allows Norfolk Southern to hire one questionable executive while permitting CPKC to leverage concessions to realize greater value from its transaction involving the Meridian & Bigbee Railroad, which it is pursuing with CSX.2 The deal also proceeded despite Norfolk Southern’s previous concerns about CPKC and CSX’s partnership plans.3 It appears the Board and Mr. Shaw struck a fool’s bargain that gets Norfolk Southern a short-term PR win while CPKC and CSX, the Company’s closest peer, strengthen their partnership and competitive offerings. Based on the real and implied cost of securing Mr. Orr, who analysts and investors have told us they never heard of prior to today, the sitting directors may have signed off on one of the most expensive and overpriced hires in industry history. Norfolk Southern’s leadership took this costly and defensive step amidst an election contest, absent a comprehensive search and interview process, and without providing shareholders any say in the decision.4 We believe this action does not just deprive shareholders of the best possible COO and strengthen two other Class I railroads, but it puts in place an individual with limited experience as an operations leader and little involvement in any recent PSR implementation. The fact is Mr. Orr was appointed EVP of Operations at Kansas City Southern after it had already announced its merger with Canadian Pacific in March 2021 and well after Sameh Fahmy, our director candidate, oversaw a multi-year network transformation as EVP of PSR at Kansas City Southern. It is important to note that the Board not only rejected the opportunity to speak with our proposed COO, who has received extremely positive feedback from shareholders, but it never even offered to have a substantive discussion with us about freeing him up from expiring employment obligations. It speaks volumes about the Board and Mr. Shaw’s motives that they would not even have an introductory call with a seemingly superior operator, who was the EVP of Operations at CSX when it outperformed Norfolk Southern on every key railroading metric (despite the wildly misleading claims in the Company’s March 20th letter). They made this conscious decision, which entailed an excessive cash payment and commercial concessions, despite fully knowing that our candidate is getting strong praise from the investment community, suggesting a disregard for shareholders’ feedback and interests. This decision was also made after the Board became aware of publicly filed legal actions involving Mr. Orr. Based on Norfolk Southern’s repeated acts of desperation and factually inaccurate attacks on our people, it seems the Board and Mr. Shaw will do and say anything to try to stay in place. However, the appointment of Mr. Orr and the publication of seemingly fanciful financial and operational targets do not represent a ‘reset’ for Norfolk Southern’s reeling leadership – to the contrary, what has come out today only reinforces the need for sweeping leadership changes atop the Company. Norfolk Southern needs a Board that puts shareholders’ interests ahead of insiders’ interests.” To recap: Norfolk Southern has paid $25 million and given away a key element of its franchise to hire Mr. Orr, resulting in what we consider to be an ill-conceived deal that benefits competitors and harms shareholders. Mr. Orr, who was hastily hired without a broad search and lacks Eastern railroad experience, does not appear to be the best available executive to implement PSR principles and help transform Norfolk Southern’s network. Much to our disappointment, the Board refused to even speak with our proposed COO, Jamie Boychuk, who oversaw best-in-class operating metrics and network efficiencies at CSX. Rather than putting the best people in place to drive shareholder value, the Board seems to be making costly deals and poor decisions at the expense of shareholders in order to insulate CEO Alan Shaw and incumbent directors. Mr. Orr’s hire does not change our view that the Company continues to have the wrong CEO in Mr. Shaw and the wrong strategy in the form of “resilience” railroading. *** About Ancora Founded in 2003, Ancora Holdings Group, LLC offers integrated investment advisory, wealth management, retirement plan services and insurance solutions to individuals and institutions across the United States.

The financial data is consolidated and includes Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri A.S. and its subsidiaries. The press release provides a breakdown of reporting segments and key indicators for the year. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The disclosure of Turkcell's financial performance, particularly the achievement of double-digit real growth and the exceeding of guidance, is a significant indicator of the company's operational efficiency and market positioning. An evaluation of the financial results prepared under IFRS and TAS/TFRS suggests a robust accounting framework, ensuring transparency for investors. The segmentation of reporting into 'Turkcell Türkiye' and 'Turkcell International,' along with 'Techfin' and 'Other' categories, allows for a granular analysis of revenue streams and potential areas for capital allocation.Investors may find the classification of certain operations in Ukraine as discontinued particularly noteworthy, as this reflects strategic shifts and potential future divestments. The financial impact of discontinued operations must be assessed, considering both the immediate financial implications and the longer-term strategic realignment. Moreover, the adherence to IAS 29 is critical in the context of hyperinflationary economies, which can significantly distort financial outcomes. This adherence indicates a proactive approach to financial reporting, providing stakeholders with a realistic view of financial health. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Turkcell's performance in the telecom sector within Türkiye and its digital services operations abroad suggests a competitive edge in both domestic and international markets. The year-on-year comparison of key indicators serves as a benchmark for operational success and can influence investor sentiment. The strategic significance of the Techfin segment points to diversification efforts and the potential tapping into new revenue sources in financial services, a move that could resonate well with investors seeking growth in fintech.The operational and financial data provided, particularly in a year-end report, is a critical tool for forecasting future market trends and understanding the company's trajectory. The mention of double-digit growth is likely to be received positively by the market, signaling strong performance and possibly affecting Turkcell's stock valuation. However, the impact of macroeconomic factors, such as currency fluctuations and inflation, must be monitored as they can affect the purchasing power parity and, consequently, the real growth figures. Telecommunications Industry Expert The telecom industry is highly susceptible to technological advancements and regulatory changes. Turkcell's reported growth and segmentation indicate an adaptive business model that is responsive to the dynamic nature of the telecom sector. The focus on digital services and business services within Türkiye reflects an understanding of the evolving consumer demands and the shift towards digital transformation. Additionally, the international component of Turkcell's operations, particularly in the context of discontinued operations, suggests strategic repositioning which could streamline the company's focus and optimize resource allocation.Understanding the implications of IAS29 in Turkcell's financial reporting is important for stakeholders, as it adjusts the financial statements to reflect the economic reality in hyperinflationary conditions. This level of detail in financial reporting is commendable and provides a clearer picture of the company's financial health. Stakeholders should interpret these results with an understanding of the broader industry trends, such as the increasing demand for digital services and the competitive landscape of the telecom industry. 03/20/2024 - 12:51 PM Achieving Double-digit Real Growth; Guidance Exceeded ISTANBUL--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri A.S.

COMMENTS BY CEO, ALİ TAHA KOÇ, PhD 2023 was a year in which Türkiye's agenda was shaped by the February earthquake that came to be known as the disaster of the century, the general election period, and challenging macroeconomic conditions. Globally, the main impacts came from decelerated growth due to central banks' continued tightening policies, ongoing wars creating humanitarian crises, and the effects of climate change. Despite these challenges, I am proud to share with you our determination to further strengthen Türkiye's pioneering position on the journey of digital transformation. During this time, we continued to enhance our technological infrastructure, know-how, and capabilities to provide our customers with a seamless and high-quality communication experience. We aim to develop new strategies to increase Türkiye's digital access and make technology more inclusive. With our projects supporting digital transformation in various fields, from education and healthcare to business and social life, as Türkiye's Turkcell, we continue to invest in the development of the technology sector and the future of our country. Yet another year highlighted by prominent achievements… We completed the year 2023 with a performance that exceeded our expectations. In 2023, according to inflation accounting practices*, our consolidated revenues rose 14.6% to TRY107.1 billion, thanks to the expanding subscriber base, sequential price adjustments, and contributions from our techfin business and digital services. Consolidated EBITDA1 rose by 19.9% to TRY43.9 billion, with an EBITDA margin of 41.0%. Meanwhile, net income increased by 82.5% year-on-year to TRY12.6 billion. In 2023, while maintaining our leadership in the mobile segment, we remain committed to our rational pricing strategy, despite the aggressive short-term campaigns of our competitors. This approach enabled us to maintain our dynamic position in the industry. Moreover, thanks to our customer-oriented strategy, innovative and comprehensive offerings, large sales network strengthened by digital channels, and best-in-class infrastructure, we had 799 thousand net subscriber additions. This year, we maintained our focus on postpaid subscribers, ensuring a higher revenue growth contribution, and gained a net 1.6 million subscribers. On the fixed broadband side, while focusing on penetration with our fiber product, we also remained focused on revenue growth. By extending our end-to-end fiber service to an additional 386 thousand home passes in 2023, the total number of households reached rose to 5.8 million. Our fiber subscribers reached 2.3 million. Our strategic focus areas continue to support growth We continued our digital service portfolio activities, comprising significant brands such as BiP, TV+, lifebox, fizy, GAME+, and digital advertising. In 2023, the number of stand-alone paid users2 enjoying our digital services increased by 9% year-on-year to 5.6 million. In 2023, Digital Business Services remained the primary supporter of corporate customers on their digital transformation journey. In addition to end-to-end tailored digitalization services, data centers and cloud services were the key contributors to revenue growth. We have completed over 3,500 projects in system integration and managed services to date; the backlog from system integration projects has reached TRY3.1 billion. In the digital data era, we consider the ownership of data, the raw material of industrial transformation, remaining in our country to be an important initiative. To keep Türkiye's data within the country, we are committed to retaining our leadership position in the data center market. We intend to further bolster our investments, having already allocated EUR330 million since inception. Our techfin services, Financell3 and Paycell, continued their operations successfully in 2023. Financell, continuing to diversify its product portfolio according to the financing needs of individual and corporate customers, had reached a credit portfolio of TRY6.2 billion by the end of 2023. Paycell, with its extensive product portfolio that provides fast and secure payment solutions, had reached 8.0 million users by the end of 2023. While the ""Pay Later"" service, which constitutes a significant portion of Paycell's revenues, remains the key vertical driving growth, POS solutions, which have been rapidly expanding since the last quarter of the previous year, have also supported Paycell's growth. We are shaping the future with our sustainability vision As per our sustainability strategy, we aim to positively impact our environment, society, business, and planet in all our endeavors. Therefore, as a leading company in the technology and telecommunications sector, we integrate sustainability into our business strategy and operations. In this context, we don't just consider our investment in renewable energy an environmentally friendly step but also an essential element in managing our energy needs. In addition to our wind energy power plant, our solar energy plant projects, which will have an installed capacity of 300 MW, along with greenfield and rooftop solar power installations, we are confidently moving towards a future where we expect to meet 65% of our energy needs from our renewable energy sources in 2026. This brings us one step closer to our goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. These investments enhance our environmental sustainability while making our business model more competitive and sustainable. In addition to these efforts, as Turkcell, we greatly emphasize social investment projects to ensure equal opportunities for all segments of our society, utilizing the inclusive power of digitalization. We carry out projects that prioritize social benefit, promote digital literacy, raise awareness about the conscious use of technology, and enable participation in various aspects of life for many groups, from children to young people and from the elderly to individuals with disabilities. While supporting environmental sustainability with our renewable energy investments, we aim to add value to all institutions and businesses through digital transformation. This dual approach brings us closer to our goal of becoming a net-zero company and strengthens the social integration and inclusivity of technology. In the coming periods, through the steps we will take towards environmental and social sustainability, we believe that as Turkcell, the leading telecommunication and technology company, we will shape Türkiye's Digital Century. Turkcell means Technology Meanwhile, our approach to artificial intelligence technologies strikes a delicate balance between fostering innovation and prioritizing societal benefit. We are fully confident that, in line with this strategy, we will play a critical role in shaping the future. As Turkcell, we effectively integrate artificial intelligence solutions into every aspect of our operations while ensuring the ethical use of AI in our actions. The chatbot that we have developed, supporting around 200 thousand customers per day, provides a tangible example of how these technologies can be implemented in business models. Additionally, we have AI-supported recommendation systems on our fizy and TV+ platforms, enhancing our capacity to provide content tailored to users' preferences. Furthermore, Turkcell's artificial intelligence team has played a significant role in developing the 'In-Car Face Detection, Recognition, and Analysis System' for Turkiye's domestic pride, Togg, the Turkish EV. These projects epitomize how technology transforms our business processes and contributes to social benefit. We aim to elevate Turkcell's strongest and most significant capability, the best-in-class mobile and fixed network infrastructure, to the next level, focusing on increasing FTTS (Fiber to the Site) and modernizing through GPON (Gigabit Passive Optical Network) in the upcoming period. We continue to take determined steps towards being the best in the technologies of 5G and beyond. In this context, alongside our network preparations, we are increasing R&D collaboration with our business partners. In 2024, we expect4 high-single-digit growth in Group revenues, an EBITDA margin of around 42%, and the operational capex over sales ratio5 of around 23%. In the upcoming periods, our determination to carry Turkcell and our country to a brighter future with a focus on innovation and our spirit of excellence will continue uninterrupted, positioning Turkcell as the pioneer of Türkiye's Digital Century. I express my gratitude to our Board of Directors, colleagues, customers, and shareholders who have been by my side throughout this successful journey. Together, I am fully confident that we will achieve further success. (1) EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.

(2) EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See page 16 for the explanation of how we calculate Adjusted EBITDA and its reconciliation to net income. (3) EBIT is a non-GAAP financial measure and is equal to EBITDA minus depreciation and amortization expenses. Revenue of the Group grew by 14.6% year-on-year in FY23. This growth is attributable to the expanding customer base of Turkcell Türkiye driven by the postpaid subscriber base, and price adjustments. Additionally, revenue growth was supported by our techfin business and digital services. For the full year, Turkcell Türkiye revenues, comprising 86% of Group revenues, grew 18.0% to TRY91,953 million (TRY77,952 million). - Consumer business rose4 18.7% driven mainly by subscriber net additions both in mobile and fixed segments, price adjustments and upsell efforts. - Corporate revenues4 rose 20.3% mainly supported by digital business services revenue growth of 23.0%. - Standalone digital services revenues from consumer and corporate segments grew 19.4% driven mainly by an expanding standalone paid user base. (4) Following the change in the organizational structure, the revenues from sole proprietorship subscribers that we define as Merchant, which were previously managed under the Corporate segment, are being reported under the Consumer segment as of and from the third quarter of 2023. Within this scope, past data has been revised for comparative purposes. - Wholesale revenues grew 3.3% to TRY6,475 million (TRY6,269 million). Turkcell International revenues (excl. Ukraine operations), comprising 2% of Group revenues decreased by 1.8% to TRY2,626 million (TRY2,673 million). Techfin segment revenues, comprising 4% of Group revenues, increased by 28.9% to TRY4,569 million (TRY3,545 million). This was driven by a 28.6% rise in Paycell revenues and 27.7% growth in Financell revenues. Please refer to the Techfin section for details. Other subsidiaries’ revenues, at 7% of Group revenues, including mainly consumer electronics sales revenues, and non-group energy business revenues decreased by 14.5% to TRY7,969 million (TRY9,317 million). Cost of revenue (excluding depreciation and amortization) decreased to 49.6% (52.5%) as a percentage of revenues for the full year of 2023. This was driven mainly by the decline in interconnection cost (1.9pp), energy cost (1.5pp), and cost of goods sold (1.5pp), despite the increase in personnel expenses (1.5pp), and other cost items (0.5pp) as a percentage of revenues for the full year. Administrative expenses increased to 3.2% (2.8%) as a percentage of revenues for the full year. This was mainly due to increased personnel expenses. Selling and marketing expenses increased to 5.3% (4.9%) as a percentage of revenues in FY23. This was driven by the increase in personnel expenses (0.7pp), despite the decline in marketing expenses (0.1pp) and other expenses (0.2pp) as a percentage of revenues in FY23. Net impairment losses on financial and contract assets was at 0.9% (0.7%) as a percentage of revenues in FY23. EBITDA1 rose by 19.9% year-on-year in FY23 leading to an EBITDA margin of 41.0% with a 1.8pp improvement (39.2%). - Turkcell Türkiye’s EBITDA rose 24.1% to TRY40,663 million (TRY32,771 million) leading to an EBITDA margin of 44.2% (42.0%). - Turkcell International (excl. Ukraine operations) EBITDA increased 9.2% to TRY973 million (TRY891 million) driving an EBITDA margin of 37.1% (33.3%) on 3.8pp improvement. - Techfin segment EBITDA declined by 8.1% to TRY1,608 million (TRY1,750 million) with an EBITDA margin of 35.2% (49.3%). The key factor behind the year-on-year decline in EBITDA margin was the rise in funding cost for Financell compared to the previous year. - The EBITDA of other subsidiaries declined by 47% to TRY633 million for the full year (TRY1,196 million). Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by 4.0% year-on-year for the full year. Net finance costs increased to TRY3,451 million (TRY224 million) in FY23. This was driven mainly by higher FX losses which were partially offset by derivative gains, and the fair value gains registered on currency-protected time deposits. Additionally, higher interest expenses limited the positive impact. See Appendix A for details of net foreign exchange gain and loss. Other expenses increased to TRY4,766 million (TRY1,058 million) for the full year mainly due to donation and litigation expenses. See Appendix A for details of net foreign exchange gain and loss. Income tax expense: The income tax expense of TRY4,676 million (TRY2,785 million) was reported, mainly due to an increase in deferred income tax expense triggered by the implementation of inflationary accounting in statutory accounts. Net income of the Group increased by 82.5% to TRY12.6 billion (TRY6.9 billion) in FY23. This resulted mainly from strong performance at the revenue and EBITDA levels and the positive impact of deferred income tax expense. (1) EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See page 16 for the explanation of how we calculate adjusted EBITDA and its reconciliation to net income. Total cash & debt: Consolidated cash as of December 31, 2023, increased to TRY49,979 million compared to TRY42,776 million as of December 31, 2022. This was driven mainly by the positive impact of currency movements. Excluding FX swap transactions, 53% of our cash is in US$, 20% in EUR, 2% CNY, and 25% in TRY. Consolidated debt as of December 31, 2023, decreased to TRY84,084 million from TRY88,737 million as of December 31, 2022 due mainly to the impact of currency movements. Please note that TRY2,428 million of our consolidated debt is comprised of lease obligations. Please note that 45% of our consolidated debt is in US$, 32% in EUR, 3% in CNY, 1% in BYN, and 20% in TRY. Net debt1 as of December 31, 2023, was at TRY23,803 million with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.5x times. Turkcell Group had a long FX position of US$22 million at the end of the year (Please note that this figure takes hedging portfolio and advance payments into account). The long FX position of US$22 million is in line with our FX neutral definition, which is between -US$200 million and +US$200 million. Capital expenditures: Capital expenditures, including non-operational items were at TRY33,950 million in FY23. For the full year, operational capital expenditures (excluding license fees) at the Group level were at 20.0% of total revenues. Capital expenditures (million TRY) Year FY222 FY233 Operational Capex 19,533.1 21,430.3 License and Related Costs 536.8 3,632.9 Non-operational Capex (Including IFRS15 & IFRS16) 9,815.8 8,886.9 Total Capex 29,885.6 33,950.0 (1) Starting from Q421, we have revised the definition of our net debt calculation to include ""financial assets” reported under current and non-current assets. Required reserves held in CBRT balances are also considered in net debt calculation. We believe that these assets are highly liquid and can be easily converted to cash without significant change in value.

(3) Churn figures represent average monthly churn figures for the respective years. Turkcell Türkiye subscriber base grew by 799 thousand net additions in FY23 to 42.5 million. In addition, we have achieved 5.8 million net subscriber additions in the last 3 years thanks to our wide range of solutions tailored to customer preferences, our pioneering campaigns designed to simplify their lives, our superior infrastructure, a unique customer experience and our analytical capabilities. On the mobile front, our subscriber base expanded to 38.0 million on 493 thousand net annual additions in FY23. This was driven by 1.6 million net additions from the postpaid subscriber base, which reached 71.5% (68.1%) of total mobile subscribers. We had 476 thousand quarterly postpaid subscriber net additions in Q423. We experienced a net decline of 708 thousand in our prepaid subscriber base quarter-on-quarter, primarily attributed to the disconnection of 297 thousand inactive prepaid accounts over the quarter, as per our customer churn policy. On the fixed front, we saw a net increase of 169 thousand fiber subscribers in FY23, attributable to our investments in fiber networks, and the robust demand for high-speed, and quality broadband services. Total fixed subscribers reached 3.1 million on 38 thousand quarterly and 173 thousand annual net additions. Meanwhile, IPTV customers exceeded 1.4 million on 34 thousand quarterly and 127 thousand annual net additions. The average yearly mobile churn rate was at 2.0% and the fixed churn rate at 1.5% in FY23, both parallel to the long-term healthy level of 2%. On an inflation adjusted basis, our mobile ARPU (excluding M2M) rose 18.4% year-on-year in FY23 driven mainly by price adjustments to reflect inflationary impacts and upsell to higher tariffs, as well as a larger postpaid subscriber base. Meanwhile, our residential fiber ARPU remained almost the same year-on-year in FY23. Average monthly mobile data usage per user rose 15.6% year-on-year to 17.0 GB, with the increasing number and data consumption of 4.5G users in FY23. Accordingly, the average mobile data usage of 4.5G users reached 18.2 GB in FY23. Total smartphone penetration on our network reached 90% in Q423. 94% of those smartphones were 4.5G compatible.

It also facilitates performance comparisons from company to company. Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure eliminates potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact of changes in effective tax rates on periods or companies) and the age and book depreciation of tangible assets (affecting relative depreciation expense). We also present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating the performance of other mobile operators in the telecommunications industry in Europe, many of which present Adjusted EBITDA when reporting their results. Our Adjusted EBITDA definition includes Revenue, Cost of Revenue excluding depreciation and amortization, Selling and Marketing expenses, Administrative expenses and Net impairment losses on financial and contract assets, but excludes finance income and expense, other operating income and expense, investment activity income and expense, share of profit of equity accounted investees and minority interest. Nevertheless, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation from, or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations, as reported under IFRS. The following table provides a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated using financial data prepared in accordance with IFRS to net profit, which we believe is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS.

Management believes this measure is helpful in assessing the development of our services over time.

Synopsys Expands Semiconductor IP Portfolio With Acquisition of Intrinsic ID,2024-03-20T16:15:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Synopsys, Inc. (SNPS) has acquired Intrinsic ID, a leading provider of PUF IP, to enhance its semiconductor IP portfolio. The acquisition brings unique identifier generation capabilities to SoC designers worldwide, bolstering Synopsys' position in the smart and connected devices market.","Synopsys Expands Semiconductor IP Portfolio With Acquisition of Intrinsic ID Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Synopsys, Inc. (SNPS) has acquired Intrinsic ID, a leading provider of PUF IP, to enhance its semiconductor IP portfolio. The acquisition brings unique identifier generation capabilities to SoC designers worldwide, bolstering Synopsys' position in the smart and connected devices market. Positive None. Negative None. Cybersecurity Expert The acquisition of Intrinsic ID by Synopsys represents a strategic move to enhance the cybersecurity features within their semiconductor IP offerings. With the integration of Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) technology, Synopsys can now provide a more robust security framework for system-on-chips (SoCs). PUFs leverage the unique physical characteristics of silicon to create a secure and tamper-proof identity for each chip, which is critical in preventing counterfeiting and unauthorized device replication.From a cybersecurity perspective, this acquisition could potentially lead to a new standard in SoC security, particularly for applications requiring high levels of trust such as in the defense, finance and healthcare sectors. The added expertise from Intrinsic ID's R&D team could accelerate innovation in this field, which may in turn create a competitive advantage for Synopsys in the semiconductor market. Technology Market Analyst Examining the market implications, Synopsys's acquisition of Intrinsic ID is not expected to have a material impact on their financials, suggesting that the deal size is relatively small compared to Synopsys's overall business. However, the strategic value lies in the potential market differentiation this technology can offer. As IoT and connected devices proliferate, the demand for secure SoCs is likely to grow and with this acquisition, Synopsys is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.The mention of establishing a center of excellence for PUF technology in Eindhoven is noteworthy. It indicates a long-term commitment to advancing this technology, which could foster innovation and potentially lead to the development of new IP products. This could have downstream effects on the stock market as investors look for companies with a strong foothold in emerging tech sectors. Semiconductor Industry Analyst The acquisition's impact on the semiconductor industry could be significant, considering the increasing importance of hardware-based security solutions. PUF technology is relatively niche but growing in importance as a means to secure hardware at the foundational level. This move by Synopsys may prompt other industry players to consider similar acquisitions or partnerships to bolster their security offerings.Furthermore, the establishment of a research hub in the Netherlands aligns with the global trend of semiconductor companies investing in R&D to stay ahead of technological advancements. This could have implications for the regional semiconductor landscape and may influence talent acquisition and industry partnerships in the region. 03/20/2024 - 12:15 PM SUNNYVALE, Calif., March 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Synopsys, Inc.

The acquisition also adds Intrinsic ID's team of experienced research and development engineers who have deep expertise in PUF technology. The terms of the deal, which are not material to Synopsys financials, are not being disclosed.

This expansion will provide residents with fast, reliable internet services, including the Internet Essentials program for low-income households. Positive None. Negative None. Telecommunications Industry Analyst The approval by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities for Comcast to extend its Xfinity network in Edison Township is a strategic move that can potentially alter the competitive landscape within the telecommunications sector in the region. This expansion will introduce a significant increase in serviceable addresses, which translates into a direct opportunity for revenue growth for Comcast. The deployment of a fiber-rich network is indicative of the company's commitment to providing high-speed internet, which is a critical service in today's digital economy.From an industry perspective, this move is aligned with the broader trend of infrastructure enhancement by major telecom players seeking to capitalize on the growing demand for reliable and fast internet services. The introduction of such services in underserved areas can stimulate local economies by enhancing connectivity for businesses and improving online access for education and remote work. However, the long-term success of this initiative will depend on the company's ability to maintain service quality and customer satisfaction amidst the increased operational footprint. Market Research Analyst The decision to expand Comcast's network to over 40,000 homes and businesses can be seen as a response to the increasing need for broadband services that cater to remote work and digital learning environments. This expansion is likely to be well-received by the local market, as it promises enhanced connectivity options. Market penetration in Edison Township could serve as a case study for Comcast's future expansions in similar markets.It's important to monitor consumer response post-implementation, as this will provide valuable insights into the success of Comcast's business strategy. The company's investment in local infrastructure could also serve as a catalyst for competitors to enhance their own services, potentially leading to a more dynamic market. The impact on Comcast's market share and customer base in New Jersey will be a key metric to watch in the coming years. Financial Analyst The financial implications of Comcast's expansion into Edison Township are multifaceted. Initially, the capital expenditure required for the construction of the network will impact the company's cash flow. However, the long-term revenue potential from new subscribers can offset these costs and contribute to the company's profitability. It is important to evaluate the cost-per-acquisition of new customers in this expansion and compare it to industry benchmarks to assess the financial viability of such projects.Investors should consider the potential for increased revenue streams from Comcast's suite of services, including the Internet Essentials program targeting income-constrained households. The diversification of the customer base and the potential for cross-selling additional services could enhance the average revenue per user (ARPU). The strategic expansion in New Jersey, combined with Comcast's existing market presence, could lead to economies of scale and operational efficiencies in the long run. 03/20/2024 - 01:20 PM New Jersey Board of Public Utilities Approves Application to Extend the Xfinity Network to More Than 40,000 Homes and Businesses TREVOSE, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities has approved Comcast’s application for a system-wide franchise to operate in Edison Township, NJ.

The company maintains profitability while leading in energy transition investments. Positive None. Negative None. 03/20/2024 - 11:13 AM PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News: TotalEnergies (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE) publishes its Sustainability & Climate – 2024 Progress Report, as pledged by the Board of Directors since 2020. This report gives an account of the implementation the Company's strategy and the progress made in 2023 with regard to the objectives for 2030, notably its achievements in terms of emissions reductions and its contribution to a just, orderly and equitable energy transition for all its stakeholders. TotalEnergies thus reaffirms the relevance of its balanced multi-energy strategy combining profitable growth and sustainable development, anchored on two pillars: oil & gas, notably LNG, and electricity, notably renewable, the energy at the heart of the transition. In 2023, like in 2022, TotalEnergies was the most profitable major, with a return on capital employed of 19%, while also being the major that invests the most in the energy transition. In Oil & Gas, thanks to having refocused its portfolio on assets and projects with low breakeven and low greenhouse gas emissions, TotalEnergies intends to produce oil & gas in a responsible manner, as illustrated by its 2023 achievements in emissions reductions: 34% reduction in Scope 1+2 emissions from operated oil & gas facilities compared to 2015, decrease, to 18 kg CO2e/boe, of the Scope 1+2 emission intensity of upstream oil & gas activities on an equity basis, 47% reduction in methane emissions on operated facilities in 2023 vs 2020, already among the lowest in the peer group. In order to concretely transcribe its ambition to aim for zero methane emissions, TotalEnergies extends its objective to reduce its methane intensity to <0.1% by 2030 to the entirety of its operated upstream oil & gas facilities – not just its gas facilities. In gas, energy of the transition which complements the intermittency of renewable energies in electricity generation and represents a virtuous alternative for countries burning coal for their power generation needs, the Company estimates that its LNG sales contributed to avoiding about 70 Mt of CO2e emissions worldwide in 2023. In electricity, TotalEnergies invested more than $5 billion in 2023 in low-carbon energies, essentially in electricity, contributing to building a profitable and differentiated Integrated Power business, which will both become a cash engine for the Company and reduce the emissions resulting from the use of energy products sold to its clients: the lifecycle carbon intensity of energy products sold by TotalEnergies to its customers for final use was 13% lower in 2023 compared to 2015, and is on track to meet the objective of -25% by 2030. Thanks to these achievements, TotalEnergies confirms its ambition to become a major player in the energy transition, committed to carbon neutrality in 2050, together with society. Moreover, with the launch of Care Together by TotalEnergies, the Company increases its commitments in terms of social responsibility. In addition to commitments specific to each affiliate, TotalEnergies guarantees compliance with high social standards for all its employees worldwide, regardless of the legislation in force in any given country. This program is based on concrete measures revolving around four pillars: social protection, health, the family sphere and working conditions. TotalEnergies will submit the Sustainability & Climate – 2024 Progress Report to a consultative vote at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 24, 2024 In accordance with the resolution approved by shareholders in May 2023 concerning TotalEnergies' ambition with respect to sustainable development and energy transition toward carbon neutrality, the Board of Directors is committed to report on the progress made in implementing the ambition to the Shareholders’ Meeting. The board will submit the Sustainability & Climate – 2024 Progress Report to a consultative vote of shareholders at the meeting of May 24, 2024. The report will be presented during an afternoon of thematic workshops on March 21, 2024 On March 21, 2024, TotalEnergies will present concrete examples of the implementation of its balanced transition strategy during an afternoon of thematic workshops, as part of the rollout of its Sustainability & Climate – 2024 Progress Report.

(the ""Company"" or ""Power Nickel"") (TSX-V: PNPN) (OTCBB: PNPNF) (Frankfurt: IVV) is pleased to announce that the drill program aiming at following up on the Wildcat high-grade PGM intersection has intersected the anticipated mineralized zone with five (5) additional holes. If confirmed by assay results, the current mineralized envelope is interpreted to extend to a minimum of 300 m below surface, and to a minimum of 200 m laterally, and remains open in all directions. As previously stated, (March 04,2024), PN-24-044 and PN-24-047 successfully intersected the chalcopyrite-rich zone initially discovered in Hole PN-23-031A. Based on the initial geometry obtained, a fan of multiple short off-section holes was drilled to test the continuity of the zone in all directions. While the western side appears to be thinner, holes drilled east of the discovery appears to show a significant increase in the overall thickness of the zone. The deepest hole to date, PN-24-051, intersected the zone at a depth of 275m below surface, but hole PN-24-050 (200m depth) only intersected weak mineralization This could suggest a ""pinch and swell"" geometry across the mineralized zone, and therefore a potential increase in thickness further west and at depth. (Figure 2). ""Near surface, one ounce per tonne discovery hole, now multiple extensions to this discovery South, West, and East, and visible showings several times larger than this discovery hole…open in all directions. If that doesn't get your blood pumping as a miner, I don't know what will! Yes, we need to wait for assays but in our view, this is a material news release,"" commented Power Nickel CEO, Terry Lynch. ""As mentioned in our last release, the very encouraging observations made in the first two (2) follow-up holes led us to focus aggressively on this target. Our most recent hole, PN-24-053, suggests a important increase in thickness to the east, with our observation that the zone remains open in all directions… We expect to receive assay results in April. In the meantime, we are ""crunching"" the new information and preparing additional drilling targets to test the East, West and Vertical extensions. If the grade is maintained, these holes will deliver an exciting addition of very valuable PGE mineralization to our current Mineral Resource Estimate, which is planned to be updated in H2 2024"" stated Kenneth Williamson, Power Nickel's VP Exploration. Qualified PersonKenneth Williamson, Géo, M.Sc., VP Exploration at Power Nickel, is the qualified person who has reviewed and approved the technical disclosure contained in this news release. About Power Nickel Inc.Power Nickel is a Canadian junior exploration company focusing on developing the High-Grade Nisk project into Canada's first Carbon Neutral Nickel mine. On February 1, 2021, Power Nickel (then called Chilean Metals) completed the acquisition of its option to acquire up to 80% of the Nisk project from Critical Elements Lithium Corp. (CRE: TSXV). Subsequently, Power Nickel has exercised its option to acquire 50% of the Nisk Project and delivered notice to Critical Elements that it intends to exercise its second option to bring its ownership to 80%. The last remaining commitment to exercise the option was the delivery of a NI-43-101 Technical report which has now occurred. Power Nickel expects to complete the acquisition in February. The figure below presents a longitudinal view of the current 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate. The information presented above is derived from the Technical Report titled: ""Amended and Updated NI 43-101 Technical Report and Updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the Nisk Project, Eeyou Istchee James Bay Territory, Québec""; Duncan Studd, Pierre-Luc Richard, Gordon Marrs and Jeffrey Cassoff; January 19th, 2024. The NISK property comprises a significant land position (20 kilometers of strike length) with numerous high-grade intercepts.

(“PharmAla” or the “Company”) (CSE: MDMA) (OTC:MDXXF), a biotechnology company focused on the research, development, and manufacturing of LaNeo™ MDMA and novel derivatives of MDMA (MDXX class molecules), is thrilled to announce that allowance has been granted for the Composition of Matter of its PharmAla-1 (P-1) molecule by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). P-1 is an enantiomerically pure composition of ((R)-2-[(2H-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)methyl]pyrrolidine. “In proof-of-concept rodent models at the laboratory of Prof. William Fantegrossi, P-1 showed a number of features which we believe to be extremely valuable in a therapeutic context,” said Dr. Harpreet Kaur, Vice President of Research at PharmAla Biotech. “The molecule has an excellent therapeutic window; it shows a strong pro-social signal at dosage levels far below racemic MDMA. We also believe it can induce neuroplasticity, like many drugs in the tryptamine class, by crossing the cell membrane and binding to serotonin receptors within the cell. And of course, like all the molecules we choose to develop, P-1 has an excellent safety profile with low abuse liability.” The composition was identified through PharmAla’s computational chemistry program at the University of Windsor, made possible by a grant from the Ontario Centres of Innovation. P-1 was submitted to the USPTO through the Patent Prosecution Highway program, allowing for accelerated patent examination. As the molecule is ready for pre-clinical and clinical development, the Company has elected to change its designation to APA-001. “We foresee that APA-001 could potentially be used in a number of indications. The company is currently assessing those indications which show the most promise,” said Nick Kadysh, Founding CEO, PharmAla Biotech. “The potential for a drug that could not only assist with psychological trauma, but also neurological damage, could find broad applicability in the treatment of conditions such as Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and stroke. In addition there is potential applicability for the fear disorders often discussed in the context of MDMA.” About PharmAla PharmAla Biotech Holdings Inc. (CSE: MDMA)(OTCQB:MDXXF) is a biotechnology company focused on the research, development, and manufacturing of MDXX class molecules, including MDMA. PharmAla was founded with a dual focus: alleviating the global backlog of generic, clinical-grade MDMA to enable clinical trials as well as commercial sales in selected jurisdictions, and to develop novel drugs in the same class.

Legacy-Huazhu's RevPAR in 2023 showed a robust resurgence, with revenue surging over 50% year-over-year, exceeding guidance. Positive RevPAR in Q4 2023 for Legacy-Huazhu business recovered to 120% of the 2019 level, with ADR increasing to RMB284. Legacy-Huazhu's RevPAR in 2023 reached 122% of the 2019 level, driven by ADR growth and continuous recovery in occupancy rate. Revenue in Q4 2023 was RMB5.6 billion, a 50.7% increase year-over-year, with Legacy-Huazhu revenue increasing by 59.0%. Net income attributable to H World Group was RMB743 million in Q4 2023, compared to a net loss of RMB124 million in Q4 2022. For the full year of 2023, the Group's revenue increased by 57.9% year-over-year to RMB21.9 billion, with net income of RMB4.1 billion. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported recovery in Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR) for H World Group Limited is a significant indicator of the post-pandemic resurgence in the hospitality sector, particularly in China. The increase to 122% of 2019 levels suggests a strong rebound in consumer confidence and travel activity, likely spurred by easing travel restrictions and pent-up demand. This rebound is a testament to the company's strategic positioning and could signal a broader recovery trend within the industry.It's noteworthy that the Average Daily Rate (ADR) and Occupancy (OCC) rates have contributed to this growth, implying a balanced recovery driven by both price and volume. The robust year-on-year revenue surge of over 50% and the outperformance of the company's revenue guidance are indicative of operational efficiency and market demand alignment. The strategic expansion into resilient low-tier cities may have played a role in capturing new market segments and diversifying revenue streams. Financial Analyst The financial performance of H World Group Limited, as evidenced by the significant increase in net income and EBITDA, reflects strong operational leverage and cost management. The transition from a net loss in 2022 to substantial profitability in 2023 is a clear indicator of effective turnaround strategies and possibly improved margins. This performance also provides a healthy financial position for the company, as demonstrated by the declared cash dividend, which includes a substantial special dividend, signaling confidence in the company's cash flow and financial stability.Investors might view the repurchase of shares as a positive signal regarding the company's valuation and management's belief in the intrinsic value of the company. However, it is essential to monitor how these capital allocation decisions impact the company's long-term growth prospects and whether they align with shareholder interests. Hospitality Industry Expert The reported figures for H World Group Limited underscore the resilience of the hospitality sector, particularly in the limited-service market where the company maintains a leading position. The emphasis on high-quality products and the sophisticated regional framework for expansion are likely contributing factors to the company's strong performance. The growth in both ADR and OCC signifies a competitive edge in pricing power and customer retention.As the company expands its hotel network, it is important to maintain service standards and operational efficiency to sustain growth. The focus on low-tier cities is an interesting strategy that could mitigate risks associated with over-reliance on top-tier markets and tap into the growing domestic travel market in China. This strategy could provide a blueprint for other hospitality companies looking to diversify and strengthen their market presence. 03/20/2024 - 11:14 AM Full Year RevPAR in China Recovered to 122% of the 2019 Level SINGAPORE and SHANGHAI, March 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- H World Group Limited (""H World"" or ""the Group"", NASDAQ: HTHT and HKEX: 1179) announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter (""Q4 2023"") and full year ended December 31, 2023.

(NASDAQ: SBGI) today announced that it will carry Tennis Channel’s T2 as a free, streaming, virtual channel in all of its markets nationwide that have deployed the new NextGen Broadcast standard (ATSC 3.0). T2 is Tennis Channel’s second television network. The channel is broadly accessible, especially to younger-adult viewers, and includes matches from the men’s and women’s professional tours and team-cup competitions, as well as the French Open (Roland Garros), one of the sport’s four majors. Other programming includes original series, short-form features and documentaries exclusive to T2. The T2 virtual channel will be available via Sinclair NextGen Broadcast stations. Currently, Sinclair is using the NextGen Broadcast standard in 43 markets. Carriage of a broadcast-enabled virtual channel involves transmitting programming data within the NextGen Broadcast service allowing over-the-air viewers with a connected NextGen TV to see and select the channel in their programming guide while the channel is delivered over the Internet. Significantly, the T2 programming will use Advanced HDR by Technicolor®. HDR presents the viewer with better contrast, higher brightness, and a wider range of colors, creating a more realistic and immersive visual experience. NextGen Broadcasting is a revolutionary over-the-air digital broadcast technology that uses the Internet and digital applications powered by the ATSC 3.0 broadcast standards to present viewers with more news and entertainment choices while providing broadcasters with a more compelling and interactive way to deliver their content.

This means hours and hours of daily, continuous play and original programming that only exists on T2.” Mike Kralec, Sinclair’s Chief Technology Officer, added, “We are excited to expand the reach of T2, improve the viewer experience with HDR, and extend our flexible cloud distribution strategies. Delivering high quality programming via connected smart TV provides an initial path for distribution that can precede that same programming eventually being received over-the-air.” Carriage of T2 as a broadcast-enabled virtual channel coincides with Sinclair’s recent offer to carry public broadcast stations as virtual channels in its markets where the public station is not part of the initial over-the-air NextGen Broadcast deployment. This effort is geared to ‘prime the pump’ for later broadcast carriage to all viewers.

IGC Pharma Announces Positive Interim Results for IGC-AD1 in Reducing Alzheimer’s Agitation,2024-03-20T15:00:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"IGC Pharma, Inc. announces positive interim results for IGC-AD1 in treating Agitation in dementia from Alzheimer’s Disease.

IGC-AD1 demonstrates potential as a transformative therapeutic option with a large market opportunity.","IGC Pharma Announces Positive Interim Results for IGC-AD1 in Reducing Alzheimer’s Agitation Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary IGC Pharma, Inc. announces positive interim results for IGC-AD1 in treating Agitation in dementia from Alzheimer’s Disease. The Phase 2 trial shows a significant reduction in agitation compared to placebo, with a Cohen’s d effect size of 0.66 and LS mean difference of -10.45. IGC-AD1 demonstrates potential as a transformative therapeutic option with a large market opportunity. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent findings from IGC Pharma's Phase 2 trial are indicative of IGC-AD1's potential efficacy in treating Agitation in dementia from Alzheimer’s Disease (AAD). The reported statistically significant reduction in agitation scores, as measured by the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), suggests that the treatment could be a promising addition to the limited pharmacological options currently available for managing AAD.From a medical research perspective, the Cohen’s d effect size of 0.66 is noteworthy, as it reflects a moderate to large effect, which is substantial in the context of clinical trials. The comparison with Brexpiprazole, an FDA-approved atypical antipsychotic, is particularly interesting. IGC-AD1's effect size and LS mean difference are larger than those reported in Brexpiprazole's trials, although direct comparisons should be approached with caution due to differences in trial design and duration. It's also critical to consider that current treatments often come with severe warnings, highlighting the need for safer alternatives. Healthcare Economist Alzheimer's disease poses a significant economic burden on the healthcare system, with agitation symptoms being a major driver of increased care costs. The introduction of IGC-AD1 could potentially reduce hospitalization rates and the need for additional medication, thereby alleviating both the economic and emotional burden on caregivers and the healthcare infrastructure.Given the high prevalence of AAD, with an estimated 76% of the 6.7 million Americans with Alzheimer's experiencing agitation, the market opportunity for an effective treatment is considerable. However, the long-term economic impact will hinge on the drug's pricing, insurance coverage and accessibility. The cost-effectiveness of IGC-AD1, compared to existing treatments with black box warnings, will be a key factor in its adoption and market penetration. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The positive interim results of IGC-AD1 could have a meaningful impact on IGC Pharma's market valuation and investor confidence. The drug's potential to fill an unmet medical need in a large and growing patient population is likely to attract attention from both investors and larger pharmaceutical companies interested in expanding their neurology portfolios.However, it's important to note that the data is interim and based on a small sample size. The full trial results will be critical in determining the drug's commercial viability. Investors should be aware of the risks associated with clinical trials, including the possibility that later results may not replicate early positive outcomes. Additionally, the path to commercialization includes regulatory hurdles and potential competition from other pharmaceutical companies working on similar treatments. 03/20/2024 - 11:00 AM - Interim Data: Study Achieves Primary End Point Demonstrating Clinical and Statistically Significant Reductions Compared to Placebo in Agitation Associated with Dementia Due to Alzheimer’s Disease - POTOMAC, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- IGC Pharma, Inc. (“IGC Pharma”, “IGC”, or the “Company”) (NYSE American: IGC) today announced the results of an interim analysis of its ongoing Phase 2 trial investigating IGC-AD1 as a treatment for Agitation in dementia from Alzheimer’s Disease (“AAD”). The interim data demonstrates a clinical and statistically significant reduction in agitation compared to placebo in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, indicating strong therapeutic potential for IGC-AD1. The study's primary goal is to assess the change in AAD after six weeks using a standard scale, the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory (“CMAI”). Based on interim data, patients taking IGC-AD1, on average, experienced a more significant reduction in agitation scores compared to those on placebo, and the positive effects were observed as early as week two of the trial. At the primary outcome, assessing the change in agitation as measured by the CMAI at week 6, the Cohen’s d effect size indicating the superiority of IGC-ADI over placebo was 0.66. The CMAI Least Square (“LS”) mean difference between active, and placebo was -10.45, with a p-value of 0.037 (for combined week two and week six results). In addition, at the pre-specified secondary endpoint, change at week two, the effect size was 0.79. The Cohen’s d is a standardized statistical effect size that describes the magnitude of the difference between two groups, taking into account the variability in outcomes. Pre-Specified Interim Results: The IGC-AD1 Phase 2 is an ongoing multi-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that continues to enroll. IGC-AD1 is an oral liquid formulation administered twice daily for six weeks with no placebo run-in and titration to full dose over two days. Agitation is rated at the trial site, at baseline, week 2, and week 6, by a trained practitioner using the CMAI, a scale designed to measure AAD. ""We are excited with the positive interim results from the Phase 2 trial of IGC-AD1 for agitation in dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. IGC-AD1’s interim results demonstrate a clinical and statistically significant reduction in agitation compared to placebo, suggesting a strong plausibility to address a substantial unmet medical need. This interim data validates IGC-AD1's potential as a transformative therapeutic option with a large market opportunity in Alzheimer's disease management. We are actively pursuing next steps, including with regulators, and remain committed to advancing IGC-AD1 toward commercialization. We foresee a medication that can help alleviate caregiver burden and family distress as managing Alzheimer’s patients, especially ones with agitation, can have a significant emotional toll on families. With IGC-AD1's promising clinical profile, we are confident in its ability, subject to further trials, to improve patient outcomes and drive shareholder value,” said Ram Mukunda, CEO of IGC Pharma. IGC-AD1 interim Statistics Table 1 sets out the difference in LS mean from the baseline CMAI score for the active and the placebo groups at week six. The LS mean CMAI score difference between the active and placebo groups at week six is -10.45. At weeks 2 and 6, the interim Cohen's d effect size is 0.79 and 0.66, respectively, with a p-value of 0.037 for weeks 2 and 6 combined. This interim data suggests clinical and statistically significant improvement in AAD for the group receiving IGC-AD1 compared to placebo. Comparison with Existing Treatment In May 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved Brexpiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, with a boxed warning. This approval followed a significantly larger 12- week Phase 3 trial, which showed a difference in LS mean from baseline CMAI between active and placebo of -5.32, a Cohen's d effect size of 0.35, and a p-value of 0.003 (Lee et al., 2023). The findings from several Brexpiprazole trials are summarized in Table 1 below. Table 1.

IGC-AD1 as a Treatment for Agitation in Alzheimer’s Disease In 2023, the number of Americans living with Alzheimer’s was estimated at 6.7 million. According to one estimate, as many as 76% of them suffer from AAD (Van der Mussele et al., 2015), which is associated with an accelerated cognitive decline, increased caregiver burden, increased hospitalization, and increased need for medication, all significantly diminishing the quality of life for patients. Current therapies carry black box warnings, indicative of serious adverse reactions that may lead to death or serious injury. IGC-AD1 is designed to target AAD’s underlying causes and address the unmet need for a safe and effective therapy. Neuroinflammation, neurotransmitter imbalance, and CB1 receptor dysfunctions are all associated with agitation in Alzheimer’s disease (Yasuno et al., 2023; Manuel et al., 2014). In addition, upregulation of inflammasome-3 has been shown to lead to neuroinflammation, consequently leading to aggressive behavior (Yu et al., 2023). IGC-AD1’s formulation combines a CB1 receptor partial agonist with anti-neuroinflammatory properties that help balance neurotransmitter imbalance and an inflammasome inhibitor that targets the upregulation of inflammasome-3. The 146-pateint IGC-AD1 trial, for which these interim results are presented, continues to enroll in the U.S. and Canada. As the interim results are based on a small number of patients (n=26), there is no guarantee that the positive interim results will hold up as more patients are enrolled in the trial.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The provision of senior secured credit facilities by O2 Sponsor Finance to Corridor Capital for the acquisition of Association Headquarters represents a strategic financial maneuver with significant implications for the involved entities. This form of lending is typically reserved for borrowers with a strong credit profile, as it involves collateralizing assets to secure the loan. The involvement of O2 Sponsor Finance suggests a vote of confidence in Corridor Capital's strategic direction and the future performance of Association Headquarters.From a financial perspective, the terms of the credit facilities, such as the interest rate and repayment schedule, will be critical in determining the financial health of the acquisition. The leverage taken on by Corridor Capital could influence their balance sheet and cash flow, impacting their ability to invest in growth or weather economic downturns. Stakeholders should monitor how this debt influences the company's financial ratios, especially its debt-to-equity ratio and interest coverage ratio, which are key indicators of financial stability. Market Research Analyst In the context of the broader market, the acquisition of Association Headquarters by Corridor Capital, supported by O2 Sponsor Finance, may signal consolidation trends within the industry. Association Headquarters' position as an industry leader suggests it has a substantial market share, which Corridor Capital could leverage to enhance its competitive edge. The acquisition could enable Corridor Capital to diversify its portfolio, expand its service offerings, or realize synergies that improve operational efficiency.For competitors and the market at large, this move could catalyze a series of strategic realignments. It is essential to analyze the potential market impact, including changes in competitive dynamics, customer concentration and bargaining power. Such an acquisition could also prompt regulatory scrutiny depending on the market share involved and the industry's competitive landscape. Economist The transaction facilitated by O2 Sponsor Finance is indicative of the current economic environment's influence on corporate finance strategies. In periods of low interest rates, acquisitions tend to increase as companies take advantage of cheaper borrowing costs. Conversely, in a high-interest-rate environment, the cost of servicing debt rises, which can deter such deals or strain the acquirer's financials post-acquisition.Furthermore, the economic outlook can affect the future revenue streams of Association Headquarters. If the acquisition is predicated on growth forecasts that fail to materialize due to an economic downturn, Corridor Capital may face challenges in achieving the expected return on investment. Investors should consider macroeconomic factors and industry-specific trends when evaluating the potential success of this acquisition. 03/20/2024 - 11:00 AM CHICAGO, IL / ACCESSWIRE / March 20, 2024 / O2 Sponsor Finance, a division of Old Second National Bank, today announced that it provided senior secured credit facilities to support Corridor Capital in its acquisition of Association Headquarters, LLC (""Association HQ"").""We are excited to support Corridor Capital in its acquisition of Association HQ.

TFF Pharmaceuticals Announces $1.2 Million Registered Direct Offering Priced At-The-Market Under Nasdaq Rules,2024-03-20T16:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"TFF Pharmaceuticals (TFFP) announces a registered direct offering and private placement of common stock and warrants. The Company will sell 147,500 shares at $8.00 per share, with warrants to purchase additional shares.","TFF Pharmaceuticals Announces $1.2 Million Registered Direct Offering Priced At-The-Market Under Nasdaq Rules Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary TFF Pharmaceuticals (TFFP) announces a registered direct offering and private placement of common stock and warrants. The Company will sell 147,500 shares at $8.00 per share, with warrants to purchase additional shares. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent move by TFF Pharmaceuticals to issue new shares and concurrent warrants at a set price of $8.00 per share is a strategic initiative to raise capital. It is essential to look at the dilutive effect this might have on existing shareholders. When a company issues more shares, the ownership percentage of current shareholders decreases, potentially leading to a drop in share value. However, this capital infusion can be beneficial if used effectively for research, development, or expansion, potentially leading to long-term growth.Another aspect to consider is the exercise price of the warrants. The fact that it is set at the same price as the direct offering suggests a neutral stance from the company regarding the short-term volatility of its stock price. The five and one-half year expiration on the warrants provides a long-term incentive for investors, which could indicate the company's confidence in its future prospects.Finally, the 'at-the-market' nature of the offering suggests that the pricing is in line with the current market valuation, which can be seen as a positive sign that the company is not undervalued by the market. However, investors should monitor the company's use of the raised funds to ensure that it translates into tangible growth. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the announcement by TFF Pharmaceuticals to conduct a registered direct offering and a private placement of warrants can signal several things. Firstly, it reflects the company's need to raise capital outside of traditional debt financing, which could be indicative of a strategy to preserve cash flow or avoid incurring additional debt. The market's response to such news typically hinges on investor confidence in the company's growth trajectory and the perceived value of the TFF technology platform.It is also important to assess the market conditions at the time of the offering. If the biopharmaceutical sector is experiencing bullish trends, the offering may be well-received and could even attract new investors looking for innovative healthcare investments. Conversely, in a bearish market, the additional shares could put pressure on the stock price. The company's decision to price the warrants at the same level as the share offering price could be interpreted as a strategic move to stabilize the stock price in volatile market conditions.Investors should also keep an eye on the company's pipeline and any upcoming milestones that could be funded by this capital raise, as these events could significantly impact the stock's performance in the future. Biotech Industry Analyst In the context of the biopharmaceutical industry, TFF Pharmaceuticals' use of its Thin Film Freezing (TFF) technology platform is a noteworthy element in evaluating the company's potential. This technology, which is patented, represents a unique approach to drug delivery and product formulation. The capital raised through the stock and warrant offering could be pivotal in advancing the company's clinical trials or scaling up production capabilities.Understanding the competitive landscape is crucial. If TFF Pharmaceuticals can harness its TFF technology to create products with a competitive edge, such as improved efficacy or delivery mechanisms, the capital raised could be instrumental in gaining market share. However, the industry is highly competitive and success hinges on not just innovation, but also on regulatory approvals and market acceptance.The timing of the offering relative to the company's development milestones can also be telling. If it coincides with upcoming trial results or regulatory submissions, it may suggest that the company is positioning itself financially to move quickly should those results be positive. Conversely, if there are no immediate catalysts, the offering could be aimed at extending the company's operational runway in anticipation of longer-term goals. 03/20/2024 - 12:00 PM FORT WORTH, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TFF Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Nasdaq: TFFP) (the “Company” or “TFF Pharmaceuticals”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative drug products based on its patented Thin Film Freezing (TFF) technology platform, today announced that it has entered into definitive agreements for the purchase and sale of 147,500 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $8.00 per share in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/20/2024 - 11:30 AM NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / March 20, 2024 / When it comes to successfully spinning off companies, Ellery Roberts knows a thing or two about that. As the Chief Executive of 1847 Holdings LLC. (AMEX:EFSH), the diversified acquisition holding company, he is tasked with finding small businesses to acquire, grow and then either spin off or fold into the portfolio of companies it owns. That strategy seems to already be paying off in the few years since 1847 opened its doors. ""We took 1847 Goedeker's public in July 2020 after purchasing it in April 2019 for $6 million. It went public with a valuation of just under $60 million,"" said Roberts in a recent interview with Benzinga. ""After repaying a convertible note it all went to shareholders in the form of freely distributable shares. The stock traded at $9 and peaked at $18. All the while 1847 holders were able to sell shares and reap the returns.""Expertise Pays OffRobert credits the public holding company's success with 1847 Goedeker's to the company's expertise in identifying small businesses to acquire on the cheap. It targets small businesses with about $5 million of EBITDA and then deploys resources to strengthen the enterprise and improve operations positioning it for a sale or IPO. 1847 Holdings looks for U.S. companies that have the potential for breakout returns and are well-positioned within their respective industries.""We hit the nail on the head with 1847 Goedeker's"" which is an online purveyor of appliances, furniture and home goods direct to consumers, says Roberts. ""There was a huge push into direct-to-consumer and then COVID hit and direct-to-consumer valuations exploded. We owned an asset in the direct-to-consumer space and took advantage of the capital market valuations.""Another Exit Coming?1847 is hoping to replicate that success with some of the other companies it has in its portfolio. 1847 Cabinets Inc., a designer, manufacturer and installer of cabinets, doors and millwork for residential construction is a prime example. 1847 recently engaged Spartan Capital Securities, LLC., a U.S. investment bank, to explore a potential spin-off of 1847 Cabinets into a separate publicly traded company, or a different potential strategic transaction to capitalize on 1847 Cabinet's internal growth and favorable outlook for the business. ""Based on 1847 Cabinets' strong track record, we believe this would be the ideal time to pursue a spin-off or other strategic transaction, similar to our prior IPO and spin-off of 1847 Goedeker's,"" Roberts said. ""Spartan Capital brings a strong track record working with middle-market businesses, and we are highly confident in the prospects for this transaction given their solid track record.""1847 Cabinet includes Kyle's, a Boise, Idaho, kitchen and bathroom cabinetry company, High Mountain - the Reno, Nevada, carpentry products and services company - and Innovative Cabinets, also based in Reno, which specializes in custom cabinetry and countertops.Double Digit GrowthFor Q3 2023, 1847 Cabinets posted 30% year-over-year growth in revenue, benefiting from a shift to the multi-family home market - which is more resilient in the face of rising interest rates, says Roberts. It also operates in a section of the U.S. which is seeing strong demand. ""Idaho and Nevada are two areas where there is significant population and job growth"" which benefits 1847 Cabinets, said Roberts. 1847 Cabinets is more profitable on a stand-alone basis than FGI Industries Ltd., a publicly traded company focused on cabinets. It's important to note, however, that there is no guarantee the process will result in a spin-off or strategic exit of 1847 Cabinets since the company hasn't set a timetable for the completion of the process.With a focus on consumer-facing small businesses and a long track record in nurturing and growing enterprises, Roberts and 1847 Holdings believe it's well-positioned to successfully spin off the companies it acquires now and in the future, unlocking value for shareholders.Featured photo by R ARCHITECTURE on Unsplash.Contact:Ellery Robertseroberts@1847holdings.comSOURCE: 1847 Holdings LLCView the original press release on accesswire.com What is the name of the seasoned expert in spinning off companies mentioned in the press release?

Meeting the New SEC Emissions Policies: We Already Have All the Technology We Need,2024-03-20T15:30:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"The U.S. SEC mandates large U.S.-listed companies to disclose climate-related risks, focusing on Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

SAP embraces this ruling, offering technology to monitor emissions, reduce costs, and streamline business processes. The SEC's decision not to include Scope 3 emissions has sparked debate, with critics citing reporting burdens and others pushing for broader disclosures. Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Compliance Expert The SEC's new rule mandating disclosure of climate-related risks for large U.S.-listed public companies signifies a shift towards greater corporate accountability in environmental impact. This policy aligns with global trends where environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria are becoming critical in investment decisions. The required reporting on Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which cover direct emissions and indirect emissions from purchased electricity and fuel, will compel companies to undertake more rigorous carbon accounting practices.For investors, this transparency can highlight potential risks and opportunities associated with a company's environmental impact. The long-term benefits may include the identification of companies that are better positioned to handle the transition to a low-carbon economy, which could be a factor in investment resilience. However, the exclusion of Scope 3 emissions, which can represent a significant portion of a company's carbon footprint, may limit the comprehensiveness of these disclosures. The SEC's decision may also prompt businesses to invest in technologies that enable more accurate carbon tracking, potentially leading to innovation in sustainability practices. Sustainability Technology Analyst From a technological standpoint, the SEC ruling is a catalyst for the adoption of advanced digital solutions like those offered by SAP. The integration of sustainability data with enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems can transform how companies manage their environmental impact. By embedding carbon management into business processes, companies can achieve a more holistic view of their operations and make informed decisions that align with sustainability goals.Furthermore, the use of cloud-based ERP systems and business AI for sustainability management represents an intersection of technology and corporate responsibility. The ability for companies to not only comply with regulations but also to optimize operations for sustainability indicates a significant market for enterprise software solutions. The proactive stance of companies like SAP in this domain suggests that they may benefit from increased demand for their services as businesses seek to align with new regulatory frameworks and improve their sustainability performance. Market Analyst The announcement by the SEC may have a ripple effect on the stock market, particularly for companies in sectors with high environmental impact. Investors may start to scrutinize the disclosed data to assess companies' climate-related risks and their management strategies. This scrutiny could lead to a reevaluation of company valuations, especially for those that are not perceived to be managing their environmental risks effectively.In the short term, companies may face increased costs associated with compliance and the potential need for new systems and processes. However, in the long term, the market may reward companies that demonstrate strong sustainability credentials with higher valuations and lower cost of capital. The emphasis on technology to aid compliance and drive sustainability initiatives also suggests that companies providing these solutions could see a surge in business, potentially affecting their stock performance positively. 03/20/2024 - 11:30 AM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 20, 2024 / SAPFeature by Sophia Mendelsohn The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced new rules requiring many large U.S.-listed public companies to disclose climate-related risks that have a material impact on their financials, operations, or business strategy.Specifically, companies registered with the SEC now must disclose their Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as in those resulting from both their direct emissions and purchases of electricity and fuel.Calculate your carbon footprint from cradle to gate with SAP technologyLearn moreCritics of the ruling say it adds to the burden of reporting to multiple government agencies. Others believe the SEC is not going far enough, as its decision does not require the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions, which are generated by a company's suppliers and customers.Among the reasons the SEC decided against mandating the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions was the potential difficulty in collecting and measuring this data as well as potential high costs.At SAP, we embrace the SEC's ruling not just as a regulatory measure, but as a promising avenue for companies to thrive by leveraging technology to harness the power of business data.We are not merely observing from the sidelines; we are actively partnering with our customers to empower them in accurately monitoring emission, reducing energy costs, and streamlining their business processes.Our commitment goes beyond compliance - we are dedicated to enabling companies to stay agile in both voluntary and mandatory reporting, recognizing the ever-evolving landscape of emissions disclosure regulations. This sentiment is underscored not only by the recent SEC rule but also by the stringent laws such as the one passed last year in California and the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).SAP has the technology to make Scope 3 emissions accurate, granular, and stable. We are seeing customers adopt digital technologies that will enable them to comply with all existing and anticipated regulatory requirements around the world up and down their value chains to track emissions accurately, including Scope 3, where applicable.From our experience, sustainability management solutions from SAP can benefit businesses while helping them stay compliant with local and global regulations. SAP makes end-to-end carbon management seamless by embedding it into business processes through a cloud-based enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. This offers companies the ability to create a green ledger by connecting their financial data with accurate and verifiable emissions data. When this data is connected, they can innovate their operations and supply chains to be more sustainable and competitive.The essence of the SEC's impact lies in our unwavering belief in collaboration. Our business-to-business network enables our customers to meet the challenge of disclosing emissions data under various reporting requirements. This ability to accurately track emissions allows companies' stakeholders, including their supply chain partners, to access that information on public websites or mobile apps so they can meet and even exceed the most stringent reporting requirements.With SAP's enterprise solutions, companies can operate today while increasing the overall availability and transparency of carbon data. These same solutions also allow for the proactive identification of supply chain partners so companies can further decrease their carbon emissions. Concurrently, government agencies can easily access companies' emissions data using already available enterprise software to improve their emissions reduction goals.SAP's Holistic Approach to Cloud-Based Sustainability and Business TransformationThe reality of our future economy is that it is cloud-based and sustainable. That's why we see our customers transitioning to more agile business models that drive sustainable outcomes.SAP guides them through this new reality by providing the technology that allows for their business process shifts across their value chains. Whether they are new local or regional emissions rules, plastic taxes or extended producer responsibility requirements, SAP is ready to work with customers to minimize any disruptions with these new reporting requirements.With a comprehensive and integrated approach to sustainability, SAP solutions move beyond compliance and operationalize sustainability across companies' operations. Customers can build on their ERP solutions over time, transforming business processes for maximum sustainable impact. Companies can also deploy SAP Business AI to inform, predict, and optimize sustainable outcomes. These same tools can leverage sustainability regulations and help companies achieve business process transformation.We are hopeful that governments will advance carbon accounting globally. Taking that step will harmonize regional and global reporting frameworks and ensure optimal reuse of companies' existing data flows and business processes.This SEC decision makes it more important than ever for companies to use digital technologies to track their emissions accurately and not rely on estimated data that often undercounts carbon emissions.Regulations can actually drive innovation. We are in a world where businesses must pivot quickly due to externalities like economic shocks, political shifts, and climate-related disasters. SAP has the technology to help companies rapidly adapt to these changes and new regulations.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from SAP on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: SAPWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/sapEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: SAPView the original press release on accesswire.com What new rules did the U.S. SEC announce for large U.S.-listed companies?

It is often said to gauge our emotional, professional, personal, and even financial goals. When I decided to leave the retail management sector to use transferable skillsets, I never expected how rewarding it would be. No longer am I working 80 hours a week to execute on every holiday sales event, prepping for inventories for 6 weeks in a 130k-square-foot big box, or worrying about daily sales, shrink, etc.Although that was rewarding in many ways, my current role as a Logistics Manager for Quest Diagnostics has a whole different level of rewards. We all know how important our couriers' responsibilities are delivering patients' specimens to our labs for testing, and I've been fortunate to watch it as a first shift and second shift Supervisor before being promoted to Manager. But if you don't know how the Route Service Representative (RSR) performs their role, I'm here to tell you it is a beautiful, choreographed dance every day and night. It is rewarding to watch the RSR be empowered to suggest and make changes that not only benefit Quest, but the client in many ways. They are in control of their route. I've seen RSRs blossom, knowing we put our trust in them to help make the right decision that impacts quality and specimen arrival times to labs, reduces nonproductive stops, and conveys accurate messages so any number of people covering the route can do so successfully. RSRs are actively involved in daily route updates and optimizations. It is their tribal knowledge that helps us achieve the most productivity and efficiencies. I am proud to lead a team toward our shared common goals of Quality, Service, Safety, and Productivity. I appreciate Quest Diagnostics leadership for having trust in me to deliver results and take care of our employees who make it happen every day.

Scilex Holding Company Announces Seeking Approval from the FDA for Modification of the Gloperba® Label to Provide Specific Dosing Guidance for Patients with Renal Impairment and Other Circumstances Where Dose Adjustment is Needed,2024-03-20T15:00:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Scilex Holding Company (SCLX) seeks FDA approval to modify Gloperba® label for dosing flexibility, targeting gout patients with renal impairment. The market potential is significant with increasing gout cases and unmet needs.","Scilex Holding Company Announces Seeking Approval from the FDA for Modification of the Gloperba® Label to Provide Specific Dosing Guidance for Patients with Renal Impairment and Other Circumstances Where Dose Adjustment is Needed Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Scilex Holding Company (SCLX) seeks FDA approval to modify Gloperba® label for dosing flexibility, targeting gout patients with renal impairment. The market potential is significant with increasing gout cases and unmet needs. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The move by Scilex Holding Company to seek FDA approval for label modification of Gloperba® is a strategic step that could potentially increase the drug's market share within the gout treatment space. The emphasis on dosing flexibility and specific guidance for patients with renal impairment addresses a critical gap in patient care. Given that a significant portion of the gout patient population suffers from comorbid conditions such as renal or hepatic impairment, this label expansion could lead to increased adoption of Gloperba® among healthcare providers.Furthermore, the market potential for gout treatments is substantial, with projections indicating a growth to $2.0 billion by 2028 in the United States. Scilex's focus on non-opioid pain management products, including Gloperba®, positions the company favorably in a market that is increasingly wary of opioid use. The introduction of a liquid formulation of colchicine is innovative and it could become a differentiator for Scilex, potentially impacting their stock positively if the FDA approval is granted and the subsequent product launch is successful. Healthcare Provider From a clinical perspective, the introduction of a liquid formulation of colchicine, such as Gloperba®, is significant. It allows for more precise dosing, which is particularly beneficial for patients with varying degrees of renal impairment—a common issue among those with gout. Precision dosing can lead to better patient outcomes by reducing the risk of toxicity, which is a concern with colchicine, especially considering that over 17% of patients experience severe gastrointestinal side effects.The American College of Rheumatology's guidelines highlighting the need for such dosing flexibility underscores the clinical importance of this development. If the FDA approves the label modification, it could lead to a paradigm shift in how gout is managed, especially in patients with renal challenges and may influence prescribing habits in favor of Gloperba® over traditional tablet or capsule forms of colchicine. Health Economics Expert Considering the economic implications, Scilex's Gloperba® could offer cost-saving advantages to the healthcare system by potentially reducing the incidence of colchicine toxicity and associated hospitalizations. For patients, the extended duration of a single bottle due to lower dosing requirements translates to potential cost savings and convenience. This aspect should not be underestimated as it can improve medication adherence and overall treatment satisfaction.However, the long-term success of Gloperba® will depend on various factors, including competitive pricing, insurance coverage and the ability of Scilex to effectively communicate the benefits of their product to both patients and providers. The cost-effectiveness of Gloperba® compared to traditional colchicine tablets or capsules will be a critical factor in its market penetration and, by extension, its impact on Scilex's financial performance. 03/20/2024 - 11:00 AM Seek approval from the FDA for the modification of the Gloperba® label to include its ability to utilize dosing flexibility of liquid formulation to address unmet medical needs and provide specific dosing guidance to patients with renal impairment as set out below: Patients with mild or moderate renal or hepatic impairment should be considered for dose adjustment.For patients with severe renal impairment, the starting dose should be 0.3 mg/day.For patients undergoing dialysis, the total recommended dose should be 0.3 mg and be given twice a week. Gloperba® is the first and only liquid oral version of the anti-gout medicine colchicine indicated for the prophylaxis of painful gout flares in adults.Gout is a painful arthritic disorder affecting an estimated 9.2 million people in the United States1. As gout cases increase every year, treatment requirements increase. According to data gathered by Evaluate Pharma, the gout treatment market is projected to reach $2.0 billion in the United States by 2028 with a well-defined area of unmet need.2Over 70% of gout patients have comorbid conditions that may require dose adjustments and such patients could be potential target population for Gloperba®3Over 17% of gout patients on colchicine have experienced severe gastrointestinal side effects like diarrhea. These patients may benefit from flexible dosing offered by Gloperba®4 PALO ALTO, Calif., March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Scilex Holding Company (Nasdaq: SCLX, “Scilex” or “Company”), an innovative revenue-generating company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing non-opioid pain management products for the treatment of acute and chronic pain, today announced it will seek approval from the FDA for the modification of the Gloperba® label to include its ability to utilize dosing flexibility of liquid formulation to address unmet medical needs and provide specific dosing guidance to patients with renal impairment as set out below: Patients with mild or moderate renal or hepatic impairment should be considered for dose adjustment.For patients with severe renal impairment, the starting dose should be 0.3 mg/day.For patients undergoing dialysis, the total recommended dose should be 0.3 mg and be given twice a week. A recent market research study among rheumatologists revealed a high degree of interest in Gloperba® as a liquid colchicine formulation designed for precision dosing.5 Specifically, clinicians using colchicine for prophylaxis of gout flares in adults indicated a strong likelihood to use Gloperba® instead of tablets/capsules in certain at-risk patient populations who have a clinical need for lowered precision dosing to mitigate the risk of colchicine toxicity. Notably, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines also reflect this need.6 Scilex expects to launch Gloperba® in the first half of 2024. Gloperba® is the first and only liquid oral version of the anti-gout medicine colchicine indicated for the prophylaxis of painful gout flares in adults. Approximately 70% of gout patients have chronic kidney disease stage 2 and many suffer from gastrointestinal sensitivity, necessitating a lower dose of colchicine than the standard 0.6 mg tablet or capsule3. Gloperba® is the first and only liquid colchicine formulation that allows healthcare providers to prescribe precision dosing in these at-risk patient populations, and thereby help mitigate against severe toxicity in patients. Healthcare providers can now safely and effectively manage these patients at doses below 0.6 mg once or twice daily, which is the standard dose for prophylaxis. For patients who are treated at doses lower than 0.6 mg, the 150 ml bottle of Gloperba® is expected to last longer than 30 days, delivering additional value to patients.

(Nasdaq: SDGR), whose physics-based computational platform is transforming the way therapeutics and materials are discovered, today presented the discovery of SGR-1505, its MALT1 inhibitor, during the First Time Disclosure Session at the American Chemical Society (ACS) Spring 2024 Meeting. SGR-1505 is being evaluated in a Phase 1 dose-escalation study in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies. The oral presentation provided an overview of how Schrödinger leveraged its computational approaches at scale to discover SGR-1505. Schrödinger’s platform enabled vast exploration of chemical space, triaging 8.2 billion compounds, synthesizing 78 of the most promising molecules in the lead series, and identifying SGR-1505 as the company’s development candidate in approximately 10 months. Reaching a development candidate can take three to six years and typically involves synthesizing up to 5,000 molecules per program. “Designing the optimal molecule is a tremendous multi-parameter optimization challenge that requires balancing many key properties,” stated Aleksey Gerasyuto, Ph.D., head of medicinal chemistry at Schrödinger. “One of our goals in this program was to address the limitations reported with other MALT1 inhibitors. By leveraging our computational platform, our cross-functional team simultaneously and rapidly optimized key drug-like properties and designed several distinct chemical series, ultimately selecting SGR-1505 as our development candidate.” “We believe SGR-1505 has the potential to be a best-in-class compound. The preclinical profile of SGR-1505, coupled with positive data from our recently completed Phase 1 study in healthy subjects, further increases our conviction about our MALT1 program,” said Margaret Dugan, M.D., chief medical officer at Schrödinger. “Our Phase 1 study in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphomas is progressing well, and we look forward to reporting initial data from the study in late 2024 or 2025.” SGR-1505 Clinical Studies Schrödinger is conducting a Phase 1 dose-escalation study in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphomas to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary signals of therapeutic activity of SGR-1505 as a monotherapy. The study is enrolling patients at multiple sites in the U.S. and Europe. Once the recommended dose is determined, an expansion cohort is planned to evaluate SGR-1505 in combination with other anti-cancer agents, such as BTK and BCL-2 inhibitors, in patients with specific B-cell malignancies. Schrödinger recently completed a Phase 1 study showing that SGR-1505 was well tolerated in a Phase 1 study of 73 healthy volunteers. No drug-related serious adverse events or dose limiting toxicities were observed in the study. The data also confirmed target engagement, with greater than 90 percent inhibition of IL-2 secretion in activated T cells, a pharmacodynamic goal of the study. About Schrödinger Schrödinger is transforming the way therapeutics and materials are discovered. Schrödinger has pioneered a physics-based computational platform that enables discovery of high-quality, novel molecules for drug development and materials applications more rapidly and at lower cost compared to traditional methods. The software platform is licensed by biopharmaceutical and industrial companies, academic institutions, and government laboratories around the world.

USask will implement the SOPHiA DDM™ Platform for use in its cutting-edge clinical trial, which aims to substantially improve the quality of life for ovarian cancer patients through expanded genetic testing. This is the first clinical trial in Canada designed to improve ovarian cancer treatment decisions and inspire guideline changes to increase access to advanced testing. Ovarian cancer is the most fatal gynecologic cancer; only about 45 percent of patients in Canada survive more than five years after diagnosis.1 The current standard for ovarian cancer tumor testing in Canada tests only for the absence or presence of a BRCA mutation; this identifies only a fraction of patients with genetic changes in their tumor.2 The latest trial from USask will use additional genetic diagnostic tools, and the SOPHiA DDM™ Platform, to inform oncologists on a wider spread of genes and potential mutations, which can be indicative of whether a patient may respond better to a targeted therapy rather than chemotherapy. ""Using genetic testing to uncover tumor mutations and support treatment planning for cancer patients is a perfect example of precision medicine in practice. It's exactly what we at SOPHiA GENETICS are working so hard to make available to clinician researchers around the world,"" said John Carey, Managing Director, NORAM, SOPHiA GENETICS. ""The research being led by the USask Advanced Diagnostics Research Laboratory (ADRL) team to advance genomic analysis of patient tumors has the potential to drastically improve the lives of thousands throughout Canada, and we are honored our SOPHiA DDM™ Platform is a pivotal part of that research."" The SOPHiA DDM™ Comprehensive Profiling Solution coupled with SOPHiA GENETICS' proprietary deep learning algorithm, GIInger™, will provide USask with a widespread look at potential mutations for each patient. This testing will provide the researchers with detailed genomic information, including predicted treatment response, in an expedited timeframe using SOPHiA GENETICS' advanced AI and proprietary technology to analyze and interpret raw NGS data and provide reliable and fast results. USask's clinical trial aims to leverage these findings to enable providers to create a personalized treatment plan with the goal of patients no longer undergoing treatments that may not help control their cancer and that worsen their quality of life. ""Our clinical trial has the potential to create a paradigm shift for ovarian cancer care across Canada, helping to base treatment decisions in data to provide the most favorable patient outcomes,"" said Laura Hopkins, M.D., Saskatchewan Cancer Agency Gynecologic Oncologist and Co-lead of the clinical trial. USask molecular pathologist and director of the ADRL John DeCoteau, M.D., added, ""Our hope is that our research will help create increased access to this type of testing across Canada to provide patients with additional treatment choices and more personalized care."" HRD is caused by a cell's impaired ability to repair DNA double-stranded breaks through the homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway; it is an important predictor of tumor response to certain treatment options. HRD is linked with the development of several cancers3 including advanced ovarian cancer, and is the most prevalent alteration in ovarian cancer, with approximately half of all newly diagnosed patients having HRD-positive tumors.4 For more information on SOPHiA GENETICS, visit SOPHiAGENETICS.com or connect on X, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram.

We are therefore pleased to be in close discussions with potential pharma partners and global health authorities, which both confirm the relevance of our strategy. More specifically, the recent feedback received from the FDA and the EMA provide us with clear guidelines for the design of our next global Phase 2 study in Prosthetic Joint Infections. Furthermore, we are about to start the evaluation of our anti-Staphylococcus aureus phages in the endocarditis infections in France. Together, with the growing body of clinical data from the Compassionate and Early-Access treatments, we hope that we can successfully execute our clinical plan with anti-Staphylococcus aureus phages. The field is clearly moving fast forward, as shown by recent global deals, and we are well positioned to become a leading phage-therapy player able to address the most critical indications for which there is currently no relevant solution, particularly for Prosthetic Joint Infections, for which we are frontrunners.” MARKET HIGHLIGHTS Phage therapy sector in a spotlight with recent M&A and refinancing deals On March 6, 2024, BiomX, a clinical-stage phage-therapy company, announced the acquisition of Adaptive Phage Therapeutics (APT), concurrently with a private placement financing of $50 million, involving several top-tier institutional investors (Deerfield, Orbimed). In the meantime, Armata Pharmaceuticals announced a $35 million refinancing deal. These important transactions demonstrate the growing attractiveness of phage therapy, where PHAXIAM has a prominent role with its unique and leading positioning in Prosthetic Joint Infections (PJI), as the most advanced Phage therapy player in Europe. BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS a) Confirmed strategic focus on Phage Therapy in high-value indications with a strong competitive positionPHAXIAM has been refocusing its clinical development programs in indications of high medical needs, mainly for patients with severe and resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. Aureus) infections, often associated with high mortality and budget impact. This is particularly the case for PJI, where PHAXIAM has a reinforced strategic and leading position. With the signs of clinical activity, we are observing in our compassionate and early-access (AAC, Autorisation d’Accès Compassionnel – the French early access program) patients, and a best-suited approach of local administration of phages allowed in this indication, we strongly believe that PJI is the best option to bring phages as soon as possible as a first indication toward proof-of-concept and registration. Beyond PJI, as lead indication, PHAXIAM has launched another strategic clinical study (Phase I PK) in Endocarditis infections, reinforcing its ambition to be a leader in innovative therapies to those patients who failed traditional antimicrobial treatments. b) Significant progress in Clinical and Regulatory strategy for the S. aureus program Prosthetic Joint Infections (PJI): set for the first global Phase 2 study potentially enabling an Early Access Pathway in Europe Leveraging on promising activity signals from real-life compassionate treatments and valuable insights from the current PhagoDAIR pilot study, PHAXIAM is preparing the initiation of the 1st global (EU/US) Phase 2 study for PJI patients (Hip or Knee prosthesis) having an open-surgery debridement (DAIR) in combination with antibiotics. PHAXIAM has received positive and consistent feedback from both the FDA (Pre-IND meeting) and the EMA (Scientific Advice) with a view to launching this large-scale study, including the following key points and recommendations: Confirmation of the value of a clinical development in this indication;Confirmation that PHAXIAM’s non-clinical data and CMC capabilities support a formal clinical development plan in Europe and in the United States;Confirmation of the target population and the Standard of Care to be considered; the exclusion/inclusion criteria allow to target a population approximately 6 times larger compared to the current PhagoDAIR study;Clear and consistent guidelines and expectations in terms of CMC and clinical endpoints. PHAXIAM considers (1) accelerating the transitioning of PJI clinical development effort into the new and more ambitious global Phase 2 proof-of-concept study, (2) providing PhagoDAIR pilot study clinical data at the end of 2024. The Phase 2 proof-of-concept study is intended to be a multicentric, randomized, double-blind trial and is expected to include 100 patients in Europe and the US. PHAXIAM intends to file a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) with the EMA and the FDA in mid-2024 in view of starting patient enrollment in early 2025. Upon a successful completion of this clinical study (2H 2026), PHAXIAM may potentially open an Early Access Pathway for the registration of a first phage therapy treatment for PJI in Europe. Endocarditis Infections (EI): initiate a 2nd clinical study in an indication targeting vital cardiac valves infections PHAXIAM has obtained approvals from the French ANSM and South-East II-Lyon Ethics Committee to launch a phase 1 study (PK data) in Endocarditis Infections caused by S. aureus, to evaluate the safety of intravenous administration (IV) of its anti-S. aureus phages. The study, conducted in 5 French hospitals, is about to start and should enroll 12 patients requiring replacement of an infected heart valve.First clinical results are expected in H2 2024. If positive, these results could allow PHAXIAM to (1) accelerate a clinical development in this indication and to (2) use the IV administration for other indications requiring this administration route, such as bacteriemia. c) Robust real-life activity data obtained from compassionate treatmentsIn June 2022, the ANSM granted PHAXIAM an AAC (Autorisation d’Accès Compassionnel) and, to date, approximately 100 patients have already been treated under this regulatory status for different indications, with a majority in PJI indication. Data from the first 77 patients evaluated so far show promising results with infection control at 3 months (clinical endpoint), reaching approximately 80%, considered as a significant improvement over standard of care (SoC) in this hard-to-treat patient population with severe resistant infections, often undergoing 2nd or 3rd line SoC antibiotic treatment. PHAXIAM has applied for a second AAC regulatory validation, for PJI patients associated with P. aeruginosa resistance. This AAC is currently being evaluated by the ANSM for a potential final validation in 2024. d) Partnering optionsAs part of its strategic development strategy, PHAXIAM is entertaining partnership discussions with pharmaceutical companies, to investigate relevant collaboration options. e) Complementary Investigator-sponsored trialsIn addition to PHAXIAM’s clinical activities, two French university hospitals are preparing for Investigator-Sponsored Trials (IST) with PHAXIAM’s phages. These studies are the opportunity for PHAXIAM to potentially bring additional clinical POC data in other high-value indications: Phase 2 IST in Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU): this clinical study by Nîmes Hospitals, is targeting DFU infections due to mono-bacterial S. aureus infection.Phase 2 IST in complex Respiratory Tract Infections (VAP): this clinical study by La Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, is targeting nosocomial pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including patients with ventilation-associated pneumopathies (VAP), a growing concern in hospital environments. Investigator-initiated studies are funded by hospital’s clinical research programs and their execution and schedule are entirely under the responsibility of the sponsoring centers. FY 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS Key financial figures for the twelve months of 2023 compared with the same period of the previous year are summarized below. In the context of the Erytech-Pherecydes merger, PHAXIAM’s consolidated financial statements in IFRS standards include ex-Pherecydes financial results as from the date of the merger, i.e. June 23, 2023. Consequently, PHAXIAM’s P&L information for the full-year 2023 include 12 months of ex-Erytech activities and 6 months of ex-Pherecydes activities. In thousands of euros FY202312 monthsFY202212 monthsRevenues — —Net income from asset sale 24,351Other income 1,3266,647Operating income 1,32630,998Research and development (10,910)(19,907)General and administrative (14,076)(13,887)Operating expenses (24,986)(33,793)Operating income (loss) (23,660)(2,796)Financial income 4744,453Financial expenses (511)(1,364)Financial income (loss) 373,089Income tax 208(521)Net loss (23,488)(227) Operating expenses of €25.0 million in the full-year 2023 were €8.8 million lower (-26%) than in the previous year. The decrease was driven by the reduction of ex-Erytech R&D expenses, mostly related to the closing of Princeton operations and the termination of clinical development activities, while new ex-Pherecydes development activities were integrated in the P&L as of 2H 2023. Overall, R&D expenses were reduced by €9.0 million (-45%) year-over-year. PHAXIAM’s G&A expenses in the full-year 2023 were stable year-over-year (+€0.2 million, i.e. +1%), including one-off expenses related to the merger and integration activities. Net loss for the full-year 2023 was €23.5 million, compared with a net loss of €0.2 million for the same period of 2022, which benefited from the €24.4 million net gain on the sale of the Princeton facility in April 2022. As of December 31, 2023, PHAXIAM had cash and cash equivalents totaling €10.5 million (approximately $11.6 million), compared with €38.8 million as of December 31, 2022. The €28.3 million decrease in cash position during the twelve months of 2023 was the result of a €24.3 million net cash utilization in operating activities and investing activities and €3.7 million used in financing activities, mostly related to the reimbursement of the ‘PGE’ Covid-loan, while the variation of the U.S. dollar against the euro led to a €0.3 million negative currency exchange impact. The current cash position can fund PHAXIAM’s programs and planned operating expenses into September 2024. EFFECTIVENESS OF VOLUNTARY DELISTING OF AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES FROM NASDAQ STOCK MARKET On March 11, 2024, PHAXIAM announced that the Company’s voluntary delisting of American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) representing its ordinary shares from The Nasdaq Capital Market had become effective. This delisting significantly reduces PHAXIAM’s cash utilization and enables the Company to focus its financial resources on key development and value milestones. The Company remains listed on Euronext Paris as its primary trading market and intends to continue its disclosures in compliance with applicable French financial market regulations.

Shell publishes Energy Transition Strategy 2024 - CORRECTION,2024-03-20T15:29:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,Shell plc announces Energy Transition Strategy 2024 focusing on emissions reduction and low-carbon energy solutions. The company aims to halve emissions from its operations by 2030 and invest $10-15 billion in low-carbon energy solutions by 2025.,"Shell publishes Energy Transition Strategy 2024 - CORRECTION Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Shell plc announces Energy Transition Strategy 2024 focusing on emissions reduction and low-carbon energy solutions. The company aims to halve emissions from its operations by 2030 and invest $10-15 billion in low-carbon energy solutions by 2025. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Market Analyst Shell's commitment to halving emissions from its operations by 2030 represents a significant shift in the energy sector, with potential implications for market dynamics and investor confidence. The reduction of net carbon intensity by 6.3% since 2016 is indicative of Shell's strategic pivot towards sustainability, which could influence the company's long-term profitability and competitiveness. The investment of $10-15 billion in low-carbon energy solutions is a substantial capital allocation that may drive growth in renewable energy markets and provide Shell with a diversified energy portfolio. This diversification is essential in mitigating risks associated with the volatile oil market and positioning Shell as a leader in the energy transition. Investors should monitor the company's progress in achieving these targets, as they could impact Shell's market valuation and the broader energy sector. Environmental Policy Expert Shell's energy transition strategy aligns with global efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C, a goal of the Paris Agreement. The focus on reducing Scope 3 emissions by 15-20% by 2030 is particularly noteworthy as it addresses the end-use of products, which is often the most challenging area to decarbonize. This ambition could influence policy discussions and regulatory frameworks, potentially leading to increased market demand for companies that proactively engage in carbon reduction. Moreover, Shell's actions could set a precedent for other energy companies, potentially accelerating the industry's overall transition to low-carbon solutions. Stakeholders should consider the potential for regulatory changes that may favor or penalize companies based on their carbon reduction efforts. Sustainable Investment Analyst Shell's update on its energy transition strategy is a critical signal to sustainable investors. The company's focus on performance, discipline and simplification, along with clear targets for emission reduction, could make Shell a more attractive investment for ESG-focused funds. The shift towards low-carbon energy solutions and the sizeable investment earmarked for this transition suggest that Shell is positioning itself for resilience in a future low-carbon economy. This strategic direction may also influence the company's risk profile, as it seeks to navigate the transition while maintaining energy supply security and affordability. Investors interested in long-term sustainability and climate risk mitigation should evaluate how Shell's strategy compares to industry peers and its potential impact on future returns. 03/20/2024 - 11:29 AM Shell publishes Energy Transition Strategy 2024- CORRECTION The following sentence in the “More value with less emissions: our actions” – “Carbon capture and storage (CCS)” section is being re-presented due to an editorial error: “We are exploring the possibility of increasing CCS capacity at Scotford, initially by 750,000 tonnes a year.” The earlier announcement published at 07:10 on March 14, 2024 incorrectly stated: “We are exploring the possibility of increasing CCS capacity at Quest, initially by 750,000 tonnes a year.” All other details remain unchanged. The full updated announcement is set out below. The above change has been reflected in the Energy Transition Strategy 2024 (ETS24) which is available on the Shell website and has been marked with a footnote in the ETS24 itself. An updated version of the ETS24 has also been filed with the NSM. --- Shell will continue its drive to halve emissions from its operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 2030, compared with 2016 on a net basis. By the end of 2023, Shell had achieved more than 60% of this target. Shell also reduced the net carbon intensity of the energy products it sells by 6.3% compared with 2016, the third consecutive year it hit its target.To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, Shell has set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of its oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [A].Shell confirms it will invest $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making Shell a significant investor in the energy transition. London, 14 March 2024 – Shell plc (Shell) has published its first energy transition update since the launch of its Powering Progress strategy in 2021. At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the “more value” part. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers “less emissions”. Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Shell’s strategy supports a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies. “Energy has made an incredible contribution to human development, allowing many people around the world to live more prosperous lives. Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in recent years in many countries and technologies, which reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy,” said Wael Sawan, Shell’s Chief Executive Officer. “Shell has a very important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can have the greatest impact through the energy transition and create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition,” said Sawan. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a critical fuel in the energy transition, and we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. We are cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable, and growing sales of low-carbon energy solutions while gradually reducing sales of oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel. As one of the world’s largest energy traders, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil and gas. We have made good progress against our climate targets: By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. This goes above and beyond the targets set by signatories to the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter agreed at COP28.We continue to be an industry leader in reducing methane emissions. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we achieved 0.05% methane emissions intensity – significantly below our target of 0.2%. And in 2023 we also contributed to the World Bank’s Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Fund – further supporting industry-wide action to drive down methane emissions and flaring. In 2023, we achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016 – the third consecutive year we hit our target. As Shell transforms into a net-zero emissions energy business, we aim to take the lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).[A] Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our integrated power business. We plan to build our power business, including renewable power, in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA, and have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe. In line with this shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we will focus on select markets and segments. This includes selling more power to commercial customers, and less to retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect lower total growth of power sales to 2030, which has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of 20%. We will continue to transparently report our progress against our targets and ambitions every year. Driving towards a net-zero future We are investing $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. And in 2023, we invested $5.6 billion on low-carbon solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending. These investments include electric vehicle charging, biofuels, renewable power, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Our investments in new technologies are helping to reduce emissions for Shell and our customers. We aim to help scale new technologies to make them an affordable choice for our customers and are focusing our advocacy on key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition: policies that support national net-zero ambitions including carbon pricing, supplying the secure energy the world needs, driving changes in demand and growing low-carbon solutions. [A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021. ENDS Notes to Editors For full details of updates to our climate targets, ambitions and performance please read the full report, online here: www.shell.com/ets2024pdfShareholders will have an advisory vote on the Energy Transition Strategy at Shell’s 2024 AGM. Shell’s net carbon intensity is the average intensity, weighted by sales volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and reported using our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology. We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.Reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and our customers (Scope 3 emissions). While we can encourage the uptake of low-carbon products and solutions, we cannot control the final choices customers make. Support from governments and policymakers is essential to create the right conditions for changes in demand. In 2023, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon energy solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending. This includes the acquisition of Nature Energy, which makes Shell one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas in Europe. And our ongoing investment in Sprng Energy, one of India’s leading renewable power platforms, demonstrates our determination to invest in growing renewable capacity in areas that play to our strengths and add most value. We are also pioneering efforts to scale up low-carbon solutions, such as by starting construction in late 2022 of Holland Hydrogen 1 in Rotterdam, which is anticipated to become one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe.

It comes three years after we launched our Powering Progress strategy, and builds on our Capital Markets Day in June 2023 when we set out our plans to create more value with less emissions. Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of our strategy and is transforming our operations and energy products. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. As we work towards net zero, we are reducing emissions from our operations and energy products while becoming an increasingly successful organisation. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses: Integrated Gas, Upstream and Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions. In this publication, we set out pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors – transport and industry – based on where we believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the products they need through the transition. Helping reduce emissions for our customers We want to lead in the decarbonisation of transport using the strength of our brand, deep customer relationships and global reach. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and remain one of the world’s largest blenders and distributors of biofuels [A]. As the energy transition progresses, we expect to sell more low-carbon products and solutions, and less oil products including petrol and diesel. To measure our progress, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B]. Includes volumes from our joint venture RaízenCustomer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021. The world needs a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to maintain secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low-carbon solutions. We are growing our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business so that we can continue to provide a critical fuel in the energy transition. Our investments in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and renewable energy will help us produce LNG with lower carbon intensity in the future. Through our world-class trading business, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil, gas and LNG. As we work towards net zero, we are making clear choices about where we can add most value for our investors and customers. We expect renewable power will be critical for helping our commercial customers decarbonise, and plan to build our integrated power business in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe we have a competitive position there. Technologies of the future We are increasing our investments in research and development, and investing in the fuels of the future. We aim to scale up new technologies to create affordable options for our customers into the 2030s. We are building Holland Hydrogen 1, one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe, close to our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We are also investing in carbon capture and storage technology to reduce emissions from our own operations such as refineries and LNG plants, and, in the longer term, to help our industrial customers reduce their emissions too. I saw first-hand the potential of some of the exciting new technologies we are developing when I visited Oman in January 2024. We are part of a group exploring a project to produce green ammonia and liquefied synthetic gas from renewable hydrogen. These technologies are still in the early stages, but they could help to decarbonise industry and commercial road transport in the future. More value with less emissions At our Capital Markets Day, we said we would deliver more value with less emissions. We have made good progress in our first year under our new Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan. In 2023, we returned 42% of our cash flow from operations to our shareholders, the upper end of our 30-40% range through the cycle. We also reduced carbon emissions from our operations by 31% compared with 2016 levels, putting us well on the way towards our target of a 50% reduction by 2030 on a net basis. We achieved our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016. Transparency and shareholder support In 2021, 89% of our shareholders voted in support of our Energy Transition Strategy. Since then, we have published two progress reports, which our shareholders have also supported. Along with other Board members, I met with many of Shell's largest institutional shareholders following those votes. I appreciate their time and feedback and look forward to our next engagement in April 2024. The publication of our Energy Transition Strategy brings increased transparency, and better dialogue with our institutional investors. We heard that following Capital Markets Day, for example, some wanted us to be clearer about how we will deliver both more value and less emissions, and we are showing exactly that in this update. This year, we are again asking our shareholders to vote at our Annual General Meeting on our Energy Transition Strategy. As before, this vote is purely advisory, and not binding for our shareholders. The legal responsibility for approving or objecting to Shell's strategy lies with the Board and Executive Committee. We believe our strategy will transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, creating value for our shareholders, customers and wider society. We will offer shareholders an advisory vote at the 2024 Annual General Meeting based on the energy transition plans described in this publication and our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution asking them to support those plans. Sir Andrew Mackenzie Chair Chief Executive Officer's introduction This is our first update to the Energy Transition Strategy that we published in 2021. It is an opportunity to take stock of our progress, to reflect on what we have learned, and to look forward as we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. Over the past three years we have seen the critical importance of secure and affordable energy for economies and people's lives. As the world's population grows by an estimated 2 billion people by 2050, and the benefits of energy are extended to the hundreds of millions who do not have it today, demand for energy will only grow. At the same time, the world must achieve an orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy to achieve net-zero emissions. Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of global energy demand, with an even greater reliance in many developing countries. We support a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure and affordable energy supplies as the world moves to net zero. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in many countries and technologies in recent years, including the continued growth in demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), a critical fuel in the energy transition, and for low-carbon energy solutions such as solar and wind power, and electric vehicles. This progress reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy. Shell has an important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. There are exciting opportunities to use the strength of our innovation capabilities in the areas where we can have the greatest impact. Our purpose – to provide more and cleaner energy solutions – sets the direction for everything we do. Progress towards our targets Since we launched our Powering Progress strategy, we have made good progress against our climate targets, and learned where we have competitive strengths. By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. We achieved this by adapting our portfolio, including by repurposing refineries, and making changes to our operations such as powering some oil and gas platforms with renewable energy. We continue to be one of the leaders in reducing emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that can be released during oil, gas and LNG production. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we continued to keep our methane emissions intensity well below 0.2%. We made good progress towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations, compared with 2016 [A]. We also met our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016. More value, less emissions At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the ""more value"" part of our strategy. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers ""less emissions"". Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. In Integrated Gas, we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. In Upstream, we are reducing emissions from oil and gas production. In Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions, we are growing sales of low-carbon products and solutions such as biofuels, electric vehicle charging and renewable power, while investing in hydrogen and other fuels of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers through the energy transition. Our ability to raise and invest capital depends on delivering strong returns to shareholders, shaping the role that Shell can play on the journey to net zero. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets and ambitions. Reducing emissions from production We believe the world will continue to need oil and gas for many years -- produced with much lower emissions -- alongside cleaner energy such as advanced biofuels, renewable power and hydrogen. We expect LNG will play a critical role in the transition. It continues to provide a secure supply of energy in many European countries. It also offers flexibility to electricity grids as wind and solar power grow, and opportunities to lower carbon emissions from industries such as cement and steel by replacing coal. In the future, by powering our LNG plants with renewable electricity, and adding carbon capture and storage, we aim to lower the carbon intensity of our LNG plants. Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%), for example, the largest private-sector investment in the country's history, will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by more than one-third compared with the world’s best performing facilities. The Vito platform in the Gulf of Mexico (Shell interest 63.1%) is reducing emissions from oil and gas production. The platform started production in 2023 and is expected to produce around 80% less carbon dioxide emissions over its operating life, compared with the original design. We are using the same concept for two more platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, Whale (Shell interest 60%) and Sparta (Shell interest 51%). Supporting our customers as they decarbonise We aim to lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. The transport sector is a good example. We are building on our customer relationships and expertise to help drive the decarbonisation of passenger cars, heavy-duty trucks, planes and ships. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and stay a leader in biofuels including sustainable aviation fuels or renewable diesel made from waste. By repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, we are creating the low-carbon production hubs of the future. As we grow sales of low-carbon fuels we expect to reduce sales of oil products such as petrol and diesel. We have set a new ambition to measure our progress, to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B]. Our ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals for transport, which are among the most progressive in the world. Our focus on value has led to a strategic shift in our power business towards select markets and segments. One example is selling more power to commercial customers, including renewable power, and less to retail customers. As a result, we expect lower growth in sales of power overall. We have updated our net carbon intensity target to reflect that change, with a 15-20% reduction by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously. Towards net zero In total, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions in 2023, which was 23% of our capital spending. We are spending $10-15 billion on low-carbon solutions between 2023 and 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. With our focused approach, we believe our investments will have an important impact, allowing us to develop low-carbon solutions at increasingly affordable prices for our customers. Shell will provide the different kinds of energy the world needs. We will invest in producing LNG with lower carbon intensity, in reducing emissions from oil and gas production, and in providing cleaner energy solutions. As we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition. Wael Sawan Chief Executive Officer Subject to the completion of the sale of Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDCCustomer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021. Our Energy Transition Strategy 2024 Our key beliefs have informed our strategy, enabled our progress, and will allow us to deliver on our updated targets and ambitions. 1 Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. There needs to be a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies. 2 Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. 3 At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the ""more value"" part of our strategy. In our Energy Transition Strategy 2024, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers ""less emissions"". 4 By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016, and reduced our total methane emissions by 70%. 5 We believe liquefied natural gas (LNG) will play a critical role in the energy transition, replacing coal in heavy industry. It also has a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, helping to reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. LNG helps to provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewable generation is growing rapidly. 6 Investment in oil and gas will be needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline rate of the world’s oil and gas fields, which is 4-5% a year. 7 We expect rapid growth in electric vehicles, including electric trucks, and believe biofuels and natural gas will also play a role in reducing emissions from heavy-duty transport. To help drive the decarbonisation of transport, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards. 8 We believe carbon abatement technologies such as carbon capture and storage will be needed for the world to reach net-zero emissions. We believe once key regulations, technologies and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits will emerge. 9 Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe renewable energy will be an essential part of a net-zero world. In line with our strategic shift to prioritise value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. As a result, we expect lower growth of power sales overall. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously. 10 We are investing $10-15 billion in low-carbon energy solutions between 2023 and the end of 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition. Our journey towards net zero 2023 Invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions, of our total capital spending of $24.4 billion in 2023. This included the acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas in Europe.Our Timi platform in Malaysia, mainly powered by solar and wind energy, started production.

Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021. The energy system: our beliefs Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of the world's primary energy use. There is even greater reliance in many developing countries where security of supply and stable prices are critical to their development. The world's primary energy demand is just over 300 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d); with around 250 mboe/d from fossil fuels. Of this, 100 mboe/d is from oil, 80 mboe/d is from coal and 70 mboe/d is from gas. As demand for energy continues to grow, driven by rising populations and increased prosperity, the world must transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy in a balanced way to achieve net-zero emissions. The transition to net zero will not be linear, as different countries take different approaches and move at different paces. Public policy, developments in technology and infrastructure, and a functioning carbon market are essential to create the demand signals for the private sector to invest at scale. This will require collaboration between policymakers, customers and private organisations like Shell that have the financial strength, experience and capabilities to help build the new energy system. Developing our beliefs We have developed our beliefs through our engagements with customers, policymakers, scientists and thought leaders from around the world. We have used research from our technology programmes, along with work carried out by the International Energy Agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and several other external bodies. We have also drawn from the expertise in our own energy security scenarios, Sky 2050 and Archipelagos, which we published last year. Although our scenarios are not expressions of our strategy and are not our business plans, they help inform our beliefs. Our scenarios are quantified by our World Energy Models, which are supplemented with climate analysis done in conjunction with Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We will continue to challenge our own beliefs as technology, policy and customer preferences evolve. Increasing demand Since 2000, annual air mileage has tripled, passenger road mileage has doubled, and production of steel has more than doubled. We expect continued growth in the transport and industrial sectors, driven by rising populations and higher living standards in emerging and developing countries, where more than a quarter of the world's population still lack basic energy provisions. Oil demand has grown from 57 million barrels a day (mb/d) to almost 100 mb/d in the last 40 years, with occasional annual declines in recessions, and the notable decline caused by the Covid pandemic. In all cases, demand has rebounded. However, we believe growth in oil demand is set to slow in the second half of this decade, and could start falling in the 2030s because of increasing vehicle efficiency and growth in electric vehicles. Population, GDP, demand and consumption of energy 2000-2040 2000-2040 Population x1.5 GDP x3.4 Aviation (passenger km) x5.3 Passenger road (vehicle km) x3.1 Marine (tonne km) x2.2 Heavy industry (tonne steel equivalent) x2.6 Source: Shell analysis and IEA's Extended energy balances 2023). Demand for natural gas has also seen steady growth over the last 40 years, adding an average of about 60 billion cubic metres (bcm) of new demand a year. Demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) has grown much faster, from about 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in 1983 to more than 400 mtpa in 2023. Today, LNG makes up around 13% of the global gas market, a figure expected to exceed 20% by 2040. The global LNG market will continue growing at least through the 2030s, mostly driven by industrial decarbonisation in China, and strengthening demand in other Asian countries. LNG can help displace the use of coal in industry and power generation, and can top up supply in regions of declining domestic gas production such as Europe. The prospects for LNG demand are increasingly independent of pipeline natural gas because the fuel can be transported at short notice, and can also be used as a substitute for higher-carbon liquid fuels in shipping. Global demand for coal rose by 3.6% from 2013 to the end of 2023, when it reached a new high. This increase was fuelled by strong demand in developing economies. Coal demand increased by 35% in India and by 13% in China during this10-year period, due to rising demand for electricity and weak hydropower output. We believe replacing coal with natural gas, LNG and renewable power will be a key factor in reducing emissions.

Source: Shell analysis of IEA Extended Energy Balances (2023). Energy investment Significant investment will be required to keep supplying oil and gas while low-carbon alternatives are developed and made commercially available. This continued investment is needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline of the world's oil and gas fields, which is at 4% to 5% a year. Worldwide oil and gas production, outside North America, has been at around 120 mboe/d from 2013 until the end of 2023, despite cumulative oil and gas investment of more than $2 trillion over the same period. Current global investment in low- and zero-carbon energy is around $1.7 trillion a year. To reach net zero by 2050, scenarios suggest that $3-4 trillion of commercially viable investment in low-carbon energy is required each year.

Global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the energy system amounted to almost three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023. Tighter government policies will help to reduce carbon emissions at a rate consistent with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. Even without these policies, we expect that the global demand for fossil fuels would fall from today's level of around 80% to below 70% by 2040. If the world follows a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, the figure could go down to 50%. This will be driven by electrification and the scaling-up of renewable energy generation.

Source: Shell analysis and IEA’s Extended energy balances (2023). Industry Industry makes up 44% of the world's final energy use, with oil, gas and coal meeting almost 64% of this demand. Today, industry also uses substantial amounts of power generated by fossil fuels. The sector includes heavy industry, light industries such as manufacturing, mining and agriculture, and non-energy use feedstocks in chemicals. Heavy industry Heavy industry includes the energy-intensive production of steel and cement, which use high-temperature processes that can be hard and expensive to electrify. This sector represents 17% of final energy use, mainly in the form of coal, gas and electricity. Higher standards of living are built on the output of heavy industry. For example, the in-use stock per capita of steel in OECD countries ranges from 10-15 tonnes per person (t/p) compared with a world average of around 4 t/p [A]. Since 2000, OECD countries have seen a modest decline in energy demand as industrial output has plateaued. Innon-OECD countries, demand has nearly tripled, driven by industrialisation. Much of this increase in demand comes from China, which currently produces around half the world's steel and cement. The use of coal in heavy industry has fuelled much of the industrial growth in non-OECD countries over the last two decades, while OECD countries use far less coal and proportionally more gas and power. In non-OECD countries, gas and electricity have increased their market share against coal, and we expect this trend to continue. We believe natural gas and LNG will play an important role in replacing coal in high-temperature heavy industry applications. They can help address both local air emissions and wider climate considerations. More plentiful and affordable renewable electricity will also play a role in decarbonising this sector. Once electrification has taken place, gas will have a back-up role because many industrial processes require a high reliability of power supply. We also see potential for hydrogen in the long-term when it becomes cost competitive. Light industry Light industry constitutes around 17% of final energy use. Its energy requirements vary from fuel for heavy equipment to medium-level heat and electricity for manufacturing facilities. The energy mix for light industry includes coal, oil, gas, electricity and some commercial biomass. Many areas of light industry have already switched to electrification. We see this trend continuing with more action needed to increase efficiency. Supportive government policies are also needed to decarbonise the sector. Non-energy use Non-energy use is dominated by petroleum feedstocks and natural gas, and some coal in Asia. It represents about 10%of final energy use, but there are limited emissions as the feedstocks are transformed into material goods such as lubricants, plastics and fertilisers. Many of these products indirectly help reduce emissions when used in insulation in buildings or in plastics which reduce the weight of vehicles. We believe bio-feedstocks and recycling will grow in importance in this sector. Source: International Energy Agency. Iron and Steel Technology Roadmap reserved.

Transport sector The transport sector represents nearly 30% of final energy use, with oil products meeting more than 90% of this demand. The remainder is mostly met by LNG, compressed natural gas and biofuels. Global CO2 emissions from transport amount to around 8 gigatonnes (GT) a year, which is about one-seventh of global emissions. Oil products dominate transport because of their high energy density, convenience and cost competitiveness. In some markets, such as Europe and the USA, alternative transport fuels like ethanol are mandated. In Europe, where road transport fuel taxes are high, electric vehicles are increasingly cost competitive. However, in marine and aviation alternatives remain expensive. Bio-alternatives are at least twice the cost of oil products, and synthetic fuels manufactured from hydrogen can be up to eight times more expensive.

Source: Shell Scenario team interpretations of 2023 market data when Brent crude oil prices averaged $83/barrel Passenger road transport Today, there are around 1.3 billion cars on the road, consuming around 25 million barrels of oil per day (mb/d), which is a quarter of the world's oil production. Biofuels such as ethanol are used in some markets but currently amount to less than 5% of demand. We expect a rapid growth in electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids. Today there are around 40 million such vehicles on the roads, with up to 275 million expected by 2030. The availability of charging points will be critical for the growth in electric vehicles. The share of electric cars in new car sales has increased from less than 3% in 2018 to 18% in 2023. The most rapid growth is in China, the world's largest car market, followed by Europe and the USA. In China, there are a wide range of vehicles for sale at under $40,000, while in other markets electric vehicles generally sell at above this price before government subsidies are applied. Commercial road transport Commercial road transport, which includes 70 million trucks, uses 16 mb/d. We believe the shift of commercial road transport towards low-carbon solutions is less than a decade behind that of passenger cars. We expect that biofuels and renewable natural gas will keep playing a role in reducing emissions from trucks. In the long term, we expect electricity or hydrogen to become the main paths to decarbonisation, depending on advances in technology, government policy and customer preferences. Aviation Demand for aviation fuel has rebounded from its Covid lows and is now at about 7 mb/d. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from used cooking oils and other feedstocks is seen as a credible alternative to jet fuel. Today, SAF represents less than 0.1% of total demand, but we expect its market share to grow with support from governments. Around 11 markets have SAF targets, including Europe and Singapore. Some 25 airlines representing a combined 35% of global aviation emissions also have SAF targets. Government mandates are essential to increase demand for SAF because it costs consumers between two and four times more than conventional aviation fuel. There is limited evidence that passengers will voluntarily pay a premium to cover the extra cost. In the long term, advances in technology may create opportunities to use synthetic fuels such as e-kerosene, but further research and development is required. Shipping Shipping represents about 6 mb/d of oil demand. About 5% of shipping gross tonnage in operation today is fuelled by LNG, which can reduce emissions by up to 23% compared with conventional fuels. Of the new ships on order, about 25% of gross tonnage is being designed for LNG. A significant number of the ships in operation today already have dual fuel capabilities, giving them the flexibility to run on alternatives. We believe demand for LNG in shipping will grow, including for liquefied biomethane. Fuels such as methanol and ammonia could be options for shipping in the long term, but we see challenges with both of them. Buildings Residential and commercial buildings represent just under 30% of final energy use. This energy is used to heat the buildings and power electrical devices, and around two-thirds of it comes from low-carbon sources. The global building stock has become about 75% more efficient in the last 40 years due to improved building standards, better insulation, and more efficient appliances. Electrification has helped to decarbonise this sector and we see this continuing, with an increased use of electric heat pumps and cookers, reducing demand for natural gas in homes. Supportive policies will be key to continuing this trend. Information technology services, including data centres, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, are a rapidly growing part of the building sector. We believe global electricity demand in this area could double from 2023 to 2026. Power Power is the most rapidly decarbonising part of the energy system. More than 40% of electricity is now generated from renewables and nuclear. There has been rapid growth in wind and solar generation in the last 10 years, expanding from 3.5% of total power generation in 2013 to nearly 18% in 2023. Around 22% of final energy use was electrified by the end of 2023, up from around 18% in 2010. We think this trend is accelerating, aided by the adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps. Electrification of final energy use could reach 30-40% by 2040. We expect that wind and solar will continue to dominate power generation growth as governments rightly support their scale-up, which will also require significant expansion of national electricity grids. We see natural gas having a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, which helps reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. Natural gas also helps provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewables are growing rapidly, and its role is especially crucial in managing seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand. Carbon abatement We believe carbon abatement will be an important tool to reach net-zero emissions. Once key regulations and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits could emerge. Carbon credits may be used to compensate for emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate. The cost of carbon abatement can be split into three tranches. Abatement for less than $100 a tonne of CO2 includes efficiency measures in industry and buildings, changes in agriculture, forestry and other land use practices, and some switching from coal to gas or renewables in power generation. The middle tranche of abatement costs between $100 a tonne and $200 a tonne and includes the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in power generation and industry. The highest abatement costs are at more than $200 a tonne. These include parts of the transport and industry sectors, and directly capturing carbon from the atmosphere. Carbon removals are likely to become an important way to limit the long-term temperature rise. Both of Shell's energy security scenarios envisage the need for multi-billion tonne a year carbon removals, which will need to be financed by emitters purchasing carbon credits. Demand for carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market is expected to grow significantly. CCS also has the potential to make a meaningful reduction in CO2 emissions. While there are only around 50 million tonnes per annum (mpta) of CCS in operation today, there are around 300 mtpa of projects under consideration [A]. Many net-zero scenarios show the industry growing to more than 1,000 mtpa by the mid-2030s. Global CCS Institute, 2023. The Global Status of CCS: 2023. Australia Shell's strategy to 2030 Our strategy transforms Shell into a net-zero emissions business by 2050 by delivering more value with less emissions. It supports our purpose– to provide more and cleaner energy solutions Our beliefs inform our strategy. While the energy transition will move at different paces in different countries, we expect global growth in demand for oil will slow this decade, and is likely to start declining in the following decade. We also expect global demand for LNG will continue to grow at least through the 2030s. We believe the world needs a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low-carbon solutions. Our strategy supports a balanced transition by providing the oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the energy system of the future. As we implement our strategy, we are becoming a multi-energy business offering our customers more and cleaner energy solutions. We are reducing emissions from our operations, and helping our customers move to cost-competitive and cleaner energy. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses: Integrated Gas - Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity.Upstream - Cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable.Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions – Transforming our businesses to offer more low-carbon solutions while reducing sales of oil products.

Today, around 70% of our cash flow comes from our Integrated Gas and Upstream businesses, with the remaining 30% generated by our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses. The opposite is true for emissions. Around 75% of Shell's recorded emissions come from our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses, with the vast majority generated when our customers use our products. The remaining emissions are generated within Integrated Gas and Upstream, with a large proportion also coming from when our customers use our products. Across all our businesses, more than 90% of our emissions are reported as Scope 3. Shell will reduce emissions over time as our product mix evolves to meet changing customer demand. We will continue to produce LNG and oil with less emissions, while the mix of our sales will move more towards low-carbon solutions such as biofuels, renewable energy and hydrogen, and away from oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel into the 2030s.

We are developing new projects with lower carbon intensity by using renewable power and carbon abatement technology in the form of carbon capture and storage. Beyond our own production, we will continue to add scale and flexibility to our portfolio by buying LNG from others. Our LNG business will remain a key priority for Shell, meeting continued strong demand especially in Asia where we send most of our shipments today. As we grow our LNG business we will be targeting opportunities which have an internal rate of return of 11% or higher.

It continued to play a vital role in providing energy security in Europe in 2023. LNG is also a critical fuel in the energy transition. It is the lowest-carbon fossil fuel, producing around 50% less carbon emissions than coal when used to generate electricity, according to the International Energy Agency.

LNG is the lowest-carbon marine fuel available at scale today and offers significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions compared with conventional fuels. LNG also offers a long-term decarbonisation pathway through bio-LNG when the supply is scaled up. Shell has developed the world's largest LNG fuelling network of ports and bunker vessels on key trading routes, enabling more customers to choose LNG. To deliver the full GHG benefits of LNG, methane emissions must be minimised. We are working with partners, industry and universities to develop and implement technologies that reduce methane emissions associated with the use of LNG. Reducing methane emissions Methane emissions from natural gas and LNG contribute to global warming. Methane is a potent GHG and reducing emissions of methane is considered one of the most effective near-term actions to keep the more ambitious 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement within reach. As we grow our LNG business, we continue to make the reduction of methane emissions a priority. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 across all our operations. Through our more efficient new plants, and projects to reduce methane emissions from existing assets and our shipping fleet, we aim to deliver LNG with some of the lowest methane emissions in our industry. We are working with others to increase transparency on methane emissions, improve accuracy of reporting and drive reductions in methane emissions across our industry. We have been enhancing the accuracy of our reported emissions through the implementation of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework in our operated and non-operated assets. In 2023, Shell received UNEP's recognition for being on track to achieve OGMP 2.0's gold standard of reporting in its operated assets by the end of 2023 and non-operated assets by 2025. This would be the third consecutive year that Shell has achieved this highest standard. Working with others Shell is a signatory of the Oil and Gas Decarbonisation Charter launched at COP28, which focuses on driving down Scope 1 and 2, flaring and methane emissions. We led the development of the Methane Guiding Principles Coalition which brings together industry and civil society to drive reductions in methane emissions from the natural gas supply chain. Signatories of the Methane Guiding Principles are engaging with governments and industry in 20 countries to inform policies and regulations and disseminate best practice. Shell is a contributor to the OGMP 2.0 Methane Reporting Framework which is the only measurement -based international framework for methane emissions in the oil and gas sector. We are also a member of the Oil & Gas Climate Initiative which has launched the Aiming for Zero Methane Emissions by 2030 initiative. Role of LNG in the energy transition Supporting renewable energy: Using LNG for power generation offers flexibility and the ability to quickly ramp up or down. LNG will be essential for maintaining grid stability as the share of renewables increases. Reducing air pollution: Gas-fired power generation can help significantly reduce air pollution when compared to the emissions released by coal-fired plants. Industrial and high-temperature applications: Gas and LNG are important for sectors where electrification is challenging, such as high-temperature industrial processes. They provide the necessary energy intensity and reliability that renewables currently cannot match, helping industries like cement and steel on their decarbonisation journeys.

Energy security: While displacement of coal by renewables is expected to be dominant in the power sector, gas and LNG will also have an important role. They will continue to provide the flexibility electricity grids will need, and energy security in the coming decades in developed countries. Climate policy and emissions trading: In regions with stringent climate policies and emissions trading systems, such as the European Union, gas and LNG can help meet emissions targets by replacing more carbon-intensive fuels. Lower-carbon fuel for transport: In some of the slower-to-abate transport sectors, such as long-distance commercial road transport and marine, LNG can help with their decarbonisation journeys. It is a solution that is both available and more affordable today when compared with other low-carbon products, and reduces emissions when compared with oil-based products.

Advantaged Upstream Cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable We continue to focus on more value and less emissions, and expect that our oil production will remain stable through to 2030. The oil we are producing will increasingly come from our world-class deep-water business. Through innovative designs, our deep-water platforms are producing higher-margin and lower-carbon barrels. Maintaining oil production this decade Our oil production peaked in 2019, and by the end of 2023 had fallen by around 20%. We believe that continued investment will be needed to maintain oil supplies as existing fields naturally decline faster than reductions in demand. To keep production of crude oil and natural gas liquids stable to 2030 at 1.4 million barrels per day, we are focusing exploration on our existing positions and basins where hydrocarbons have been discovered already. This includes our high-margin deep-water positions. Across our upstream portfolio we are targeting an internal rate of return of 15% or higher. We do not anticipate any new frontier exploration entries after 2025 [A]. From the beginning of 2023 until the end of 2025, we will have started projects with a total peak production of more than 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Around 40% of these projects are in deep water. They include the US Gulf of Mexico, where we are the leading operator and have one of the lowest GHG intensities in the world for oil production. As we continue to meet the world's demand, we will build on the strengths of our current portfolio to continue to deliver lower-carbon barrels with higher margins. A frontier entry refers to Shell participating in new exploration activities (seismic activities, exploratory drilling) outside countries where hydrocarbons have been discovered already (by Shell or other companies).

Decarbonising our operations As a responsible energy producer, we are implementing carbon management plans and reducing carbon emissions from our assets. We are looking at ways to electrify our offshore oil facilities, and using wind and solar power to reduce operational emissions. We see carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a core technology to further capture emissions from our facilities, reusing our own depleted oil and gas fields where possible. We are working towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025, five years ahead of the World Bank's initiative [A]. Routine flaring burns gas that is not used or reinjected into wells, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC Demonstrating progress on eliminating routine flaring million tonnes of hydrocarbons flared (reduction 91%) 2016 1.1 2021 0.2 2022 0.1 2023 0.1 Differentiated Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions Transforming our businesses to offer morelow-carbon solutions while reducing salesof oil products We are reshaping our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses with a more focused geographic portfolio of products to deliver more value with less emissions. We aim to lead in the energy transition in areas where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. We are starting from a place of strength. Our global customer reach, and our supply and trading capabilities in low-carbon products, mean we are well placed to profitably deliver the low-carbon solutions people and businesses need. We are also able to identify changes in demand for products so that we can respond quickly. In the transport sector, for example, we see attractive growth opportunities in charging for electric vehicles and in biofuels for cars, trucks, planes and ships. We are strengthening these businesses to support our customers as they decarbonise and move from oil products to lower-carbon alternatives. As the energy transition evolves, we expect that growth in demand for oil products for transport will slow, and then decline. We are transforming our refinery portfolio and targeting value over volume in our marketing business. As a result, we will sell less oil products and more low-carbon products. Our strategy is to: Repurpose our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, providing cleaner molecules such as biofuels and hydrogen to help our customers decarbonise.Transform our marketing business by gradually reducing exposure to oil products used for transport, while changing our product mix by investing in areas such as electric vehicle charging, biofuels, and integrated power.Use technology and innovation to develop the business models and fuels of the future. The strength of our trading capabilities, coupled with our own production, will help us deliver affordable and low-carbon solutionsfor our customers. Focused on developing low-carbon solutions for today, tomorrow and the future Delivery today: Repurposing energy and chemical parks, Mobility and lubricant offeringsBuilding for tomorrow (2025+): Electric vehicle charging, low-carbon fuelsPreparing for the future (2030+): Hydrogen, Carbon removal and storageSupported and enabled by Integrated Power, trading and optimisation Delivering today Today, we are repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, which we are transforming into the low-carbon hubs of the future. As part of this process, we have completed the strategic review of our Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore with divestment as our preferred option. We are also high-grading our European energy and chemicals parks. This means retiring certain units and continuing with some divestments we have already announced. We are looking to strengthen our global retail and lubricants marketing businesses as the energy transition evolves, meeting the changing needs of our customers, and making value-driven choices region by region. That means growing our portfolio of low-carbon fuels and charging for electric vehicles in markets that meet our investment criteria such as China, Europe and the USA, and reducing our presence in others. As an example, we have signed an agreement to sell our shareholding in Shell Pakistan. Oil for lubricants and chemicals Most of the oil products sold by Shell are used in the transport sector. We estimate that 15-20% of the total oil products we sell are used for non-energy products such as lubricants and chemical products. Chemicals are used in many parts of modern life, from cosmetics to household goods. Lubricants are needed for virtually every machine and engine in operation. As these products are not combusted, their use does not cause Scope 3, Category 11 emissions. In 2023, Shell invested $2.3 billion in producing non-energy products including lubricants, chemicals, convenience retailing, agriculture and forestry, construction and road. We are upgrading our retail network, with expanded electric vehicle charging and convenience offers, in response to changing customer needs. In total, we plan to divest around 500 Shell-owned sites (including joint ventures) a year in 2024 and 2025. We are growing our premium lubricants portfolio to supply key energy transition sectors such as transformer oils used for offshore wind parks, and cooling fluids to support the development of electric vehicle car batteries. Supply, logistics and trading play a crucial role in ensuring we meet our customers' needs and generate strong returns. Our world-leading trading and optimisation business generates additional value by connecting supply and demand, for both conventional and low-carbon fuels across our global businesses. We will continue to grow our trading business in low-carbon molecules, carbon credits and power as the energy transition accelerates. Building for tomorrow (2025+) To build the businesses of tomorrow, we continue to strengthen our offer of low-carbon solutions where we see a significant increase in customer demand and supportive government policies. Between now and 2030, we are focusing on three areas where we have the potential to positively impact the energy transition by reducing the cost for our customers – electric vehicle charging, biofuels and integrated power. Electric vehicle charging We are growing our electric vehicle charging business to support customers who choose to change from a petrol or diesel vehicle to an electric one. We are focusing on offering our customers choices where we see increasing demand, such as in the fast-growing electric mobility markets of China and Europe. We aim to increase the number of public charge points we operate to around 200,000 by 2030, from around 54,000 today. Scaling our network of public EV charging points Thousands 2020 2021 2022 2023 2025 2030 Other 0.5 0.002 0.022 0.021 ~70 ~200 Asia 0.5 0.068 0.27 1.002 China 0 1.964 17.55 32.576 Europe 0 5.021 8.937 16.579 Americas 0 0.044 0.07 3.605 We are focusing on public charging, rather than home charging, because we believe it will be needed most by our customers. We have a major competitive advantage in terms of locations, as our global network of service stations is one of the largest in the world. We have other competitive advantages, such as our convenience retail offering which allows us to offer our customers coffee, food and other convenience items as they charge their cars. As we grow our business offering charging for electric vehicles, we expect an internal rate of return of 12% or higher. Biofuels We are expanding our world-leading biofuels business to meet growing customer demand and where we can use the strength of our supply and trading positions. Aviation and shipping remain some of the slower-to-decarbonise sectors and will require low-carbon molecular solutions such as biofuels and synthetic hydrogen-based fuels at scale in the future. Shell is already one of the world's largest energy traders and blenders of biofuels selling significantly more low-carbon fuels than we produce. We expect to continue to grow both our own production and sales of biofuels in the coming years. We are focusing on producing premium biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG). These fuels will help to reduce emissions in commercial road transport. To support our production of biofuels, we are investing in new feedstocks through investments and partnerships while using the strength of our trading business to expand sales beyond our production volumes. Through our Raízen joint venture in Brazil we are already the largest producer of second-generation ethanol and the leading sugar-cane ethanol producer globally. To support growing demand for biofuels this decade, we are developing more second-generation technologies. We are also developing technologies and feedstocks that aim to allow continued and sustainable growth in biofuels while minimising impacts on the environment and food supplies. Following the 2023 acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the largest producers of RNG in Europe, we have a strong position in RNG. We are actively looking for more opportunities to meet emerging demand for RNG, especially in north-west Europe. We expect to generate an internal rate of return of more than 12% from our new investments in low-carbon fuels. Integrated power We will continue to grow our integrated power business with selective investments in renewable power generation. We will also use the strength of our trading and optimisation capabilities to meet the growing need for flexible power storage solutions such as batteries. We already have a significant presence in battery and storage through both our ventures programme and investments in research and development. We are making disciplined choices to create value from our power portfolio, stepping back from activities that do not fit our strategy or that do not generate enough returns. We have exited renewable projects in Ireland and France, and sold our home energy businesses in the UK and Germany. We are focusing on selling power, including renewable power, to business customers. We are also using renewable power to decarbonise our own operations. Over time, we will also use our renewable power capacity to produce low-carbon molecules such as hydrogen. We expect returns from power generation to be in line with the market, at around 6-8% ungeared, with opportunities to create higher returns from areas such as trading and optimisation. Flexible power generation capacity demand is projected to grow significantly 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050 Gas 2.1 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.9 3.4 Hydrogen 0 0.1 0.3 0.5 0.7 1 Batteries 0.2 0.4 0.5 0.8 1.1 1.7 Other 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.5 [A] Gas includes both open-cycle and combined-cycle gas turbine power generation. Source: McKinsey Energy Solutions Global Energy Perspective 2023. Preparing for the future (2030+) This decade, we are also focusing on developing integrated energy hubs, select carbon capture and removal businesses, such as CCS, and fuels of the future, such as hydrogen, to prepare to meet our customers' needs after 2030. We plan to create integrated energy hubs around our energy and chemicals parks in North America and north-west Europe, and other locations where we see significant potential for high growth in demand in the future. These include Australia, Brazil, China and India. We will be focusing our investments in these hubs as we integrate our businesses and trading capabilities to deliver affordable low-cost solutions to our customers. We are researching the development of fuels such as liquefied synthetic gas (LSG), which is produced when renewable hydrogen is combined with captured carbon dioxide (CO2) to create natural gas, which is then liquefied. This low-carbon gas can be directly used in existing gas networks and infrastructure, including LNG plants. Carbon capture and removal We are developing technologies related to carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon removals, which are necessary to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. For the rest of this decade, we will direct most of our investments in CCS towards decarbonising our own operations. We are also looking to turn this into a profitable business for Shell by helping other companies decarbonise their operations in the future. However, in many countries CCS still lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates policy mechanisms to enable CCS, and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects. Direct air capture (DAC) technology can also play a key role in the energy transition. We are aiming to make it more affordable and scalable through several pilot projects. DAC extracts CO2 from the air to provide a carbon feedstock for synthetic products, or when coupled with transport and storage, to enable it to be stored underground. In combination with carbon capture and removal technologies, a functioning global carbon market will be a critical enabler of an accelerated energy transition. We are actively participating in carbon markets, and building and managing a diverse portfolio of high-quality carbon credits, including nature-based and non-nature based solutions, to help our customers decarbonise. Our transitions plans cover all our businesses Leading Integrated Gas Advantaged Upstream Differentiated Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions Focused decarbonisation pathways We have identified pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors, transport and industry. These two sectors make up more than 70% of global final energy demand and more than 55% of global carbon emissions today. Our pathways are based on where we believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the affordable productions they need though the transition.

Leading to our strategic decarbonisation areas for this decade Electric vehicle charging Biofuels infrastructure Integrated power positions Co2 capture and removal value chains Enabled by our strengths and competitive advantages Trading capabilities and infrastructure networks Technology and innovation Policy and advocacy More value with less emissions: our actions Putting our strategy into action across all our businesses Our beliefs about the energy transition inform our strategy to deliver more value with less emissions. Our strategy is based on the areas where Shell has unique competitive strengths, allowing us to be a successful business through the energy transition. Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity As we grow our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business by 20-30% by 2030, we will continue to reduce the carbon intensityof our operations. Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%,non-operated) will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by more than one-third compared with the world’s best performing facilities when it starts up. The commissioning process is expected to begin in 2024 and will continue into 2025. In Qatar, Shell is a partner in the North Field Expansion, the largest LNG project in the world. It comprises the North Field East (Shell interest 6.25%) and North Field South (Shell interest 9.375%) projects. By using carbon capture and storage, these projects will help provide LNG with a lower-carbon footprint to our customers. Shell's share of these projects will be around 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG when production starts later this decade. Shell is working with shipping companies to help decarbonise the marine sector. Parts of the marine sector uses LNG to power some of its ships, with the aim of switching to liquefied biomethane or liquefied e-methane, a hydrogen-based fuel, in the longer term. Artificial intelligence for LNG Artificial intelligence (AI) is helping us reduce carbon emissions at LNG plants by using information from sensors to calculate the most efficient settings for equipment. At one LNG facility, we estimate these technology developments are reducing carbon dioxide emissions by around 340,000 tonnes a year. We have used these automation and optimisation technologies to reduce emissions at multiple LNG facilities. Reducing methane emissions We continue to enhance the accuracy of our reported methane emissions and reduce emission sources across Shell-operated assets. By the end of 2023, around 80% of fugitive-emission sources at our operated oil, gas and LNG production facilities used leak detection and repair programmes to tackle leaks and monitor equipment. Shell works with others to share our learnings and drive industry-wide action on methane operations. We are a founding signatory of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework and have been implementing the framework in our operated and non-operated assets, engaging with our non-operated joint-venture partners to achieve improved accuracy or reporting beyond our operations. We test and use latest technologies to monitor our emissions. In 2023, we successfully completed a pilot with GHGSat, a pioneer in methane detection, to test satellite capabilities for monitoring methane emissions from offshore facilities. The aim is to use this technology more widely in the future. We have also been using drones and satellites to monitor the methane emitted during the production and processing of natural gas, and the export of LNG. This has helped us reduce wells maintenance periods and carefully control gas dryness during processing to limit venting. We have reduced vented methane emissions at our QGC business in Queensland by more than 2,800 tonnes since 2017.

Reducing operational emissions is a key factor in the development of new projects. Our Vito deep-water platform (Shell interest 63.1%) in the Gulf of Mexico is one of our newest platforms and has a peak production of 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. The platform is expected to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by around 80% over its operating life, compared with its original design. In addition to the reduced emissions, Vito also cost 70% less than the anticipated cost of the original design, an example of creating more value with less emissions. Vito's design is being replicated in two other deep-water platforms in the Gulf of Mexico: Whale and Sparta. The Shell-operated Whale project (Shell interest 60%) is expected to start production towards the end of 2024 and is expected to operate with less emissions than Vito. A final investment decision for the Sparta project (Shell interest 51%) was announced in December 2023, with production due to begin in 2028. Shell will use the experience of the Vito and Whale projects to enhance the design and energy efficiency capabilities of Sparta. We are reducing the carbon intensity of new projects elsewhere. Timi in Malaysia (Shell interest 75%) is our first wellhead platform to be powered by a solar and wind hybrid power system. This unmanned platform, which delivered its first gas in August 2023, is around 60% lighter than a conventional tender-assisted drilling wellhead platform, helping to reduce the emissions needed to develop the project. Reducing routine flaring We are working to reduce routine flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Our target is to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025 [A]. This commitment challenges us to move faster than the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. In 2023, around 10% of our greenhouse gas emissions from flaring occurred at facilities where there was no infrastructure to capture the gas, which is similar to the 2022 figure. Overall flaring decreased to 2.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 from 3 million tonnes of CO2e in 2022. Subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC. In Norway, Shell is the operator of the Ormen Lange gas field (Shell interest 17.8%). This is an underwater facility connected to Nyhamna, an onshore processing and export plant. The Ormen Lange is powered by renewable hydroelectricity provided by the Norwegian grid. This same source of renewable hydroelectricity provides around 93% of the energy needed for Nyhamna. We are installing further underwater compression units to increase gas recovery from the Ormen Lange field, which will also be powered by the same renewable hydroelectricity. Within our Upstream portfolio we have made divestments, including the sale of our interest in the Malampaya gas field in the Philippines in 2022 and our Permian business in the USA in 2021. These sales were strategic moves, which also resulted in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses: offering more low-carbon solutions We are reducing emissions associated with our refineries by transforming them into energy and chemicals parks. This transformation is under way at Norco in the USA, Scotford in Canada, Pernis in the Netherlands and Rheinland in Germany. In January 2024, we took a final investment decision to convert the hydrocracker of the Wesseling site at the Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland into a production unit for Group III base oils to produce high-quality engine and transmission oils. The repurposing of this refinery is a significant step towards serving our growing lubricant customer base with premium base oils, delivering more value with less emissions. The Wesseling site will stop processing crude oil into petrol,jet fuel and diesel by 2025. When it starts operations in the second half of this decade, the production unit will be highly electrified and is expected to cut Shell's Scope 1 and 2 emissions by around 620,000 tonnes a year. This is the latest development in the transformation of Rheinland, which includes investments in a 10-megawatt electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen and a biomethane liquefaction plant. Biofuels We are developing biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG) to help our customers decarbonise without having to change their cars, trucks, planes or ships. Shell is one of the world's largest traders and blenders of biofuels, meeting around 6% of global demand. In 2023, around 9.7 billion litres of biofuels went into our petrol and diesel worldwide, compared with 9.5 billion litres in 2022. Raízen, our joint venture in Brazil (Shell interest 44%), is one of the world's biggest bioethanol producers, delivering some of the lowest carbon intensity biofuels available today. The majority of the ethanol and cellulosic ethanol produced by Raízen is sold unblended to international customers in markets such as Europe, Japan and the USA. It is used in the transport, pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries, among others. Raízen produced around 3.12 billion litres of ethanol in 2023, up from around 3 billion in 2022. Raízen's Costa Pinto plant produced 30 million litres of second-generation ethanol made from inedible agricultural waste in 2023, up from 26 million in 2022. In 2023, the joint venture also commissioned the first of eight advanced biofuel plants which it aims to build in Brazil. In February 2023, we completed the nearly $2 billion acquisition of Nature Energy, making us one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas (RNG) in Europe. RNG, produced by turning organic material such as agricultural waste into renewable energy, is a low-carbon fuel that can power trucks and ships. With our partners, Nature Energy owns and operates 13 biogas plants in Denmark and one plant in the Netherlands. The biofuels plant at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands is expected to be one of Europe's biggest once operational in the latter half of the decade. It is expected to be capable of producing 820,000 tonnes of biofuels from waste each year. This facility will have the capacity to produce enough renewable diesel to avoid 2.8 million tonnes of carbon emissions a year. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could account for more than half of the plant's biofuels capacity, with the rest being renewable diesel. Shell can adjust this mix to meet changing customer demand. SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of global aviation fuel. Shell's investment will help increase SAF production, which is vital if aviation is to cut carbon emissions. To support our biofuel production capacity, we are also investing in new feedstocks for biofuels. In 2022, Shell acquired waste recycling company EcoOils which produces advanced biofuels feedstock at its facilities in Malaysia and Indonesia. This will enable the production and supply of low-carbon fuels like SAF to customers. We also invested in agroforestry company Investancia Group (Shell interest 30%) in 2022. Together, Shell and Investancia are using degraded cattle land in Paraguay to plant pongamia oil trees to grow sustainable feedstock to make biofuels. Lower-carbon race fuel for Scuderia Ferrari Shell has developed a race fuel containing 10% of second-generation bioethanol for Scuderia Ferrari to use in its Formula 1 racing cars. We use digital simulation to predict the combustion behaviour and performance of each fuel blend to significantly reduce the development time, and maximise performance and efficiency. The team is now working on a 100% sustainable race fuel, which includes several different sustainable fuel components, to meet requirements for the 2026 Formula 1 season. Electric vehicle charging Shell is well positioned to become a profitable leader in public charging for electric vehicles, meeting the growing demand from drivers who need to charge on the go. At the end of 2023, we had around 54,000 public charge points for electric vehicles at Shell forecourts, on streets and at locations such as supermarkets. This was up from 27,000 in 2022. We expect to have around 70,000 public charge points by 2025 and around 200,000 by 2030. Shell Recharge, our public charging network, currently operates in around 33 countries. We opened our largest electric vehicle charging station in the world in China, the world's largest market for EVs, in September 2023. The 258 fast-charging points at the Shell Recharge Shenzhen Airport EV Station serve thousands of drivers every day. The charging points are partially powered by rooftop solar panels with the capacity to generate 300,000 kilowatt hours of renewable electricity a year. The charging station, a joint venture between Shell and Chinese electric car manufacture BYD (Shell share 80%), has a utilisation rate of two-and-a-half-times the local average. China is one of the most important growth markets for our Mobility business. In March 2023, we completed the acquisition of Volta Inc. in the USA. We now operate one of the largest public electric vehicle charging networks in the country, with more than 3,000 charge points across 31 states and more than 3,400 additional charge points in development. Integrated power positions Our power business brings together our expertise in generation, trading and marketing. We are making selective investments in renewable generation, batteries and other grid-flexibility technologies, to provide low-carbon solutions to our commercial and industrial customers, and to decarbonise our own operations. We aim to profitably deliver more renewable power solutions, by growing our portfolio in select markets such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. At the end of 2023, we had around 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in operation, 4.1 GW under development and around 40 GW of potential capacity in our pipeline globally, including utility-scale solar and integrated wind-to-hydrogen projects. In 2023, Shell sold around 279 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, which is more than enough to meet the annual needs of Australia. In the USA, the solar, wind and battery company Savion, which we acquired in 2021, has started to develop new solar plants. Once operational, they will generate around 500 megawatts (MW) of renewable power. We are also investing in growing our renewable energy capacity elsewhere. In 2022, we acquired Sprng Energy in India and in 2023 we acquired Isemaren in Spain. We are also developing our own positions, such as our Pottendijk and Koegorspolder solar farms in the Netherlands. In 2023 in the Netherlands, the Hollandse Kust Noord offshore wind farm (Shell interest 79.9%), which has a generating capacity of 759 MW, became operational. Hollandse Kust Noord will eventually produce the equivalent of almost 3% of electricity demand in the Netherlands. Ecowende (Shell interest 60%), our joint venture with Eneco, announced plans to develop a 760 MW wind farm nearby called Hollandse Kust West. We are also developing utility-scale battery storage systems in select markets. In March 2023, we entered into a partnership to deliver a battery storage system in Australia. Shell will have access to 100% of the battery system's offtake over a 20-year period. Completion of the project is expected in late 2024. Hydrogen We continue to invest in the production of hydrogen, looking for ways to expand the technology and reduce costs so that it becomes an affordable and available low-carbon option for the future. To deliver the full low-carbon potential of hydrogen, we continue to learn about where emissions, including methane, can occur during production and use. We are also identifying opportunities to address them in collaboration with others. We see a role for hydrogen as a feedstock, for example to make synthetic fuels, and as an energy carrier across industry and transport. At the end of 2022, we started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 in the Netherlands, which will be one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe when it becomes operational in the second half of the decade. The 200 MW electrolyser will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm. Holland Hydrogen 1 will help to decarbonise the production of our petrol, diesel and aviation fuel at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam. In the longer term, the plant could also supply hydrogen to help reduce emissions in transport and industry. In Oman, we acquired a 35% interest in Green Energy Oman, which will produce hydrogen from seawater, powered by up to 25 GW of solar and wind energy. Shell is the lead operating partner. The project is expected to be operational by the early part of the next decade and aims to produce around 1.8 million tonnes of hydrogen a year at full capacity. As a founding member of the H2 Accelerate consortium, Shell continues to work with partners to enable the use of hydrogen to decarbonise long-haul road transport across Europe. The consortium is trying to develop a programme to make hydrogen a commercially viable fuel for the trucking sector. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) Shell continues to work with governments, customers and partners to unlock the potential of CCS to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. CCS technologies are necessary to meet the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. However, in many countries CCS lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates for policy mechanisms and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects. By the end of 2023, the Quest CCS facility at the Scotford upgrader in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 8.8 million tonnes of CO2 since it began operating in 2015. We are exploring the possibility of increasing CCS capacity at Scotford, initially by 750,000 tonnes a year [A]. Our Northern Lights CCS project (Shell interest 33.3%) in Norway signed contracts in 2023 to transport and safely store 1.2 million tonnes of CO2 a year. The CO2 will be shipped from two of Ørsted's biomass power plants in Denmark and a Yara ammonia and fertiliser plant in the Netherlands. It will then be stored 2,600 metres below the seabed in the North Sea. In Australia, the Gorgon CCS project (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron) reported it had stored more than 9 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent by the end of 2023. In addition to these significant emission reductions, Chevron has confirmed it had acquired and surrendered carbon credits to address historical injection shortfalls. The project started operating in 2019 and is the largest CCS operation in the world. Construction of Porthos, Europe's largest CCS facility, will begin at the port of Rotterdam in 2024. Shell will be the biggest customer, supplying 1 million tonnes of CO2 a year. The captured CO2 will be transported to empty gas fields under the North Sea around 20 kilometres off the Dutch coast. This will reduce the Netherlands' annual CO2 emissions by around 2% for 15 years from 2026. [A] Corrected on March 20, 2024 due to an editorial error. In 2023, Shell and Esso were jointly awarded three licences in the UK's first-ever carbon storage licensing round. The joint venture (Shell interest 50%) will evaluate three sites in the North Sea for the potential storage of CO2 captured and transported from industrial facilities in the UK. Also in 2023, Shell's CANSOLV® carbon capture technology won a bid for deployment at a CCS plant in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The plant will capture and permanently store 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 a year. Direct air capture Shell's research programmes have been developing technology to directly remove carbon from the atmosphere for several years. In 2023, we took the decision to build a direct air capture (DAC) demonstration unit at our technology research centre in Houston, Texas, USA. The aim of the project, which has a targeted start-up date of 2025, is to prove the viability of Shell's solid sorbent technology. The unit is being developed by a diverse team of Shell scientists, engineers and technical experts across the globe. Integrated energy hubs As part of our approach to the energy transition, we are developing integrated energy hubs to reduce our own emissions and those of the products we sell. At our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands, for example, we are integrating biofuels, hydrogen and CCS into our existing facilities. We have started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 which will help to decarbonise fuel production at the nearby energy and chemicals park once operational. The hydrogen plant will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm. Some of the emissions from the energy hub will be captured and stored under the North Sea by two CCS projects once they are in operation. These are Porthos, where we are the biggest customer, and Aramis, a joint venture. As the market develops, we will seek opportunities for future projects and use our customer relationships to meet increasing demand for low-carbon solutions.

They may be used by Shell and its customers to compensate emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate. We are clear that carbon credits need to have a robust carbon benefit and deliver a positive impact on ecosystems and communities. We work closely with local partners to ensure that the carbon credits projects we invest in are of a high quality. We select projects that are certified under credible and independent carbon credit standards. These include the Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard and the American Carbon Registry. We do this to ensure that the carbon credits are real and verifiable, and that issues such as permanence, additionality and leakage have been adequately considered. We also help develop and buy carbon credits generated by other nature-based projects and by technologies. We carefully source and screen the credits we purchase and retire from the market. In 2023, Shell's net carbon intensity (NCI) accounted for 20 million carbon credits, of which 4 million were linked to the sale of energy products. Of the 20 million tonnes of carbon credit retirements included in Shell's NCI metric for 2023, 85% were certified by Verra, 9% by the American Carbon registry, 6% by Gold Standard, and less than 1% via Australian Carbon Credit Units. Tracking SAF with blockchain We are using new technologies to power our Upstream and Downstream assets, improve our trading and supply operations, and deliver compelling new materials and molecules. Avelia, a business model developed in partnership with Accenture and American Express Global Business Travel, uses blockchain to help our customers securely and transparently track emissions reductions and the environmental attributes of the sustainable aviation fuel they acquire, tracing it from production through to delivery into aviation fuelling networks. Technology and innovation Built on more than 125 years of technological innovation, our company's future performance depends on the successful development, demonstration and commercial deployment of new technologies and new products. In 2023, research and development expenditure on projects that contributed to decarbonisation was around $628 million, up from around $440 million in 2022. The 2023 figure represents around 49% of our total expenditure on research and development, up from around 41% in 2022.

Our technology and innovation portfolio helps to deliver Shell's strategy by: Achieving more value with less emissions across our core businesses today. For example, the Just Add Water System, developed by Shell, uses a software system to reduce fuel costs for marine vessels and the GHG emissions they emit.Creating the low-carbon products and solutions of tomorrow, such as our CANSOLV® carbon capture technology which will be deployed on the world's largest CCS plant in Abu Dhabi.Exploring the transformative technologies of the future, such as renewable hydrogen, direct air capture, and heat and power storage solutions. The technologies and business models we are developing will shape the products and services we offer our customers in the transport and industry sectors. At our Zhuhai plant in China, which produces lubricants and greases, we have introduced a thermal energy storage system. This system replaces diesel fuel with renewable electricity to generate the process steam required for manufacturing lubricants. The storage system will optimise steam production and is expected to reduce the use of diesel by 300 tonnes and CO2 emissions by more than 900 tonnes a year. By demonstrating the benefits of this type of system on a Shell facility, we are in a position to encourage and support the decarbonisation of our customers. We invest in the latest energy technologies through our partnerships with start-ups and leading academic institutions. For example, we are working with Imperial College London in the UK to develop new technologies, with a particular focus on electric vehicles, lubricants, energy storage, CCS, and materials. Powering industry through investments Shell Ventures invests in start-ups and bigger companies that seek to electrify energy systems, decarbonise transport, gain data-based insights and provide innovative customer solutions. In 2023, we invested in a German company called Kraftblock, which has created energy storage systems to help the industry sector switch from fossil fuels to renewable energies. The technology also allows customers to recycle waste heat. Shell Ventures is a partner with Norwegian company Corvus Energy, a leading supplier of safe, innovative and reliable energy storage solutions for the maritime industry. The company's battery storage systems replace diesel and bunkering oil, thereby reducing emissions. The storage systems are used on vessels in Shell's operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Climate policy engagement Comprehensive, coherent and consistent policies are a crucial part of the journey to net zero. With the right policy and regulatory conditions, we can profitably increase our investments through the energy transition. We advocate robust policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers and reduce our own emissions. Our advocacy, directly to governments, and indirectly through industry associations and coalitions, is a key part of our strategy. Shell engages with governments, regulators and policymakers in different ways to help shape policy, legislation and regulation. Our public policy positions serve as a framework for our advocacy with governments, international organisations, industry associations, and other stakeholders, globally, regionally and within countries. In using the positions, we recognise that the pace of the energy transition will vary around the world. In the table below, we show how our advocacy focuses on four key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition and will support Shell's strategy. Policy and advocacy Advocacy Themes: A Achieving net-zero emissions Cross-sector policies that support the achievement of national net-zero ambitions through comprehensive policy frameworks and carbon pricing, and which seek to ensure a just transition B Supplying the secure energy the world needs Policies that support energy security, such as clear and predictable regulatory frameworks that enable the production of hydrocarbons with lower emissions C Driving changes in demand Policies that support changes in customer demand in transport and industry, such as vehicle standards, mandates for sustainable aviation fuel, and demand for low-carbon products D Growing low-carbon solutions Policies that encourage the development of low-carbon solutions, including incentives for biofuels, flexibility in feedstock choices, and effective regulatory frameworks for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS) Sector Policy Positions Advocacy Theme Cross cutting themes Translate targets into net-zero policy frameworks to achieve national net-zero emissions goals A Put a price on direct carbon emissions, integrate credits into carbon markets and support international cooperation A Regulatory frameworks that enable the production of hydrocarbons with lower emissions and the responsible management of end-of-project liabilities B Aim for near-zero methane emissions and an end to routine flaring as soon as possible and no later than 2030 B Recognise the role of gas in facilitating the energy transition and in securing stable and flexible energy supplies B Maintain liberalised power markets, enable uptake of power purchase agreements, and accelerate permitting and grid connections D Drive demand for low-carbon fuels through mandates and fuel standards, and allow flexibility in feedstock choice while meeting strong sustainability standards D Transport Road transport Establish policy frameworks for road transport that support the widespread adoption of low-emission vehicles and support investment in infrastructure through simplified and faster permitting and grid connections C Aviation Incentivise production of sustainable aviation fuel and set mandates to drive demand C Marine Establish a global carbon intensity standard for marine fuels to drive lower-carbon fuel uptake C Industry and services Encourage low-carbon energy use in industry through mandates and low-carbon product demand, and support investment in infrastructure networks and industrial hubs C Support production and demand for low-carbon hydrogen and accelerate infrastructure planning and investment D Carbon abatement and removal Recognise the role of carbon credits and ensure quality and integrity through standards and frameworks A Provide incentives for CCS, ensure efficient permitting and licensing of CCS infrastructure, and create regulatory frameworks that support storage and international transport and trading of CO2 D Read more about our policy positions on Shell.com/advocacy-and-political-activity Advocacy in action Advocating policies that encourage demand for and incentivise investment in low-carbon solutions is a key part of our engagement with governments and regulators. In the USA, for example, we advocate permits for projects to be granted faster and with fewer hurdles. Delays, caused in part by prolonged litigation, negatively impact the delivery of projects. We believe reform of the permit system will help to deliver new projects relating to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. To achieve this reform, we have constructively engaged in legislative negotiations in the House of Representatives and Senate to advance bipartisan legislative solutions. In the EU, Shell is advocating policies to enable commercial investments in the energy transition, notably the creation of demand for low-carbon solutions. We supported the Fit for 55 package, including binding targets for the use of renewable hydrogen and advanced biofuels. We supported policies to accelerate the electrification of road transport and frameworks that help the business case for carbon abatement and removal. In Brazil, we advocate the establishment of a national emissions trading system (ETS), which is a form of carbon pricing. We believe this would incentivise decarbonisation at the lowest cost, and support the long-term development of a global carbon market. The ETS is awaiting a final review by the Federal Senate, after which it is expected to be written into law. In the Asia-Pacific region, Shell is working with local and national governments to develop policy and regulatory frameworks for CCS. The creation of cross-border CCS hubs in the region could benefit multiple industries across the region. In 2024, Shell and ExxonMobil were selected to work with the Singapore government as lead developers for a cross-border CCS project that could store at least 2.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2030.

Targets, ambitions and performance Our target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 It includes net-zero emissions from our operations, as well as net-zero emissions from the end-use of all the energy products we sell. In the short and medium term, we have set climate targets for emissions that we are able to control, namely our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, methane emissions, and flaring. We have also set climate targets and ambitions for emissions that are outside our control. These include our ambition to reduce the Scope 3, Category 11 customer emissions from the use of our oil products, and our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of all the energy products we sell. Targets and ambitions Net-zero emissions by 2050 (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) Emissions from our own operations (Scope 1 and 2) Target Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 [A] under operational control (2016 reference year) Target Eliminating routine flaring from Upstream operations by 2025 [B] Target Maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 Emissions from the products we sell (Scope 3) Target Updated Net carbon intensity (NCI) Introducing a range of 15-20% for our target to reduce NCI by 2030 (2016 reference year) Ambition New Oil products ambition Reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, Scope 3 Category 11 [C] (2021 reference year) On a net basis.Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021. Reducing our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions In October 2021, we set a target to halve the emissions from our operations (Scope 1), plus the energy we buy to run them (Scope 2), by 2030 compared with 2016 levels on a net basis. To decarbonise our operations, we are focusing on: making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in new, low-carbon projects. We are also decommissioning plants, divesting assets, and reducing our production through the natural decline of existing oil and gas fields;improving the energy efficiency of our operations;transforming our remaining integrated refineries intolow-carbon energy and chemicals parks, which involves decommissioning plants;using more renewable electricity to power our operations; anddeveloping carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities. If required, we may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset any remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce, and compensate. The chart below shows our progress since 2016 in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and gives an indication of how we expect to achieve our target in 2030. The actions we will take to achieve our target will depend on the evolution of our asset portfolio and the continued development of technologies that reduce carbon emissions. We expect that on a net portfolio basis, new investments across our portfolio will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions between 2024 and 2030, but this increase will be outweighed by planned divestments and natural decline. Our investments in producing low-carbon energy such as biofuels will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell. Subsequent reductions in our emissions are reflected in the mechanisms outlined below and reflect an expected path to meeting our target in 2030. Working to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions Scope 1 and 2 emissions in million tonnes per annum [A], [B] Scope 1 Scope 2 Target 2016 72 11 2020 63 8 2021 60 8 2022 51 7 2023 50 7 Portfolio changes -1.4 Efficiency improvements -3.33 Energy and chemicals park transformation -0.58 Use of renewable power -1.73 Carbon capture and storage -6.3 Carbon credits [C] -1.6 2030 41 The 2016 baseline was not recalculated in 2023. The 2016 baseline may be recalculated in future years if an acquisition or a divestment has an impact of more than 10% on the total Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Operational control boundary.Including nature-based solutions. Our direct GHG emissions (Scope 1, operational control boundary) decreased from 51 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2022 to 50 million tonnes CO2e in 2023, driven by several factors including: divestments in 2022 (e.g. Deer Park and Mobile refinery, Tunisia Miskar concession, offshore Baram Delta Operations (BDO) PSC and Block SK307 PSC in the Philippines) and handover of operations in OML 11 in Nigeria in 2022; unplanned downtime (e.g. Deer Park Chemicals); reduced flaring from assets including Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo); reduction activities and purchase of renewable electricity. These decreases were partly offset by Shell Polymers Monaca having more units online in 2023 and higher emissions from our Pearl gas-to-liquids plant and our Prelude floating liquefied natural gas facility with increased production. Our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Methane emissions Methane emissions include those from unintentional leaks, venting and incomplete combustion, for example in flares and turbines. Our target to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% continued to be met in 2023. Shell's overall methane emissions intensity was at 0.05% for facilities with marketed gas and 0.001% for facilities without marketed gas. We believe our methane emissions are quantified according to industry best practice. This target covers all Shell-operated oil and gas assets in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses. By the end of 2023, we reduced our total methane emissions by 70% since 2016. In 2023, Shell's total methane emissions were 41 thousand tonnes compared with 40 thousand tonnes in 2022. The increase was due to venting (for example, the maintenance of our Prelude asset and operational issues in assets operated by Sarawak Shell Berhad) and an increase in reported emissions from integrated gas assets in Canada resulting from the adoption of enhanced source level measurements in line with OGMP reporting requirements. Methane emissions intensity [A], [D] 2023 2022 2021 2016 Methane emissions intensity - assets with marketed gas [B] % 0.05 % 0.05 % 0.06 % 0.10 % Methane emissions intensity - assets without marketed gas [C] % 0.001 % 0.01 % 0.01 % 0.03 % Methane emissions [D] thousand tonnes 41 40 55 138 Our target is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near zero methane emissions by 2030Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (incl. LNG and GTL assets), defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic metre (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm3. Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that do not market their gas (e.g. where gas is reinjected) defined as the total mass of methane emissions in tonnes per total mass of oil and condensate available for sale in tonnes.Total methane emissions for all assets under Shell operational control including Integrated Gas and Upstream and Downstream and Renewables Energy Solutions assets, quantified according to industry best practice. Routine flaring We are working to reduce flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Routine flaring of gas occurs during normal oil production when it is not possible to use the gas or reinject it into the well. In 2021, we brought forward our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations to 2025 [A] from 2030. This accelerates our commitment of 2015 to end routine flaring as a signatory to the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. Total routine flaring from our upstream oil and gas assets remained relatively stable in 2023 compared with 2022 at 0.1 million tonnes, having reduced from 1.1 million tonnes in 2016. Around 50% of total routine and non-routine flaring in our Integrated Gas and Upstream facilities in 2023 occurred in assets operated by the SPDC and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo). On January 16, 2024, Shell reached an agreement to sell SPDC to a consortium of five companies, subject to approvals by the Federal Government of Nigeria and other conditions. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC. Reducing net carbon intensity We have set targets to reduce the net carbon intensity (NCI) of the energy products we sell by 9-12% by 2024, 9-13% by 2025, 15-20% by 2030, and 100% by 2050. The intended use of the NCI metric is to track progress in reducing the overall carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell. Net carbon intensity measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell, compared with a 2016 baseline. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low and zero-carbon products- such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity. Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change. Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our power business. We plan to build our integrated power business, including renewable power, in places such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe that is where our strengths lie. In line with our shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. One example is our focus on commercial customers more than retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect growth in total power sales to 2030 will be lower than previously planned. This has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of a 20% reduction. Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a 45% reduction in net carbon intensity. The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing the sales of and demand for low-carbon energy. The chart on the next page illustrates how changes in the volume of products and services we sell could result in net carbon intensity reductions through to 2030. The change in our sales of these products and services will also reflect the development and adoption of new technologies and infrastructure, and the adoption of public policies designed to encourage the energy transition. In 2023, Shell's NCI was 74 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (gCO2e/MJ), a 2.6% decrease from the previous year and a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016, the base year. The decrease in Shell's NCI in 2023 was mainly achieved through a reduction in the average intensity of power sold and the use of carbon credits. The power intensity reduction was driven mainly by progress in grid decarbonisation in key markets such as the USA and Europe, and partly by increased sales of renewable power, including the retirement of Renewable Energy Certificates. Working to reduce our net carbon intensity (NCI) NCI in gCO2e/MJ [A] Actual Target 2016 79 2021 77 2022 76 2023 74 Hydrocarbon sales [B] -1.1 Power sales [C] -7.4 Grow power sales Low-carbon fuels sales [D] -0.8 Grow biofuels, develop hydrogen Carbon capture and storage [E] 0.4 Develop Carbon capture and storage Carbon credits [F] -0.6 High-quality carbon credits 2030 -15-20% Grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule.Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than those of oil products. Power sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and increasing sales of renewable power. Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen, which are low- and zero-carbon products. CCS reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source. Carbon credits such as nature-based solutions can be used to offset remaining carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and industries including cement and steel. We undertake external verification of our GHG emissions annually. Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from assets and activities under our operational control and emissions associated with the use of our energy products (Scope 3) included in our NCI have been verified to a level of limited assurance. Ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A] This level of ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals in the transport sector, among the most progressive in the world. Achieving this ambition will mean reducing sales of oil products, such as petrol and diesel, as we support customers as they move to electric mobility and lower-carbon fuels, including natural gas, LNG and biofuels. [A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards..

Shell supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets and ambitions with the 1.5°C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. For this reason, we have defined our net carbon intensity target using 1.5°C scenarios developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). We start with the complete set of 1.5°C scenarios [A] and then exclude scenarios which are too reliant on carbon removals or use of bioenergy before removing outliers. We then calculate an emissions intensity for each scenario which is comparable to our own net carbon intensity. Finally, we produce a 1.5°C pathway based on the reductions in emissions intensity over time. We have chosen to use a range instead of any individual scenario to better reflect the uncertainty of the energy transition. These are the AR6 scenarios which have a greater than 50% likelihood of limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (C1) or of returning warming to 1.5°C after a high overshoot (C2). Overshoot describes how much the global temperature in a scenario exceeds 1.5°C before returning. We believe that using this pathway to set our targets demonstrates that they are aligned with the more ambitious 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement. This is illustrated in the chart below.

To achieve net zero, we will reduce emissions from our own operations, change the mix of the energy products we sell and grow new carbon removal and abatement businesses. At the same time, we will work to help advance the critical factors required for the world to achieve net zero. Critical factors on the path to net zero The scale of the energy transition requires fundamental change in both supply and demand. It will take supportive government policies, advances in technology and investments by companies across all parts of the economy to achieve this. We advocate policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers, reduce our own emissions and help accelerate the energy transition. To help stimulate demand, we are investing in scaling up low-carbon solutions so that they become an affordable choice for our customers. Through partnerships with start-ups and leading academic institutions, we are also helping to develop the technologies of the future that will be critical to achieving net zero such as direct air capture, renewable hydrogen and heat and power storage solutions. Multi-energy business There remains significant uncertainty around the shape of the future energy system. As a result, we are developing a multi-energy portfolio that has the flexibility to respond to uncertainty, and that will allow us to remain a successful business and achieve net-zero emissions. By 2050, we expect that low-carbon products and solutions will have grown to become a material part of our portfolio. These solutions will be in the form of sustainable biofuels as well as liquid synthetic products, such as synthetic kerosene for aviation, that will be created through new technologies. At the same time, we will have focused our oil and gas businesses on projects with higher margins and lower carbon emissions, while pairing these projects with carbon capture and storage to further reduce emissions. In addition to our energy sales, a core part of our future business will be helping customers to decarbonise in the sectors where we have competitive advantages, including by capturing carbon and storing it, or by using the carbon to produce low-carbon products such as hydrogen. While the journey to net zero will include significant challenges, it also presents many opportunities. Through the actions we are taking today, we are positioning Shell to deliver more value with less emissions as we transform into a net-zero emissions energy business.

It also needs to be a just transition, which means a fairer distribution of the costs and benefits of the world's transition to a net-zero emissions energy system. Shell aims to contribute to a just and inclusive transition by making a positive economic and social impact on communities, workers and customers. Closing the energy access gap Today, around 675 million people do not have access to electricity and 2.3 billion lack access to clean cooking facilities, according to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Shell has pledged $200 million as part of a broader initiative to help people get access to energy in the near and medium term. The initiative aims to help millions of people in underserved communities in sub-Saharan Africa, India and South-east Asia get access to electricity and improved cooking conditions. Skills for the future As more jobs are created in renewable energy, it is important to provide workers with the opportunity to learn new skills. This requires robust dialogue and collaboration between governments, businesses and the workforce. We are aiming to help 15,000 people in the UK get jobs with a focus on the energy transition by 2035. Shell, together with its partners, is supporting the creation of two energy transition skills hubs in Scotland and one in Wales. The facilities, which are expected to open in 2024 and 2025, aim to provide people with skills for the future, such as in wind turbine maintenance and heat pump installation. In 2023, around 6,900 Shell employees – up from around 4,000 in 2022 – completed courses linked to the energy transition, including hydrogen production, carbon capture and storage, and greenhouse gas and energy management. We use our existing structures to expand social dialogue with employees, employee representative bodies, relevant local government agencies and communities to address the social aspects of the energy transition and to advance human rights and labour rights. Equal opportunities Equality of opportunity for groups that have been traditionally under-represented in energy is an important element of a just transition. Shell has set an ambition to become one of the most diverse and inclusive organisations in the world. This is embedded in our company strategy and applies to all parts of our business. We currently prioritise four areas: gender, race and ethnicity, LGBT+ and disability inclusion and enablement. Communities At our Pottendijk wind and solar power park in the Netherlands, which opened in 2023, we are sharing the proceeds from the renewable energy we generate. Over the next 16 years we expect to pay around $2 million into a community fund, which the municipality of Emmen will use as the community sees best. In Nigeria, Shell-funded investment company All On has agreed to invest $11 million in 25 mini-grid projects across the country. The company plans to supply affordable solar energy to communities that need it the most. Human rights, governments and industry Respecting human rights is an essential element of a just transition. Shell is committed to respecting human rights, as set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Read more about our approach at shell.com/justtransition Climate governance Our governance framework is designed to effectively deliver on the energy transition ambitions and targets of our Powering Progress strategy, which seeks to deliver more value with less emissions. The Board reviews our energy transition strategy periodically and oversees its implementation and delivery. In 2023, the Board considered climate-related matters throughout the year, including the assessment of climate-related risks and the effectiveness of corresponding risk management activities. The Board also challenged and endorsed business plans, including consideration of major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments. Our remuneration policies are designed to challenge and support the Executive Committee (EC) to reduce net carbon emissions, while generating shareholder value. Energy transition targets were part of the 2023 annual bonus scorecard (15% weighting), applicable to the majority of Shell's employees, as well as the 2023 Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards for senior executives (25% weighting) and the 2023 Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards for other employees (12.5% weighting), both vesting in 2026. Carbon management framework (CMF) We employ several processes across our organisation to ensure that management teams can effectively monitor and manage climate-related matters, including the delivery of Group carbon targets. These processes are supported by a combination of carbon management standards in projects, business growth forums where portfolio decisions are made, and capability development programmes. To drive delivery of carbon targets in the 2023 operating plan cycle, our net carbon intensity targets were translated into net absolute emissions budgets for each business. This enabled trade-offs within those budgets between emitting carbon and generating shareholder value. We also use carbon metrics (profitability per unit of carbon emitted) in decision-making when comparing different growth opportunities against each other. For the 2024 LTIP and PSP awards, ""Shell's journey in the energy transition"" performance condition retains the same weightings as for 2023. The extent to which awards will vest will be based on a holistic assessment of progress towards reducing emissions from our operations and supporting our customers to reduce their emissions. This will be based on our journey to net-zero targets for our own operations of: Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 under operational control on a net basis (2016 baseline); Eliminating routine flaring from upstream operations by 2025 [A]; andMaintaining methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieving near-zero methane emissions by 2030. It will also be based on progress in developments that support the energy transition to 2030 and beyond, such as the development of our power business (including renewables), lower-carbon LNG, biofuels, electric vehicle charging, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS). Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC. We will take into account progress towards achieving a 15-20% reduction in NCI by 2030 (2016 baseline) and a 15-20% reduction in customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 2030 (2021 baseline) [A]. We will also take into account Shell’s wider performance in accelerating the energy transition, for example by demonstrating leadership and advocacy in standard setting, alongside any other factors that are considered material. In 2024, we have adjusted the energy transition measure in our annual scorecard in light of our energy transition strategy update. By doing this, we continued to align to Shell’s strategic objective of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, supporting a balanced energy transition by responsibly delivering the oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the clean energy system of the future. The metric ""Shell's journey in the energy transition"" in the annual bonus scorecard represents: LNG volumes – equity liquefaction;Reducing operational emissions – operational actions to reduce emissions in support of our target to achieve a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emission by 2030, on a net basis; andSupporting customer decarbonisation – electric vehicle charge point roll-out. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes CO2e in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021. For further details see ""Governance of climate-related risks and opportunities"" in our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. Energy transition and advisory votes Shell offered its first Energy Transition Strategy for submission to a shareholder advisory vote at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. The vote offered shareholders an opportunity to engage with and support Shell's energy transition plans. Shell was one of the first companies in the world to introduce such a vote. In 2022 and 2023, Shell also offered an advisory vote on its progress in putting its energy transition plans into action in the previous year. Following engagements with institutional investors, we found that expectations around issues such as the inclusion of an absolute Scope 3 target influenced the voting decisions of many investors, rather than the progress report itself. As a result, going forward, the energy transition progress report will be part of the Annual Report and Accounts without an advisory vote, while the Energy Transition Strategy (this publication) will be updated and offered for an advisory vote at least every three years. Climate litigation Climate litigation Environmental activists continue to bring litigation against governments and companies for the effects of climate change on individuals and communities around the world. In the Netherlands, Shell is appealing a decision from the District Court of The Hague ordering us to reduce worldwide aggregate carbon emissions across Scope 1, 2 and 3 by net 45% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. The order states that reductions in Scope 2 and 3 emissions should be on a ""significant best efforts basis"". We are appealing the decision because we do not believe this is the right solution for the energy transition. By focusing on one company, and only on the supply of energy rather than the demand for it, we believe the ruling is ineffective and even counterproductive in addressing climate change. It is not clear how Shell can be ordered to reduce the emissions it does not control from customers, who are not under a similar legal obligation to reduce their emissions. The court is also asking Shell to reduce emissions significantly faster than the EU, which has one of the most ambitious pathways in the world. Shell believes that by working together, with effective government policies, the world can help shift consumer demand to low-carbon products and develop the infrastructure and technology needed for the energy transition, while maintaining a secure and affordable supply of energy. Shell's appeal will be heard by the Dutch Court of Appeal in April 2024. As we wait for the outcome of the appeal, Shell is taking active steps to comply with the ruling. Climate standards and benchmarks Climate initiatives and benchmarks play a role in supporting Shell's efforts in the energy transition. They promote an ongoing dialogue between interested parties and highlight areas of progress against externally established criteria. Doing business in a clear, open way is a commitment we work hard to keep, and we promote transparency where possible throughout our industry. We continue to learn as we work to provide relevant information to key stakeholders groups. In doing so we work with a number of stakeholders including regulators, auditors, investors and non-governmental organisations. Our strategy and progress in the energy transition, as well as our efforts to increase transparency, are recognised across environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks. Over the years, our performance scores have improved consistently, as evidenced by the assessment done by various external parties, including the most recent analysis from the Carbon Tracker Initiative [A] which highlights Shell’s good practices and key improvements in the financial related climate disclosures. ESG rating agencies [B] 2020 2021 2022 2023 MSCI A AA AA AA Sustainalytics 36.8 H 35.1 H 34.7 H 33.7 H ISS C C+ C+ C+ ISS The ISS ESG net zero alignment model evaluates whether companies have a credible decarbonisation strategy, including interim greenhouse gas emissions targets and substantiated commitments to achieving net zero by 2050. Shell is one of eight companies in the oil and gas sector that received a net zero overall alignment status of ""aligning"" in 2023. Flying Blind: In a Holding Pattern, Carbon Tracker Initiative, February 2024MSCI: A score of AA and AAA indicates the company is leading its industry in managing the most significant ESG risks and opportunities. Sustainalytics: A lower score indicates a lower risk of experiencing material financial impacts from ESG factors. ISS: Companies are rated on a 12-point scale from A+ (best) to D-(worst). Climate Initiatives Transition Pathway Initiative The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) is a global, asset-owner led initiative which assesses companies' preparedness for the transition to a low-carbon economy. TPI assess a companies' performance and progress in the energy transition against internationally agreed benchmark. TPI's assessment is divided into two parts: management quality and carbon performance. Management quality describes a company’s carbon management practices and governance, with a higher score indicating better performance. Carbon performance compares a company’s emissions pathway against different climate scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement. The carbon performance scores indicate whether a company's targets and plans are aligned in the short-term (2025), medium term (2035), and long-term (2050). In terms of management quality, in 2023, we received the highest score of four (strategic assessment) for the management of our greenhouse gas emissions, and of risks and opportunities related to the low-carbon transition. This exceeds the average score of 3.2 across all assessed companies in the oil and gas sector (90) In relation to carbon performance, although Shell's goal of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains unchanged, TPI no longer considers this target to be aligned with its 1.5°C benchmark. This is the result of TPI's approach to accounting for customer mitigation actions. Climate Action 100+ Climate Action 100+ is an investor-led initiative that drives corporate action on climate change, representing investors with assets of around $68 trillion. Its net zero company benchmark assesses companies against three high-level goals set by investors: emissions reduction, governance, and climate-related disclosures. It tracks business alignment with a net-zero emissions future and the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C. The disclosure framework evaluates the adequacy of corporate disclosure in relation to key actions companies can take to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and is assessed by the Transition Pathway Initiative. The latest results for Shell are shown below, based on publicly disclosed information as of May 29, 2023. Disclosure framework 2022 2023 Yes, meets all criteria 5 2 Partial, meets some criteria 3 7 No, does not meet any criteria 1 1 We are disappointed to see that our ratings have deteriorated in some areas in the latest assessment, which is largely due to annual updates to the methodology used. We have a strong governance and commitment to transparency so that investors can continue to assess our climate strategy and compare our progress with that of other companies. We will continue our engagement with CA100+ and TPI with the aim of ensuring that our current targets and disclosures are reflected in their benchmark and hope we can continue to improve the outcome in their assessment. Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Since 2017, Shell has supported the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD is a global initiative to get companies across all sectors to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. It recommends disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information aligned to its four core elements: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. Our climate-related financial disclosures are consistent with all the TCFD's Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures. Please refer to our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 for more details. Shell's disclosures related to recommendations by the TCFD are set out in the ""Our journey to achieving net zero"" section of the Annual Report.

These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as ""aim"", ""ambition"", ""anticipate"", ""believe"", ""could"", ""estimate"", ""expect"", ""goals"", ""intend"", ""may"", ""milestones"", ""objectives"", ""outlook"", ""plan"", ""probably"", ""project"", ""risks"", ""schedule"", ""seek"", ""should"", ""target"", ""will"" and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this report, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional conflicts, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (available at shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this report and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this report, March 14, 2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Shell's net carbon intensity Also, in this report we may refer to Shell's ""net carbon intensity"", which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell's ""net carbon intensity"" is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries. Shell's net-zero emissions target Shell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period.In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target. Forward-looking non-GAAP measures This report may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements. The contents of websites referred to in this report do not form part of this report. We may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this report that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website sec.gov. Additional information As used in this Report, ""accountable"" is intended to mean: required or expected to justify actions or decisions. The accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. ""Responsible"" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies. CO2 compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the atmosphere. CO2 compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels. Shell businesses focus first on emissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions. ""carbon neutral"" or ""CO2 compensated"" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO2 equivalent to the value of the remaining CO2e emissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage /end-of-life (if Lubricants or other non-energy product) of the product are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO2 compensation projects. Although these carbon credits have been generated in accordance with international carbon standards, the compensation may not be exact. CO2e( CO2 equivalent) refers to CO2, CH4, N2O. LEI Number: 21380068P1DRHMJ8KU70 Published: March 20, 2024 Classification: Additional Regulated Information required to be disclosed under the laws of the United Kingdom What is Shell plc's new ambition regarding emissions reduction by 2030?

The upgraded iteration boasts an all-new one-piece chassis, comprising a stronger, stiffer frame, a wide range of bodywork upgrades, and new and enhanced electronic componentry. The collective upgrades are the result of ongoing testing, development and refinement between the Polaris team and drivers over the course of the team's 2023 Championship season. Built upon the revolutionary RZR Pro R platform, the Gen 2 Pro R Factory simply builds on the stock vehicle's optimized fusion of power, strength, and control. It is the cornerstone of the entire Polaris Factory Racing operation, now poised to continue its dominance in 2024. ""Drawing upon key learnings from ongoing adjustments that we made throughout the 2023 season, our team in Minnesota and California worked succinctly to take the dominant RZR Pro R Factory, refine it and ultimately elevate it with the goal of doubling down and winning back-to-back championships,"" said Alex Scheuerell, Polaris Factory Racing Technical Director. ""This machine is the ultimate demonstration of Polaris engineering's expertise and commitment to pushing the boundaries of off-road performance."" While the RZR Pro R Factory features premium, race-enhanced parts, much of the main componentry on the vehicle remains completely stock, based on the revolutionary RZR Pro R platform. These stock parts include the ProStar Fury 2.0L engine, front and rear drive, transmission, power steering rack, wheel bearings, all CVT components, including belt, plus control arms, front and rear knuckles, ball joints, and trailing arms. This is a statement to the true power, strength, and control of the RZR Pro R that consumers can purchase straight off the showroom floor. The Gen 2 RZR Pro R Factory includes the following race modifications: All-New One-Piece Chassis – Using hard-fought lessons gathered from the inaugural season of racing, Polaris engineering set out to improve the strength and ergonomics of the chassis using the latest in CAD and FEA (Finite Element Analysis) technology. These efforts resulted in a weight-neutral frame that is stronger, stiffer, and roomier, with a safety cage that is over two times stronger than the stringent FIA requirements. These enhancements collectively improve ergonomics, comfort and vehicle stability.. After the design was complete, Polaris engineering utilized the expertise of Technique Inc., the sole provider of all NASCAR chassis, to manufacture the one-piece chromoly chassis using production weld fixtures.Upgraded Front and Rear Bumpers – Equipped with new removable front and rear bumpers manufactured by Technique Inc., these modifications offer increased vehicle protection to handle the unique challenges of North American desert racing, including ""nerfing,"" a racing term for bumping someone from behind while attempting to make a pass. In addition, the new vehicle features upgraded mounts for spare tire carriers, jack mounts, and tool kits, allowing the factory racers to confidently tackle each racecourse, knowing they can get out of tricky situations when needed.New Factory Muffler – The Gen 2 RZR Pro R Factory features an all-new lightweight Polaris-engineered race muffler to maximize power, limit volume, and refine the tone of the Prostar Fury 4 banger.Improved Cage Design – Based on driver feedback, Polaris engineered an all-new cage to provide additional strength and cockpit room for the drivers while also delivering a more aggressive look.Alcon High-Performance Brake System – With its race-proven technology and world-leading brake systems, Alcon USA will deliver its high-performance complete brake systems, including rotors, opposed-piston calipers, and dual master cylinders to the Polaris Factory Racing team. To allow drivers to push the machine further in the harshest conditions, these high-performance brake components are more durable and designed to resist fade caused by high temperatures and excessive use.DYNAMIX Suspension Control Module – Delivering maximum control through the roughest terrain, the Gen 2 RZR Pro R Factory features FOX® 3.0 Live Valve X2 Internal Bypass shocks with a new in-house race-tuned DYNAMIX DV Suspension Control Module. This new system is precisely calibrated for open desert racing, providing drivers with four new suspension modes, including Comfort, Baja Soft, Baja Medium, Baja Firm, allowing them to keep the vehicle firmly planted through corners and floating across the roughest whoop sections. These settings were specifically developed based on race driver feedback.MoTeC Components – The naturally aspirated four-cylinder stock ProStar Fury 2.0L remains at the heart of the RZR Pro R Factory. However, for GEN 2 Polaris partnered with MoTeC, the gold standard in off-road racing, to supply race-tuned electronic componentry, including ECU, electrical power distribution, and switch panels, which provide endless configuration options and proven durability when tackling wide-open desert racing.Carbon Fiber Prop Shaft – Upgraded from its previous steel design, the Gen 2 RZR Pro R Factory will feature an all-new aluminum and carbon fiber prop shaft to reduce weight and provide a higher torque capacity, and quicker acceleration.Increased Carbon Fiber Bodywork – In an effort to increase the vehicle's power to weight ratio and increase acceleration and overall speed, Polaris engineering focused on increasing carbon fiber throughout the vehicle's body panels.Increased Fuel System –To minimize the frequency of pit stops, the vehicles will be equipped with an upgraded ATL fuel cell with a range of up to 200 miles.Upgraded Upper Control Arms – Factory-developed, newly designed upper control arms are stronger and stiffer while allowing for more adjustability for improved handling.The inaugural 2023 season saw the Polaris Factory Racing team and the first-generation RZR Pro R Factory go undefeated at three SCORE series Baja races, capped off by a highly coveted Baja 1000 victory and a SCORE Pro UTV Open Class Championship for Brock Heger and Manufacturer's Championship for Polaris Factory Racing. In addition to its success in the SCORE series, the Polaris RZR Pro R Factory continued its success at the start of 2024 with Sebastian Loeb Racing's victory at the prestigious Dakar Rally and Brock Heger's victory at the King of the Hammers Desert Challenge. For the 2024 season, Polaris Factory Racing drivers Brock Heger, Cayden MacCachren, Max Eddy Jr., and Craig Scanlon will all be behind the wheel of a new Gen 2 RZR Pro R Factory machine. The Polaris Factory Racing team will debut the new generation race machine at this weekend's San Felipe 250 on March 20-24, followed by the Baja 500 May 29-June 2, Vegas to Reno August 14-17, the Baja 400 September 11-15, and the Baja 1000 November 12-17, 2024.

The technology combines symbolic semantics, execution models, and model checkers to provide comprehensive verification of Bitcoin transactions, minimizing security risks and vulnerabilities. The TrustBlock validator marks a significant advancement in Bitcoin transaction validation, offering improved security, reliability, and analytical capabilities. Positive None. Negative None. Cryptocurrency Technology Analyst The introduction of WiMi's TrustBlock validator represents a significant advancement in the realm of cryptocurrency transaction security. The integration of formal validation technology with symbolic semantics and execution models provides a more sophisticated and nuanced approach to transaction validation. This technology's ability to abstractly represent and analyze script code, coupled with a modular validator architecture, enhances the flexibility and robustness of the validation process.From a technical standpoint, the use of a model checker to systematically verify the correctness of Bitcoin scripting programs is a proactive measure to identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities. Moreover, the consideration of historical transaction records and account status in the validation process is a notable improvement over traditional methods, which often focus solely on the transaction at hand without the context of past interactions. This holistic approach could significantly reduce the incidence of fraudulent or erroneous transactions, thereby bolstering user confidence in digital currency platforms.Furthermore, the potential for this technology to be integrated into real-world applications such as exchanges and wallet applications is indicative of its practical utility. By enhancing the security infrastructure of these platforms, TrustBlock could play a pivotal role in fostering a more secure and reliable digital currency ecosystem, which is essential for mainstream adoption and the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies. Blockchain Development Expert The TrustBlock validator's modular design addresses a critical need for adaptability in the validation process. As the blockchain landscape continues to evolve, the ability to customize and configure validation modules to suit emerging applications and protocols is crucial. This modularization also facilitates the ongoing maintenance and upgrade of the validation system, allowing for a more agile response to new threats and vulnerabilities as they arise.Another aspect worth highlighting is the validator's potential impact on the development of decentralized applications (DApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi). By providing a more secure foundation for these applications, developers can focus on innovation and user experience, knowing that the underlying transactions are safeguarded by robust validation technology. This could accelerate the development and deployment of DApps, expanding the use cases for blockchain technology beyond simple value transfer to more complex financial instruments and services.The TrustBlock validator's emphasis on security and reliability aligns with the growing demand for institutional-grade infrastructure in the cryptocurrency space. As institutional investors and enterprises increasingly engage with digital assets, the need for rigorous and reliable transaction validation systems becomes more pronounced. WiMi's technology could therefore be a key enabler for the broader integration of cryptocurrencies into the financial ecosystem. Financial Market Analyst WiMi's announcement of the TrustBlock validator could have a ripple effect on the financial markets, particularly within the sectors related to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Enhanced security and reliability in Bitcoin transactions are likely to increase investor confidence, which might translate into greater investment in the cryptocurrency market. This, in turn, could impact the valuation of companies like WiMi, as well as the broader blockchain industry.However, it is important to consider the adoption curve for such technologies. While the benefits are clear, integration into existing systems and platforms can be a complex and time-consuming process. The market's response will depend on how quickly and effectively WiMi can commercialize this technology and form partnerships with key players in the digital currency space.Moreover, the potential for improved transaction security to foster a healthier digital currency market aligns with regulatory trends pushing for greater consumer protection in the financial industry. As regulators worldwide scrutinize the cryptocurrency market, technologies that enhance security and compliance may become increasingly valuable, potentially positioning WiMi as a leading player in this niche market. 03/20/2024 - 11:40 AM BEIJING, March 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- WiMi Hologram Cloud Inc. (NASDAQ: WIMI) (""WiMi"" or the ""Company""), a leading global Hologram Augmented Reality (""AR"") Technology provider, today announced a new technology aiming at improving the accuracy and reliability of Bitcoin transaction validation to better meet the growing market demand. The WiMi development team had in-depth research and analysis of existing technologies for Bitcoin transaction validation, gained a deep understanding of their principles and operation mechanisms, and combined them with the latest advances in formal validation technology. By drawing on the theories and methods from symbol semantics, execution models, model checkers, and other related fields, WiMi develooped the technical framework of the Bitcoin TrustBlock validator. The Bitcoin TrustBlock validator aims to harden the security of decentralized applications (DApps). This technology will bring unprecedented security and reliability to the cryptocurrency community, advancing the development of DeFi and other areas. The TrustBlock validator is a Bitcoin-based automated validation technology designed to review and validate scripting programs used by Bitcoin exchanges for security and correctness. The technology combines symbolic semantics and execution models, utilizing a model checker and modular validator to enable comprehensive verification of script code, thereby minimizing potential security risks and vulnerabilities. The TrustBlock validator employs symbolic semantics and execution models to understand and interpret scripted programs in Bitcoin transactions. With symbolic semantics, the validator can abstractly represent script code and transform it into a symbolic execution for subsequent analysis and verification. The execution model, on the other hand, defines how script programs are executed in the Bitcoin network, including the inputs and outputs of scripts, the order of execution, etc. In addition, the TrustBlock Validator includes a model checker for comprehensive formal validation of Bitcoin transactions. The model checker checks whether the scripting program in a transaction is secure and correct. By running the model checker, potential problems in transactions can be found and fixed promptly, thus improving the security and reliability of transactions. Utilizing a modular validator architecture, the TrustBlock validator breaks down the validation process into multiple independent modules, each of which is responsible for validating specific aspects. This modularized design makes the validator more flexible and extensible, allowing it to flexibly combine and configure different validation modules as needed to adapt to different application scenarios and requirements. Unlike traditional Bitcoin transaction validation methods, the TrustBlock validator can more accurately determine the legitimacy and validity of transactions by taking into account historical transaction records and account status. The TrustBlock validator has powerful analytical capabilities to minimize errors and risks in the validation process. Through in-depth analysis of the various parameters and conditions involved in a transaction, the validator can identify potential security loopholes and errors, to make timely repairs and improvements. WiMi's TrustBlock verification appliance has several outstanding advantages over traditional methods of verifying Bitcoin transactions. First, it employs the latest formal verification technology to verify complex protocols and decentralized applications, providing users with a broader range of applications. Second, the TrustBlock validator takes into account prior information in the ledger during the validation process, which improves the accuracy and reliability of the validation. The technology also features enhanced analytics to minimize errors and risks in the validation process. The application port can be used to connect the Bitcoin TrustBlock validator to real-world applications, such as exchanges, wallet applications, or other digital currency service providers' platforms. This interface can be used to apply the verification of the TrustBlock validator to the actual Bitcoin transaction process to enhance the security and reliability of transactions. The Bitcoin TrustBlock validator marks a breakthrough in the field of Bitcoin transaction validation. Through a combination of technical tools such as symbolic semantics and execution models, model checkers, consideration of prior information in the ledger, and enhanced analytics, the TrustBlock validator enables comprehensive validation of Bitcoin transactions, providing a strong guarantee of transaction security and reliability. The technology not only advances the security and reliability of Bitcoin transactions, but also provides new impetus for the development of decentralized applications and blockchain technology. WiMi's TrustBlock validator will bring the digital currency community a safer and more reliable trading environment, increasing the trust and reliance of digital currency users and investors. By integrating the application port into real-world application scenarios such as exchange platforms, wallet applications, digital currency service providers' platforms, and smart contract platforms, the TrustBlock validator can provide users with a more secure and reliable digital currency service, and promote healthy development of the digital currency market.

Positive Acquisition of THE SOCIAL PROXY expands XTL's IP portfolio for AI & BI Applications. Transaction includes issuing ADS's representing 44.6% of XTL's share capital and additional warrants. Private placement of $1.5 million secured to support the acquisition. Social Proxy to operate as a fully-owned subsidiary, with its shareholders appointing two representatives to XTL's board of directors. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The proposed acquisition of The Social Proxy by XTL Biopharmaceuticals represents a strategic move to diversify and bolster XTL's asset portfolio with technology that has the potential to tap into the rapidly growing AI and BI applications market. This investment indicates XTL's intent to capitalize on the increasing demand for ethical data extraction and proxy services, which are becoming more critical as businesses seek to leverage big data for competitive advantage.From a market research perspective, the integration of The Social Proxy's technology could provide XTL with a competitive edge in AI Web Data, a niche but expanding sector. The decision to acquire a majority stake and integrate Social Proxy's board members suggests a long-term commitment to this new direction. However, investors should monitor the company's ability to integrate this technology and realize synergies, as well as the actual performance against the financial milestones tied to the additional warrants issued. Financial Analyst XTL's investment structure in The Social Proxy, involving a mix of equity and warrants, reflects a financing approach that aligns the interests of both XTL and Social Proxy's shareholders. The issuance of ADS's representing 44.6% of XTL's post-transaction share capital, combined with the payment of US$430,000, suggests a valuation of Social Proxy that investors should examine closely. The subsequent private placement of US$1.5 million, with unit warrants exercisable at US$1.20, further dilutes current shareholders but provides additional capital that is necessary to support the transaction and future growth.Investors should be aware of the implications of shareholder dilution and the potential impact on earnings per share. Furthermore, the involvement of a significant shareholder and director in the private placement raises questions about potential conflicts of interest, which should be scrutinized alongside the transaction's terms. Legal Expert The completion of the acquisition is contingent upon several legal and regulatory hurdles, including shareholder approval, due diligence and the negotiation of definitive agreements. These steps are standard in such transactions and are designed to protect the interests of all parties involved, including minority shareholders. The requirement for shareholder approval, particularly given the involvement of a major shareholder in the financing, is an important governance step to ensure transparency and fairness.Investors should pay attention to the outcomes of these processes, as they can significantly affect the timeline and final terms of the deal. The addition of Social Proxy's representatives to XTL's board could also introduce new dynamics in governance and decision-making that stakeholders should consider. 03/20/2024 - 10:15 AM expands its IP portfolio to AI Web Data The Social Proxy is a web data AI companydeveloping and powering an IP based platform for AI & BI Applications at scale Secured $1.5 Million in a Private Placement RAMAT GAN, ISRAEL, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- XTL Biopharmaceuticals Ltd.

The company is focusing on capital investments in the U.S. Gulf Coast strategy to provide sustainable energy sources and support local communities.,"2024 Enbridge Day: 'North America Has a Critical Role To Play' in Global Energy Transition, Says CEO Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Enbridge announces suite of USGC export investments at annual investor community conference in NYC. The company is focusing on capital investments in the U.S. Gulf Coast strategy to provide sustainable energy sources and support local communities. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Market Analyst The acquisition of marine docks and adjacent land by Enbridge near the Enbridge Ingleside Energy Center (EIEC) represents a strategic expansion in a key geographic location. The EIEC's status as the largest oil storage and export terminal by volume in the U.S. is significant in the context of North American energy infrastructure. This move could potentially increase Enbridge's export capacity, allowing the company to capitalize on global energy demand, particularly as markets continue to evolve in the face of energy transition pressures.From an energy market perspective, the transaction may influence the dynamics of crude oil supply chains and could affect pricing differentials, especially in the Gulf Coast region. It is important to monitor how this increased capacity aligns with the company's commitments to sustainability and how it might play into the broader market's shift towards lower-carbon energy sources. Financial Analyst Enbridge's announcement of new capital investments is a forward-looking move that signals confidence in the long-term demand for energy, despite the current global push for emission reductions. The financial implications for stakeholders include the potential for accretive growth, which refers to investments that are expected to add to earnings per share. In evaluating the impact on Enbridge's financials, one would consider the cost of acquisition and the anticipated returns in terms of increased throughput and potential tolling revenue.Analyzing the company's capital allocation strategy is essential, particularly in assessing whether these investments align with shareholder interests and the company's debt profile. Additionally, it will be important to look at how these investments are financed and their impact on Enbridge's balance sheet. Sustainability Analyst Enbridge's emphasis on supplying sustainable conventional and lower-carbon energy sources is a critical aspect of their strategy, especially in light of global emission targets. The investments in the U.S. Gulf Coast strategy need to be assessed not just for their economic return, but also for their environmental impact. Stakeholders are increasingly valuing companies that contribute positively to environmental goals.It is important to scrutinize the balance Enbridge strikes between expanding fossil fuel infrastructure and advancing lower-carbon initiatives. The long-term sustainability of these investments should be evaluated in the context of potential regulatory changes and the increasing competitiveness of renewable energy sources. 03/20/2024 - 12:45 PM Enbridge announces suite of USGC export investments at annual investor community conference in NYCNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 20, 2024 / EnbridgeWith enviable scale, scope, connectivity and diversity, Enbridge is prepared to play a bigger role in the global energy transition.On March 6, during our 2024 Enbridge Day investor community conference in New York, we announced a suite of accretive new capital investments focused on our U.S. Gulf Coast strategy.By supplying abundant, cost-competitive and sustainable conventional and lower-carbon energy sources, we're delivering the energy people need while also supporting local communities and helping nations meet global emission targets.""Global demand for affordable, reliable and sustainable energy continues to rise-and North America has a critical role to play,"" noted Greg Ebel, Enbridge's President and CEO.""At Enbridge, we're building out our integrated infrastructure super systems to enable the continued delivery of energy in a planet-friendly way, everywhere people need it.""The March 6th USGC announcements included:The acquisition of two marine docks and a parcel of land adjacent to our Enbridge Ingleside Energy Center (EIEC) near Corpus Christi, TX, already the largest oil storage and export terminal by volume in the U.S., from Flint Hills Resources for about US$0.2 billion.Forming, with Shell Pipeline, the Oceanus Pipeline Company, LLC to develop offshore gas and oil pipelines serving Shell and Equinor's offshore Sparta development off the Louisiana coast, at a capital cost of about US$0.2 billion.A planned expansion of the Gray Oak Pipeline, which connects to market centers in the Corpus Christi and Houston regions, of about 120,000 barrels per day, pending a successful open season.Sanctioning 2.5 million barrels of additional storage at EIEC, bringing the facility's overall storage capacity to about 20 million barrels by 2025.""These accretive investments provide near-term growth in the U.S. Gulf Coast and set the stage for the future expansion through high-quality partnerships and embedded organic opportunities,"" said Mr. Ebel.

The assessment, which is free to take and available now, is the first of its kind in the financial services industry and was built exclusively for financial institutions. The foundation of the tool is the Alkami Digital Sales & Service Maturity Model, which was developed based on recently released research conducted across 215 U.S. financial institutions with at least $200 million in assets. To assess digital maturity, the tool asks financial institutions to answer five questions that were found to be the most determinant in the research in measuring digital maturity across banks and credit unions. After completing the online assessment, financial institutions are categorized into one of four segments on Alkami's digital maturity spectrum: Patiently Exploring, Innovation-Ready, Digital-Forward, and Data-First. They are also provided with actionable guidance on a path forward and where to focus business operations based on their segment. For example, financial institutions found to be 'Innovation-Ready' are encouraged to broaden their digital banking user experience to include speed, enhanced capabilities and personalization. Incorporating data as a strategy and focusing on streamlining the digital account opening experience will better position them to serve those account holders. ""We are committed to listening to our clients, and the Digital Sales & Service Maturity Model Assessment is a direct response to their feedback. Financial institutions today want to understand where they are in their digital journey and where they should focus their time and budget, but before now, no resources existed in the market to quickly answer these questions,"" said Allison Cerra, chief marketing officer at Alkami.

For me, inclusion is a central point of focus every day, and my team continues to work on blending it into everything we do at Gen. Inclusion is (and should always be) woven into our culture. And though we're a global company, it doesn't just come naturally. We still work at it. Strategize around it, purposefully.Our four-pillar DEI strategy is at the heart of our mission. These include:Measurement and accountabilityFostering an inclusive environmentDiversifying our workforceDevelopment and retentionThese efforts drive our mission to attract, retain and develop talent by providing meaningful opportunities within our diverse teams. So far, we've found success in more inclusive and diverse teams - success in innovation, creativity and, more importantly, wellness (wellness being physical, emotional and financial).Fiscal Year 2023 ended on a good note. But we've still got work to do. Here is how Gen netted out in FY23:30% Of our leadership team are women32% Of our global team members are women15% Of our team members identified as underrepresented minorities6% Of our U.S. team were BlackI'm glad to say that our efforts haven't gone unnoticed - Newsweek recently recognized Gen asOne of America's Greatest Workplaces for WomenAnd one of America's Greatest Workplaces for DiversityThat's something we appreciate and celebrate.As we continue to grow and build #TeamGen, we'll continue to evolve our representation strategy, too (I look forward to sharing more on that). Below I'll dig into a couple of things happening internally and externally, how we're fostering a culture of belonging and why I think Gen is truly a great workplace.Sharing Common Differences: Internal WorkingsOur employee resource groups - which we call ""Communities@Gen"" - help us bring our global team members and allies together for events and initiatives, learning journeys, mentoring, volunteering opportunities and more. It's a way for us to feel close to each other, even when we're far. Share commonalities and differences with people who are like ourselves and those who are eager to learn. It's how we make new friends. Introduce cultural understanding. How we have fun. It's a chance for us to be ourselves (which can be a breath of fresh air in the corporate world).Beginning in FY24, each community receives a dedicated budget from our Giving@Gen program to donate to an eligible cause of their choice. Communities also partner with Giving@Gen throughout the year to offer volunteering and giving opportunities for all employees, such as raising funds for organizations like SAATHI, Outhouse, Sapling and many, many more.Amplifying Our Impact: External EffortsWe work with several high-impact nonprofits to accelerate our inclusion work. With our nonprofit partner, Disability:IN, Gen held an all-company event during World Autism Month, highlighting the challenges of sensory overload for neurodiverse individuals and helped people understand how they can better support themselves or team members who may have a disability.As part of our efforts to build a pipeline of diverse talent, Gen continues to partner with programs that empower women in tech. Czechitas, based in the Czech Republic, operates a diverse range of programs to help train and upskill professional women looking to enter tech careers. The nonprofit also helps connect its graduates to partner companies hiring in the IT field. In 2023, our partnership supported eight events, including Czechitas' Digital Academies, educating more than 227 people.Women4Cyber seeks to close the gender gap in cybersecurity through awareness and mentoring programs for women. Our contribution of $150,000 per year for three years will add content to Women4Cyber's Academy, offer mentorships with Gen employees and contribute to the expansion of new chapters.We also collaborate with nonprofits to provide Cyber Safety resources to higher-risk and diverse communities. As an example, Gen partners with The Trevor Project, the leading suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ+ young people. Together we created the Guide to Online Safety for LGBTQ+ Young People. This free digital resource helps queer youth navigate the digital world.As a global brand providing safety for the first digital generation, we get how incorporating diverse voices gets us further, faster. And I'm personally excited to lead the charge on the DE&I front and see how Gen continues to grow in the coming years.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Gen on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: GenWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/genEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: GenView the original press release on accesswire.com What is Gen's four-pillar DEI strategy?

Cboe Introduces Enhanced Margin Treatment for Index Options Overwriting Strategies,2024-03-20T14:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Cboe Global Markets introduces enhanced margin treatment for cash-settled index options, aiming to provide greater capital efficiencies for traders. The rule change allows traders to use cash-settled index options as a trading and hedging tool against ETFs based on the same index, potentially lowering costs and increasing trading flexibility.","Cboe Introduces Enhanced Margin Treatment for Index Options Overwriting Strategies Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Cboe Global Markets introduces enhanced margin treatment for cash-settled index options, aiming to provide greater capital efficiencies for traders. The rule change allows traders to use cash-settled index options as a trading and hedging tool against ETFs based on the same index, potentially lowering costs and increasing trading flexibility. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent change in margin rules by Cboe Global Markets represents a strategic shift designed to enhance capital efficiencies for traders utilizing cash-settled index options. By allowing these options to be treated as covered when written against an ETF based on the same index, Cboe is essentially reducing the capital requirements for such trades. This potentially lowers the cost barrier for investors looking to implement options strategies, thereby increasing the accessibility of these financial instruments.From a financial perspective, this modification could lead to increased trading volumes as investors who were previously deterred by high margin requirements may now enter the market. Additionally, the potential tax benefits and mitigation of early exercise risks are attractive features that could sway investors' preference towards cash-settled index options over other hedging tools. The rule change could also stimulate more dynamic hedging strategies, as traders might find it more feasible to adjust positions in response to market movements without the constraint of high margin costs.However, it's important to note that while the rule change could free up capital, it does not eliminate the inherent risks of writing options. Investors must still manage the risk of adverse movements in the underlying ETFs and the increased leverage could amplify losses if the market moves against their positions. The long-term impact on the options market will depend on how traders balance these new efficiencies with the associated risks. Market Research Analyst Cboe's introduction of enhanced margin treatment for cash-settled index options is indicative of the evolving landscape of derivatives trading. By aligning the margin requirements of cash-settled index options with those of covered equity options, Cboe is acknowledging the growing demand for more sophisticated trading and hedging tools that cater to a diverse investor base. This rule change could potentially lead to a shift in trading patterns, as it makes the options market more attractive to retail and institutional investors alike.Market research suggests that the simplification and reduction of costs in trading can drive market participation. This change by Cboe could encourage a broader segment of the market to engage with index options, possibly increasing liquidity and tightening bid-ask spreads, which benefits all market participants. Moreover, by offering this margin relief, Cboe may be positioning itself as a more competitive exchange, potentially attracting traders from other platforms that have not yet adopted similar rules.It's also worth considering the competitive landscape this creates among exchanges and how they might respond. If Cboe's margin relief rule proves successful in attracting more traders and volume, other exchanges might implement similar measures to maintain their market share, leading to a broader industry-wide shift in margin policies. Risk Management Specialist While Cboe's margin rule change is designed to enhance capital efficiency, it also necessitates a discussion on risk management. By reducing margin requirements, the rule change effectively increases the leverage available to traders. While this can amplify profits, it also has the potential to magnify losses, particularly in volatile market conditions.Effective risk management strategies will become even more critical for traders taking advantage of the new margin treatment. They will need to conduct thorough market analysis and position sizing to ensure that the increased leverage does not lead to disproportionate losses. Additionally, traders must be aware of the cash-settlement feature of these index options, which differs from the physical delivery of assets in American-style options. Understanding the nuances of European-style exercise and cash settlement is important for managing the risks associated with these trades.Ultimately, the rule change by Cboe is a double-edged sword. It offers capital efficiencies and potential benefits but also requires traders to be diligent in their risk assessment and management practices. The long-term success of this rule change will be contingent on the ability of traders to utilize the enhanced margin treatment responsibly and within the bounds of sound risk management principles. 03/20/2024 - 10:00 AM Margin rule change aims to enhance capital efficiencies when writing cash-settled index options against ETFs based on the same indexEnables traders to use cash-settled index options as an efficient trading and hedging tool to manage positions at a potentially lower costCboe's suite of index options offer cash-settlement, European-style exercise and potential tax benefitsCHICAGO, March 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced the introduction of enhanced margin treatment for cash-settled index options. Cboe's margin relief rule aims to provide greater capital efficiencies for traders and reflects its ongoing commitment to advocating for smart and responsive market structure enhancements that meet the evolving needs of its customers. Cboe's margin relief rule offers enhanced margin treatment when writing, or selling, a cash-settled index option in a margin account against an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is based on the same underlying index. In the same way an investor can write an equity call option while holding a long position in the underlying security (i.e., a ""covered"" call), Cboe's rule change allows for writing of index options in a similar manner. An investor, for instance, could write a call option on the Mini S&P 500 Index option (XSP) while having a long position in a corresponding ETF such as the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), SPDR® S&P 500® ETF Trust (SPY), or Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) to potentially enhance returns on their ETF. Under the prior framework, there was no margin requirement for a short call that qualified as ""covered."" Given the similar risk/return profiles of writing an index call option (e.g., XSP) against a long ETF position (e.g., IVV, SPY, VOO) vs. writing a covered call, Cboe's rule now treats these index options as protected for margin purposes – and not subject to uncovered option margin requirements. This rule change is expected to enable traders to adopt overwriting options strategies at a potentially lower cost than is possible under the existing margin requirement, ultimately creating a more capital-efficient and flexible trading experience. ""Our margin rule represents an exciting development for the options market and provides an additional way for investors to incorporate cash-settled index options in their trading strategies,"" said Catherine Clay, Head of Global Derivatives at Cboe Global Markets. ""Index options can be an excellent trading and hedging tool, offering many unique advantages over existing alternatives. For investors with ETF positions, index options allow them to overwrite long positions with the ease of cash settlement, while potentially mitigating risks of early exercise and capitalizing on potential tax advantages. Our margin relief rule may also potentially free up capital for investors – which means more resources to allocate to other market opportunities to optimize their trading outcomes."" Cboe is the exclusive home for S&P Dow Jones, FTSE Russell and MSCI index options, along with options on the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX). Cboe's proprietary suite of index options are cash-settled (no transfer of the actual underlying asset; instead, any profit or loss is exchanged in cash upon expiration) and European-style (options can only be exercised at expiration, removing call-away risk and facilitating easier management of positions.) Cboe's rule applies to any index call or put option written against a position in a non-leveraged index mutual fund or non-leveraged ETF that is based on the same index underlying the index option and held in the same margin account. FINRA recently adopted a similar margin relief rule which conforms to Cboe's rule. To learn more about overwriting strategies with Cboe's index options, visit our website.

Speaking to media at a site visit to the mine, Bristow said Kibali was on track for another value-creating year on the back of a strong production performance. It was also well set to replace the ounces that were being depleted by mining with more of the same high quality. “Kibali has transformed what was previously the disadvantaged north-east region of the country into a new economic frontier and a flourishing commercial hub. Of our $5 billion investment in the DRC, more than half has been spent with local contractors and suppliers, many of whose growth into substantial businesses we have promoted by enhancing their commercial and technical skills and providing them with the opportunities to exercise these. Kibali’s third hydropower station, for example, was built by an all-Congolese team,” he said. Kibali’s recently announced that a collaboration with the ARSP, the public regulator which oversees the country’s sub-contracting sector, has already resulted in a range of initiatives, building on Kibali’s industry leading local content strategy. Meanwhile, Kibali continues its transition to renewable energy with the planned commissioning of a 16MW solar plant and associated batteries in 2025. The plant will increase the renewable energy use from 81% to 85%, with the mine running solely on renewal power during the six-month rainy season.

NXC-201 CAR-T therapy offers hope for relapsed/refractory patients.","Immix Biopharma Announces Major Comprehensive Cancer Center as Lead Site for NXC-201 AL Amyloidosis Clinical Trial Rhea-AI Impact (High) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags clinical trial Rhea-AI Summary Immix Biopharma, Inc. selects Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center as lead clinical site for NXC-201 clinical trial in AL Amyloidosis. NXC-201 CAR-T therapy offers hope for relapsed/refractory patients. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The partnership between Immix Biopharma and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to conduct a multi-site clinical trial for NXC-201 in AL Amyloidosis patients is a significant step for the company. The collaboration with such a prestigious institution not only lends credibility to Immix's research but also potentially accelerates the development process of NXC-201. This is particularly relevant as AL Amyloidosis is a rare disease with limited treatment options and advancements in this area could lead to substantial market opportunities.From a medical research perspective, the development of CAR-T therapies like NXC-201 is groundbreaking. CAR-T therapies, which involve modifying a patient's T-cells to attack cancer cells, have shown promise in treating certain types of cancer. If NXC-201 proves to be effective for AL Amyloidosis, it could pave the way for new treatment protocols and offer hope to patients with this challenging condition. However, the complexity and cost of CAR-T therapies could pose challenges in widespread adoption and reimbursement scenarios. Financial Analyst Investors closely monitor clinical trial advancements, especially in biopharmaceuticals focusing on novel therapies. Immix Biopharma's announcement regarding the clinical trial for NXC-201 could potentially impact the company's stock valuation. Positive trial outcomes often lead to increased investor confidence and can drive up stock prices, while negative results can have the opposite effect.Moreover, the association with a reputable clinical site like Memorial Sloan Kettering can attract additional investment and partnership opportunities. However, investors should be mindful of the inherent risks in biopharmaceutical investing, particularly in clinical-stage companies. The costs associated with conducting multi-site trials are substantial and the path to FDA approval is rigorous and uncertain. It's essential to consider the long-term investment horizon and the company's pipeline diversification when evaluating Immix's financial health and growth potential. Healthcare Industry Analyst The strategic decision to involve Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center as the lead site for the clinical trial underscores the importance of collaborative efforts in advancing medical treatments. For stakeholders within the healthcare industry, this move signifies a robust validation of Immix Biopharma's research direction and its potential impact on the market for AL Amyloidosis treatments.Given that AL Amyloidosis is a rare condition, the market size is relatively small, but the lack of effective treatments creates a high unmet medical need. If NXC-201 demonstrates efficacy and safety, it could command a premium price and enjoy orphan drug status, which offers benefits like market exclusivity. The long-term implications for the healthcare industry include not only the direct benefits for patients but also the potential for Immix to leverage its CAR-T platform to target other autoimmune diseases, potentially expanding its market reach. 03/20/2024 - 09:46 AM LOS ANGELES, CA, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immix Biopharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: IMMX) (“ImmixBio”, “Company”, “We” or “Us” or “IMMX”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company trailblazing cell therapies in AL Amyloidosis and other autoimmune diseases, today announced Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center as lead clinical site for its NXC-201 relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis multi-site clinical trial. “We are looking forward to this important multi-site clinical trial with NXC-201 CAR-T for patients with AL Amyloidosis,” said Heather Landau, MD, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Amyloidosis Program Director. “NXC-201 represents a novel direction in the treatment landscape for relapsed or refractory AL Amyloidosis patients.” About NEXICART-2 NEXICART-2 (NCT06097832) is an open-label, single-arm, multi-site Phase 1b dose expansion clinical trial in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis for CAR-T NXC-201 in the United States. NEXICART-2 is expected to enroll 40 patients over a period of approximately 18 months from first patient dosing. The objectives are the safety and efficacy of NXC-201. The expected primary endpoints are complete response rate and overall response rate according to consensus recommendations (Palladini et al. 2012). About NXC-201 We believe NXC-201 (formerly HBI0101) is the only “Single-Day CRS” BCMA-targeted CAR-T cell therapy that is uniquely suited to target AL Amyloidosis and other autoimmune diseases. It is being studied in a comprehensive clinical development program for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory AL amyloidosis, and expanding into other autoimmune indications. These trials build on a robust NXC-201 clinical dataset initiated in February 2021. NXC-201 has been awarded Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) by the FDA in both AL Amyloidosis and multiple myeloma, and awarded EU ODD by the EMA in AL Amyloidosis. About Immix Biopharma, Inc.

NX-1607 functions as an intramolecular glue, locking CBL-B in an inactive state to enhance T-cell activation. The drug is being tested in a Phase 1 trial as monotherapy and in combination with paclitaxel for various oncology indications. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The advancement of NX-1607 into clinical studies is a significant milestone in the field of immuno-oncology. This inhibitor targets CBL-B, an E3 ligase implicated in T-cell activation, which is a critical component of the body's immune response against cancer cells. By inhibiting CBL-B, NX-1607 could potentially enhance the immune system's ability to fight tumors. The ongoing Phase 1 trial is important to assess not only the safety and tolerability of NX-1607 but also its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, which will inform the optimal dosing strategy. If the data are positive, this could lead to a new class of immuno-oncology drugs with a mechanism distinct from current PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Medical Research Analyst The disclosure of NX-1607's structure and the initiation of its Phase 1 trial represent a combination of innovative drug design and strategic clinical development. As a first-in-class inhibitor, NX-1607's progression into clinical trials underscores the potential for a new wave of targeted protein modulation therapies. The biopharmaceutical industry is keenly interested in such advancements as they may offer alternative treatment options and expand the market for cancer therapies. The success of NX-1607 could also validate Nurix's platform and potentially lead to increased investor confidence in the company's pipeline. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Nurix's presentation at the American Chemical Society meeting enhances the company's visibility within the scientific and investment communities. The novelty of NX-1607's mechanism—acting as an intramolecular glue rather than targeting a classic enzymatic active site—positions Nurix at the forefront of ligase inhibition research. The market is always responsive to such innovation, particularly in the high-stakes oncology sector. As the trial progresses, positive results could have a favorable impact on Nurix's stock value and attract partnerships or funding for further development. Conversely, any setbacks in the trial could pose risks to the company's valuation and future prospects. 03/20/2024 - 09:40 AM Presentation highlights Nurix’s innovation and leadership in targeted protein modulation, including ligase inhibition Unique mechanism of action, an intramolecular glue, locks the E3 ligase Casitas B-lineage lymphoma proto-oncogene B (CBL-B) in a closed inactive state Phase 1 trial ongoing as monotherapy and in combination with paclitaxel in patients with a range of oncology indications SAN FRANCISCO, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nurix Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: NRIX), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing targeted protein modulation drugs designed to treat patients with cancer and inflammatory diseases, today disclosed the discovery and structure of NX-1607 in the First Time Disclosures session at the American Chemical Society Spring 2024 meeting in New Orleans, LA. This is the first inhibitor of CBL-B to advance into clinical studies and a prime example of Nurix’s ability to target previously undruggable E3 ligases. “Today’s presentation at the ACS meeting showcases Nurix’s innovative combination of structure-based-drug-design and industry-leading expertise in the biochemistry of E3 ligases,” noted Gwenn Hansen, Ph.D., Nurix’s chief scientific officer. “Our unique approach to drug discovery enables us to design novel drugs that either inhibit E3 ligases, such as NX-1607, or harness E3 ligases for targeted protein degradation.” In an oral presentation at the American Chemical Society Spring meeting entitled NX-1607: a First-In-Class Inhibitor of Casitas B-lineage Lymphoma B (CBL-B) for Immuno-Oncology, Nurix disclosed the structure of NX-1607 and its discovery history. NX-1607 acts as a specific intramolecular glue of the CBL-B protein, locking it in a closed and inactive conformation that lowers the threshold for T-cell activation. This mechanism of action is notable because CBL-B lacks a classic enzymatic active site binding pocket, preventing typical inhibitor design and thereby requiring a novel drug discovery approach. A copy of the presentation is available on the Posters and Presentations section of the scientific resources page of Nurix’s website. Nurix is testing NX-1607 in an ongoing, first-in-human, multicenter, open-label, Phase 1a/1b dose-escalation/expansion trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), and preliminary anti-tumor activity of NX-1607 in patients with advanced malignancies, including solid tumors and lymphoma. The trial includes both a monotherapy and a combination cohort utilizing paclitaxel. In 2024, Nurix expects to present data from the Phase 1a dose-escalation portion of the trial of NX-1607 and to define dose(s) to enable Phase 1b cohort expansion. Additional information on the clinical trial can be accessed at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05107674). About CBL-BCBL-B is an E3 ubiquitin ligase expressed in immune cells that regulates T-cell activation. CBL-B inhibition reduces T-cell exhaustion and increases cytokine production upon T cell receptor stimulation, overcoming suppressive signals in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, lack of CBL-B allows T-cell activation despite low target antigen expression on tumor cells, potentially reversing the tumor escape mechanism of resistance. Nurix is pursuing inhibition of CBL-B as a means to increase anti-tumor immune responses and potentially improve outcomes in patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. About Nurix Therapeutics, Inc.Nurix Therapeutics is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative small molecules and antibody therapies based on the modulation of cellular protein levels as a novel treatment approach for cancer, inflammatory conditions, and other challenging diseases. Leveraging extensive expertise in E3 ligases together with proprietary DNA-encoded libraries, Nurix has built DELigase, an integrated discovery platform, to identify and advance novel drug candidates targeting E3 ligases, a broad class of enzymes that can modulate proteins within the cell.

Negative None. 03/20/2024 - 09:30 AM Together, you and your pup could make a difference in the lives of others.NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 20, 2024 / Subaru of America, Inc.By Kristi ValentiniWaking my teen daughter, who was struggling with anxiety and desperately trying to avoid going to school, had become a challenge. Back rubs, bright lights and shouting ""good morning"" didn't work, and yelling just created more stress. One day, when I was all out of ideas, in marched our four-legged family member. Penny, a rescued beagle mix, knew exactly what to do.Penny could rouse my daughter and get her motivated better than anyone. Using her snout, Penny would burrow under my daughter's arm and then whine and groan and roll around on her back until my teen gave her belly rubs. On the toughest mornings, Penny's fail-safe method was placing her cold, wet nose on my teen's face.Once Penny garnered enough attention, she'd hop off the bed leaving my now smiling daughter ready to face the day. According to John Palladino, a director for Therapaws of Michigan and certified pet handler, Penny might make an excellent therapy dog. Throughout history, canines have aided their human companions in various roles, and recent studies have shown their ability to boost people's moods.Therapy dogs and their owners volunteer to visit various places, from hospitals to nursing homes to schools and airports. They offer individuals the chance to connect with a friendly dog and take a mental breather.""Therapy dogs are not service dogs,"" clarifies the American Kennel Club. ""Service dogs are specially trained to perform specific tasks to help a person with a disability,"" such as guiding someone who is blind. They are also different from a police-trained dog that is given special tasks in detection, patrol or tracking.""Seeing and interacting with dogs helps your brain quickly shift gears from whatever you were ruminating on to being present with the canine,"" says Palladino. As a professor of special education at Eastern Michigan University, Palladino also studies the benefits of pet therapy in the classroom.""The research is very clear on the effectiveness of pet therapy for children with anxiety and depression. In fact, just witnessing another person and dog interact across the room can normalize a person's blood pressure, heart rate, and stress hormones,"" he says.Palladino says Therapaws often has more requests for therapy dogs than they can fulfill. So if you're looking for a fun way to bond with your pet and make a positive impact in your community, volunteering to do pet therapy is a great option.Would Your Pooch Make a Good Therapy Dog?Therapy work is open to every kind of dog: purebred, mutt, young or old. Dogs need to be at least 1 year old and physically able to get around (or happy to sit in a stroller).""We're looking at the individual temperament of the dog. They should be stable, calm, able to settle easily and love to be petted,"" says Steve Calcagno, board member and evaluator for Bright & Beautiful Therapy Dogs.The general consensus is that having the right personality for therapy work is crucial. But good manners matter too. Can your dog sit, stay and come when called? Does your dog walk nicely on the leash without pulling and greet people without jumping on them? If not, your pup can still be a therapy dog with a little additional training. An easy way to tell if your dog is ready for testing is to go to a store that allows dogs - oftentimes hardware stores do - or walk your dog downtown. It's a good way to see if your dog enjoys interactions with strangers and can handle startling situations, such as kids running by, in a calm way. But Palladino advises against assessing your dog's responses in a pet store because the scents of other dogs may cause your pet to get defensive or behave differently than he or she might otherwise.What Are the Training and Certification Requirements?Dogs and their handlers (owners) are certified as a team. You can request an evaluation without any official training. It's up to you to decide if you think your dog is ready for the assessment, says Palladino. ""What you do to get ready to pass the evaluation is up to you. Some people take the American Kennel Club's Canine Good Citizen® training classes. Others train their dogs themselves or hire a trainer.""The evaluation is typically a multipart assessment to see how well your dog takes direction from you and how your dog responds to strangers, other dogs, and various situations like loud noises. During the assessment, the evaluator may suggest areas to improve upon or let you know if your dog seems like a natural fit for a certain type of pet therapy.How Do You Start Volunteering?Getting started is simple. Contact one of the American Kennel Club's recognized therapy dog organizations near you to learn their requirements for volunteering. They can recommend local training programs and the organization they want you to receive certification from.Volunteering is typically a low-key commitment, depending on what you want to do. It can range from participating in occasional special events, such as final exams week at universities, to volunteering regularly once or twice a week. But the impact you make is more than you realize, says Palladino, who has had people schedule their medical appointments around when his dog will be at the hospital. ""When I'm volunteering, people who interact with my dogs always say to me, ‘You have no idea how much I needed this.'""Search-and-Rescue DogsSearch-and-rescue dogs also perform an important community service, but the investment of time and money is higher than what is required for a therapy dog. The work is performed strictly on a voluntary basis.Fifteen years ago, Casandra Ulbrich, trailing instructor and co-founder of Wolverine State Search and Recovery, never imagined she'd be out searching for missing persons. It was her rambunctious puppy, a German shepherd named Jackson, who started her down the path. Jackson needed an outlet for his energy and intellect beyond the puppy training and agility classes they had already taken.""Someone suggested we try search-and-rescue training, and we both became hooked on it,"" says Ulbrich. ""You develop an amazing bond with your canine - you can read your dog's cues and know what they are sensing or feeling at a level most people will never experience.""Becoming a search-and-rescue team with your dog takes dedication. You have to finance up to two years of weekly training and commit to making yourself available whenever the need arises. ""If it's a live search, let's say a child wandered away from home, you could get a call at 2 o'clock in the morning,"" Ulbrich says. ""The expectation is that you go if you can because you could be the difference between life and death.""Want to learn more?

AgEagle Announces Sale of 50 RedEdge-P Multispectral Sensors to the Greek Ministry of Agriculture in Connection with Tender Award to the Consortium of ALVO,2024-03-20T13:30:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"AgEagle Aerial Systems Inc.

(UAVS) announces that its exclusive VAR in Greece, ALVO, has secured a tender from the Greek Ministry of Agriculture for 50 RedEdge-P multispectral cameras. The cameras will be integrated into UAVs for agricultural monitoring purposes, showcasing AgEagle's advanced technology and market expansion efforts. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The agreement between AgEagle Aerial Systems Inc. and the Hellenic Republic Ministry of Rural Development and Food represents a strategic expansion into the European agritech market. The deployment of 50 RedEdge-P multispectral cameras signifies an increasing demand for precision agriculture technologies. This demand is driven by the need to enhance crop yields and optimize farming practices through advanced data analytics. The integration of these high-resolution sensors with UAVs can provide farmers with detailed insights into crop health and soil conditions, potentially leading to more efficient resource management and reduced environmental impact.For investors, this partnership may indicate a positive trajectory for AgEagle's international market penetration and revenue growth. The focus on leveraging the partner/reseller network could amplify the company's global reach and influence, possibly resulting in an uptick in market share within the drone and precision agriculture sectors. However, it is important to monitor the execution of this project and subsequent revenue recognition to assess the long-term financial impact on AgEagle's performance. Agricultural Technology Expert The adoption of the RedEdge-P multispectral sensors by the Greek Ministry of Agriculture underscores the growing importance of advanced sensor technology in modern farming. These sensors are not just about capturing images; they facilitate a deeper understanding of plant health and soil quality, enabling targeted interventions that can improve yield and reduce waste. The ability to analyze vegetation indices and assess crop maturity at a high resolution can transform traditional farming methods, making them more sustainable and productive.From a technological standpoint, the integration of such sensors with UAVs is a testament to the rapid evolution of agritech. It's a significant step towards data-driven agriculture, where decision-making is increasingly reliant on precise and timely information. The success of this project could serve as a model for other countries looking to modernize their agricultural sectors, potentially opening new markets for companies like AgEagle. Financial Analyst The announcement of AgEagle's tender win with the Greek Ministry of Agriculture may have a positive impact on the company's financials. The sale of 50 multispectral cameras is a direct revenue-generating event and the mention of 'sizable new commercial and government tenders' suggests a healthy pipeline of future contracts. This could be a signal to investors of the company's growth potential and the scalability of its business model.However, investors should consider the cost structure associated with scaling up operations and the potential need for increased support and training for the reseller network. The balance between revenue growth and operational expenses will be key in determining the net effect on the company's profitability. Additionally, the market will be looking for evidence of sustained demand and the ability to replicate this success in other regions, which could further influence the company's valuation. 03/20/2024 - 09:30 AM WICHITA, Kan., March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AgEagle Aerial Systems Inc. (NYSE American: UAVS) (“AgEagle” or the “Company”), a leading provider of best-in-class full stack drone, sensors and software solutions for customers worldwide in the commercial and government verticals, today announces that ALVO, its exclusive Value Added Reseller (“VAR”) serving public and private companies and organizations in Greece, has been awarded a tender including drones and sensor payloads by the Hellenic Republic Ministry of Rural Development and Food in Greece (“Greek Ministry of Agriculture”).

With this conceptual project, Antler is targeting Carlin-type/sediment-hosted disseminated gold in an area that has strong mineralization potential - regional-scale thrust, faults, layered and folded permeable carbonate host rocks, and existing base metal occurrences indicating hydrothermal activity.Figure 4: Overview map of the new Victory Gold Target on license EPL-9134.

The NZ comprises carbonates, schists and siliciclastics of the Swakop Group, whereas the NMZ comprises deep-water carbonates of the coeval Otavi Group, and siliciclastic rocks of the Mulden Group (Table 1), the highest stratigraphic unit of the Damara Supergroup. Two glacial horizons, i.e. the Chuos and Ghaub diamictites, subdivide the Swakop and Otavi Groups into subgroups (Table 1), providing distinct lithological and geochronological markers, but outcrops of the Chuos within the EPL are poor. The sequences have been multiply folded and faulted (local and regional-scale) during the Pan-African Damara Orogeny during which the NZ has been thrust northwards onto Otavi, Mulden (NMZ) and pre-Damara rocks along the NE-trending, km-scale, deep-seated regional Khorixas-Gaseneirob Thrust (KGT), marking the edge of the NZ (Miller, 2008). This deformation history provides ample structural pathways, the right plumbing for superheated gold-bearing hydrothermal fluid channelization up through the crust and into the highly-permeable carbonate host rocks where it is potentially deposited as microscopic gold within pyrite. Gold-bearing hydrothermal fluids also carry arsenic, mercury, antimony and thallium that are important pathfinder elements that will guide exploration.Both the NZ and NMZ are host to numerous mineral deposits, including in the NZ the Otjikoto Gold Mine (B2Gold), the Ondundu and Eureka Gold Projects (Osino Resources) (Figure 1), the Okanjande Graphite deposit (Northern Graphite), the Okorusu Fluospar Mine, and in the NMZ, the Kombat and Berg Aukas polymetallic deposits, evidencing this geological environment's fertile nature.

Despite stock price challenges, Mr. Hu believes in the company's undervalued potential, expecting strong growth in sales revenue and profit in fiscal year 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The CEO's decision to increase his stake in Sunrise New Energy Co. sends a positive signal to the market about the insider confidence in the company's future. This action typically suggests that the CEO has a strong conviction in the company's business model and growth trajectory.

The CEO's share purchase could be a long-term bullish indicator, but it's essential to balance this with a comprehensive analysis of the company's financial health and market position. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the CEO's substantial investment in the company's stock may be seen as a commitment to aligning his interests with those of the shareholders. This move could also be interpreted as a form of indirect financial communication, suggesting that the company's internal metrics and future outlook might be more positive than what is currently reflected in the stock price.While this can be an encouraging sign, investors should conduct due diligence by reviewing the company's financial statements, evaluating its revenue growth, profit margins and cash flow stability. Additionally, the impact of the new factory's operational efficiency on the cost structure and the company's ability to capitalize on its technological innovations in hard carbon and silicon-carbon materials will be critical to its financial success.It's also important to monitor the company's upcoming financial reports to see if the CEO's optimism translates into tangible financial improvements. Any discrepancies between the CEO's actions and the company's performance should be scrutinized for a better understanding of the investment's potential risks and rewards. Industry Analyst The lithium battery materials sector is pivotal in the transition to renewable energy sources and Sunrise's expansion into this market aligns with global trends towards electrification. The partnerships with leading electric vehicle and energy storage battery manufacturers indicate strategic positioning within the supply chain. The CEO's share purchase might reflect confidence in the company's competitive edge and its ability to meet the growing demand for lithium battery materials.Understanding the company's product quality and innovation in hard carbon and silicon-carbon materials is essential, as these factors could determine Sunrise's market share against competitors. The industry's response to Sunrise's technological advancements will be telling of the company's potential to become a key player in the market.Investors should keep an eye on industry-specific developments, such as advancements in battery technology that could either enhance or diminish the relevance of Sunrise's product offerings. The company's ability to navigate these industry shifts will be a determinant of its long-term success. 03/20/2024 - 09:25 AM ZIBO, China, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sunrise New Energy Co., Ltd.

The RL-5K offers a 16% increase in load carrying capacity, a deep tread for cut resistance and traction, and features like a stronger radial carcass and multi-directional tread pattern.

The multi-directional tread pattern supports high torque applications and offers long wear and a smooth ride. Hi-Stability Technology in the radial sidewall enhances stability and reduces bucket sway during loading operations. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The introduction of Goodyear's new three-star RL-5K Off-the-Road (OTR) tire represents a strategic move to align with evolving market demands for heavy machinery tires. The enhanced load capacity and durability features are designed to cater to larger wheel loaders and dozers, which are critical in industries such as mining, construction and quarrying. The 16% increase in load carrying capacity signifies a substantial improvement over the previous model, potentially leading to increased productivity for end-users.From a market perspective, this launch could position Goodyear as a more competitive player in the OTR tire segment. The focus on innovation and product performance might attract new customers and retain existing ones, looking for high-quality, durable tires that can withstand harsh conditions. This could potentially increase Goodyear's market share and positively influence its revenue streams from the commercial tire sector. Financial Analyst The release of the RL-5K with a three-star rating may have a favorable impact on Goodyear's financial performance, particularly if the product gains traction in the OTR tire market. The initial investment in research and development for this advanced tire technology is likely to be offset by the premium pricing associated with its enhanced features. The increase in load capacity and the promise of longer wear could translate into a higher price point, potentially improving profit margins.Investors should monitor Goodyear's sales volumes of the RL-5K and customer feedback to gauge the product's success. Positive reception and adoption rates can lead to upward trends in Goodyear's stock as the market anticipates increased earnings from this new offering. However, it is essential to consider the competitive landscape and the possibility of rival companies launching similar products, which could mitigate the financial impact. Industrial Engineer The technical enhancements of the RL-5K tire, such as the larger bead bundle and radial construction, reflect Goodyear's commitment to engineering excellence. The extra-deep tread depth and multi-directional pattern are tailored for high torque applications, which is critical for heavy-duty machinery efficiency. Hi-Stability Technology aims to improve operational safety and efficiency by reducing bucket sway and promoting machine stability during loading operations.For businesses operating heavy machinery, the adoption of tires like the RL-5K could result in lower maintenance costs and downtime, thanks to the improved cut resistance and treadwear. These operational efficiencies could contribute to a lower total cost of ownership, making Goodyear's new tire a potentially attractive investment for companies looking to optimize their fleet operations. 03/20/2024 - 09:11 AM The RL-5K with three-star designation offers larger wheel loaders, more load carrying capacity and a deep tread for cut resistance and traction AKRON, Ohio, March 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (NASDAQ: GT) recently launched the new three-star RL-5K Off-the-Road (OTR) tire for large wheel loaders and wheel dozers.

The project aims to create thousands of jobs, generate over a billion dollars in economic growth, and deliver a smarter, stronger, cleaner energy grid over the next 6 years. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Economist Investments in energy infrastructure, such as National Grid's Upstate Upgrade, can have a profound effect on regional economies. The pledge of over $4 billion towards enhancing the electricity delivery system is indicative of a strategic shift towards a more resilient and sustainable energy framework. This move aligns with broader economic trends that prioritize infrastructure capable of integrating renewable sources and supporting the electrification of various sectors, including transportation.From an economic standpoint, the projected creation of thousands of jobs and the stimulation of up to $1.9 billion in economic output could contribute to a multiplier effect within the local economy. This is particularly relevant as the energy sector's evolution spurs ancillary industries and services. Additionally, the expected up to 2% economic growth in project areas through 2030 suggests a significant impact on the local GDP.However, while the short-term economic benefits are clear, the long-term returns must be evaluated against the costs of such a large-scale project. Factors such as project execution risks, potential cost overruns and the actual performance of the upgraded grid in terms of reliability and efficiency gains will be critical in determining the overall economic impact. Environmental Policy Analyst The Upstate Upgrade initiative by National Grid is a significant step towards meeting New York's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) goals. By focusing on the transmission of renewable energy, the project addresses a critical bottleneck in the shift towards a low-carbon economy. The modernization of the grid to withstand extreme weather and the implementation of advanced security measures to protect against external threats are pivotal in ensuring the reliability of the energy system amidst climate change-induced challenges.While the environmental benefits of transitioning to a cleaner grid are evident, it is important to scrutinize the actual implementation of the projects to ensure that they deliver the promised environmental improvements. The integration of renewable energy sources must be executed in a manner that maximizes efficiency and minimizes any unintended ecological impacts during the construction phase. Moreover, the long-term sustainability of these projects will depend on their adaptability to future technological advancements and regulatory changes. Infrastructure Development Expert The scope of National Grid's Upstate Upgrade, with the construction or rebuilding of over 1,000 miles of transmission line and 45 substations, represents an ambitious overhaul of existing infrastructure. This level of investment in grid modernization is essential for accommodating the increasing demand for electricity, especially with the growing adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps.However, the success of such infrastructure projects hinges on meticulous planning and execution. It is important to consider the potential for disruptions to communities and the environment during the construction phase. Furthermore, the adoption of new technologies to prevent load loss and manage load fluctuations is a testament to the evolving nature of energy demand and the need for a smarter grid. The effectiveness of these technologies in practice will be a key factor in realizing the expected benefits of improved reliability and resilience.Long-term, the project's ability to expand the property tax base and support local services will depend on sustained economic growth in the region. The interplay between the upgraded grid and the region's economic development trajectory will be an area to monitor closely, as it will offer insights into the broader impact of infrastructure investments on regional prosperity. 03/20/2024 - 09:15 AM Portfolio of 70+ transmission upgrade projects across Upstate NY will generate thousands of jobs and more than a billion dollars in regional economic growth over next 6 years, while delivering a smarter, stronger, cleaner energy grid for generations to come SYRACUSE, N.Y., March 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- National Grid plans to invest more than $4 billion to transform its energy delivery system and propel economic growth across Upstate New York. Called the Upstate Upgrade, the collection of transmission enhancement projects will deliver a smarter, stronger, cleaner energy grid to support a more resilient energy network for generations to come. The company is embarking on more than 70 projects through 2030 that will generate thousands of new jobs and more than a billion dollars in additional economic growth, while ensuring the energy grid is able to meet customers' growing demand for electricity. ""The Upstate Upgrade represents a landmark investment and speaks to how National Grid is reinforcing the grid to meet our customers' growing energy needs while leading the clean energy transition,"" said Rudy Wynter, National Grid New York President. ""This six-year portfolio of work will transform the grid, improve reliability and resilience and enable us to deliver renewable energy to homes and businesses across New York."" In addition to helping reach the state's climate goals as outlined in New York's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, the upgrades will deliver for Upstate New York customers by: Improving the Energy Grid's Resilience: By reinforcing and upgrading infrastructure like transmission lines and substations, the Upstate Upgrade will provide greater resilience in the face of increasingly frequent extreme weather, such as blizzards, tornadoes, and severe windstorms, which are destructive to grid infrastructure. That can mean fewer outages in the future and, when outages do happen, power can be restored quicker. Advanced security measures also will be implemented to safeguard our network from external threats. Strengthening the Upstate Economy: The Upstate Upgrade will benefit local economies by bringing over 1,700 new construction jobs, and associated residual spending to local communities, which in turn will create thousands of additional jobs, and at least $1.9 billion in overall economic output during and after construction, according to a third-party analysis performed by the consultancy West Monroe. The analysis also forecasts the Upstate Upgrade will create up to 2% economic growth in the project areas through 2030. Powering Upstate's Energy Future: As new industry drives growth and revitalizes the region, the Upstate Upgrade will ensure that the electric grid can meet customers' increasing day-to-day demands, including the needs of growing industries, while encouraging more investment and creating new jobs. The full scope of the Upstate Upgrade, including projects and benefits, can be found at our dedicated website: UpstateUpgrade.NationalGrid.com. Julie Tighe, President of New York League of Conservation Voters: ""There is no transition without transmission. Decarbonizing the state's grid will require more than just generating wind, solar, and hydro power; we also need the poles and wires to deliver all that electricity to our homes and businesses. We applaud National Grid for prioritizing clean energy delivery in New York State."" Rob Simpson, President and CEO of CenterState Corporation for Economic Opportunity: ""Recent economic development announcements in the Syracuse region and across Upstate demonstrate that the reliability of New York's electric grid and the availability of abundant, clean energy is a competitive advantage, nationally and globally. The Upstate Upgrade will support New York's increasing demand for electricity and encourage further investment and growth with a more efficient and resilient grid. With billions of dollars in new investment, and thousands of jobs generated directly and indirectly from National Grid's efforts, the Upstate Upgrade will help our businesses thrive and communities prosper."" Hui Peng Koh, GlobalFoundries VP and General Manager: ""We applaud National Grid for sharing in our commitment to innovation, job creation and sustainability. The electricity and semiconductor industries rely on each other, and the Upstate Upgrade will help our region achieve a cutting-edge energy infrastructure to support future growth."" Mark Eagan, President and CEO of the Capital Region Chamber and the Center for Economic Growth: ""The Upstate Upgrade will transform our electric grid and make additional economic growth possible throughout the state and into the Capital Region. This $4 billion investment over the next six years will spur significant job creation and ensure our communities remain vibrant, prosperous, and growing for years to come. A more resilient, secure, and efficient grid will help drive growth for the Capital Region and all New Yorkers."" Dottie Gallagher, President & CEO at the Buffalo Niagara Partnership: ""The Buffalo Niagara Partnership welcomes National Grid's comprehensive plan to invest in its electric infrastructure. Affordable, reliable energy is an essential component of economic development and National Grid's investments will help Buffalo Niagara and all of Upstate build a stronger, more competitive, and more equitable economy."" Nicholas Bruno, Vice President Business Development at Mohawk Valley EDGE: ""We commend National Grid for their ambitious Upstate Upgrade initiative, a testament to their commitment to building a smarter, stronger, and cleaner energy grid for the Mohawk Valley and Upstate New York. These upgrades bolster our local economies by contributing to the Marcy Nanocenter's prospective success, providing opportunities for additional industrial sites, creating new jobs, increasing property taxes, and ultimately contributing to a sustainable future aligned with New York's CLCPA goals. By prioritizing economic development and community engagement, National Grid sets a commendable example of corporate responsibility and partnership that Mohawk Valley EDGE applauds, and we look forward to seeing the results of their efforts."" Garry Douglas, President of the North Country Chamber of Commerce: ""Ample and reliable power in the North Country has never been more important than it is now with the major transition to electric from other energy sources and with economic development opportunities increasingly needing larger scale power access. That's why National Grid's Upstate Upgrade is so welcome and important. It is a very timely and indisputably crucial investment in sustaining and growing our regional economy in the years ahead and we thank National Grid for this historic commitment."" Anne Boles, Executive Director of the Fulton Montgomery Regional Chamber of Commerce: ""National Grid's Upstate Upgrade will power the Southern Adirondacks and Mohawk Valley's economic future. These critical upgrades will not only increase the capacity and resiliency of our electric grid, but will bring good-paying jobs, support existing businesses, and help spur new ones. Thanks to these investments, we can look forward to strengthening the region's business climate, economy, and quality of life. It is our mission at the Chamber to support innovation, and to partner in business, workforce, and tourism & economic development."" Patrick J. Kelly, Chief Executive Officer St. Lawrence County Industrial Development Agency: ""Robust, dependable, and secure electric grid infrastructure is a competitive necessity today and is essential for future economic development success. The Upstate Upgrade being undertaken by National Grid will continue to position central and northern New York State on the leading edge of the transition to renewable and clean energy sources, while reinforcing the foundation of our traditional industrial base."" The Upstate Upgrade website includes more perspectives from local leaders, as well as ways National Grid supports our communities. Modernized Grid Will Deliver for Customers, Communities National Grid's Upstate Upgrade focuses on modernizing the transmission system to meet the expanded electricity needs of the growing economy and to power more electrical devices than ever before, including electric vehicles and heat pumps. And, while the current network has served customers well for more than a century, it wasn't designed to connect and transport the amounts of wind and solar power that will be produced across the region. The company will construct or rebuild more than 1,000 miles of transmission line, 45 substations, and install new technologies that prevent load loss, monitor load fluctuations, and resolve congestion. This work also will protect the transmission grid against the increasing threat of extreme weather. ""The Upstate Upgrade is our largest investment in New York's electricity transmission system since it was built more than 100 years ago."" Wynter said. ""While the grid has served us well for over a century, it's time to make the changes that will set us up for the next century of growth and success in New York. ""In addition, the Upstate Upgrade brings with it a different type of energy: economic growth,"" Wynter said. ""It will fuel local economies where our work will be concentrated with new jobs and spending, and expand the property tax base that supports local services, schools and communities."" Economic analysis performed for National Grid by the consulting group West Monroe indicates that the Upstate Upgrade could generate nearly $2 billion in economic output across New York state. Economic Benefits of the Upstate Upgrade Direct Jobs Created During Construction More than 1,700 Total Economic Output At least $1.9 billion resulting in up to 2% increase in expected growth across the project areas Local Sourcing (During Construction) More than $300 million ""The Upstate Upgrade means thousands of new jobs for the region, not just boosting local businesses, but also increasing property values and the prospects for new storefronts in the region with improved energy infrastructure,"" said Paul DeCotis, a senior partner at West Monroe. ""As an Upstate New York resident, it's a real win-win for community members and business owners with more reliable electric service, opportunities for greater economic expansion, and long-term prosperity in our counties for generations to come."" Consistent, Transparent Information Sharing To support this historic grid rebuild, the company has launched a new website –UpstateUpgrade.NationalGrid.com – which will serve as a digital hub for details about the projects as they develop, including maps and updates, outreach events and how the Upstate Upgrade will benefit every New Yorker. ""National Grid is committed to working with and strengthening the communities we serve,"" Wynter said. ""One of the ways we do that is by conducting thoughtful, transparent outreach to residential and business customers, landowners, and elected officials to keep them informed about the Upstate Upgrade and offer them the opportunity to provide their thoughts. Our project website is another way we will be facilitating that conversation over the next six years.""

(GMGI) announces stockholder approval for the acquisition of MeridianBet Group. The acquisition aims to expand operations and global footprint. The completion is subject to funding and closing conditions, expected in April 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The approval by Golden Matrix Group Inc.'s stockholders to acquire MeridianBet Group signifies a strategic move that could potentially expand the company's market presence and operational scale. The acquisition is poised to enhance Golden Matrix's portfolio of online gaming and eCommerce platforms, which is a sector experiencing rapid growth globally. The integration of MeridianBet Group's assets could lead to synergy benefits, including an expanded customer base, increased market share and potentially improved economies of scale.Investors should note that the completion of the acquisition is contingent upon Golden Matrix raising sufficient funds, which introduces a degree of uncertainty. The company's ability to secure the necessary capital will be a critical factor in the successful finalization of the transaction. Market participants may watch for fluctuations in the company's stock price as the anticipated closing date approaches and as further details regarding funding emerge. Financial Analyst The shareholder vote in favor of the acquisition reflects confidence in management's strategy and the future growth prospects of Golden Matrix. The support from stockholders holding a substantial majority of the voting shares provides a strong mandate. However, the transaction's success will ultimately be measured by the post-acquisition financial performance, including the impact on earnings, cash flow and return on investment.With the transaction still subject to closing conditions, it is prudent for investors to consider the potential impact on the company's financial leverage. Should the company take on significant debt to finance the acquisition, there may be implications for its balance sheet strength and credit ratings. On the other hand, a successful integration could lead to revenue and profit growth, which would be a positive outcome for shareholders. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the acquisition's completion hinges not only on adequate funding but also on the fulfillment of other unspecified closing conditions. These conditions could include regulatory approvals, due diligence outcomes and other legal contingencies. Investors should be aware that such conditions can introduce delays or, in some cases, prevent a deal from concluding.The filing of the final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K ensures transparency and regulatory compliance. It is advisable for investors to review these filings to understand the detailed terms of the transaction and any potential legal risks that could influence Golden Matrix's future performance and obligations. 03/20/2024 - 09:15 AM LAS VEGAS, NV, March 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NewMediaWire – Golden Matrix Group Inc.

These indexes aim to provide diversified exposure to companies leading in climate transition readiness and action towards a low-carbon economy.","Morningstar Introduces Low Carbon Transition Leaders Indexes Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Morningstar, Inc. launches the Morningstar Low Carbon Transition Leaders Indexes in collaboration with Sustainalytics and Indexes businesses. These indexes aim to provide diversified exposure to companies leading in climate transition readiness and action towards a low-carbon economy. Positive None. Negative None. Sustainability Analyst With the introduction of the Morningstar Low Carbon Transition Leaders (LCTL) Indexes, there's a notable shift towards investment frameworks that prioritize environmental sustainability. This initiative reflects a broader trend in financial markets where there's an increasing demand for products that enable investors to align their portfolios with their environmental values, specifically in relation to climate change.These indexes offer a new tool for investors to gauge a company's performance against climate-related metrics. By focusing on companies that lead in reducing carbon intensity and aligning with net zero goals, the indexes provide a means to identify those businesses that are not only mitigating climate risks but also seizing the opportunities arising from the transition to a low-carbon economy.From a sustainability standpoint, the emphasis on tangible, forward-looking metrics is significant. It suggests a move away from retrospective, self-reported data towards a more dynamic and predictive approach to assessing corporate climate action. This could lead to a reallocation of capital towards companies that are better prepared for the low-carbon transition, potentially driving innovation and competitiveness in various sectors. Financial Analyst The launch of the LCTL Indexes can be seen as a strategic move by Morningstar to capitalize on the growing ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) trend in investing. By integrating Sustainalytics' Low Carbon Transition Ratings, these indexes provide a differentiated product that may attract investors looking for ESG-focused investment opportunities.For the stock market, the presence of these indexes could influence the flow of capital. Companies that rank highly on these indexes might experience increased investor interest, potentially leading to a higher demand for their shares and, consequently, an increase in their market valuation. Conversely, companies that fail to make the cut may face investor scrutiny or divestment.However, the impact on individual stock performance and the broader market will also depend on the adoption rate of these indexes by institutional and retail investors. If widely accepted, they could become a benchmark for evaluating company performance on climate action, thereby influencing corporate behavior and investment strategies. ESG Research Analyst The methodology behind the LCTL Indexes appears to be a comprehensive approach to ESG investing, as it not only considers a company's current carbon footprint but also its management strategies for transitioning to a low-carbon future. This dual focus on present action and future readiness is important for investors who are concerned about both the immediate and long-term impacts of climate change on their portfolios.For businesses, inclusion in these indexes could serve as an incentive to enhance their climate strategies and transparency in reporting emissions. It could also lead to a competitive advantage by signaling to investors and stakeholders that they are leaders in sustainability practices. This, in turn, may encourage other companies to follow suit, potentially leading to sector-wide improvements in carbon management and innovation in low-carbon technologies.It is important to note that the effectiveness of these indexes in driving real change will be contingent on their credibility and the rigor of the underlying ESG assessments. Continuous refinement of the methodologies and criteria used will be essential to maintain investor trust and to ensure that the indexes truly reflect the leaders in climate transition. 03/20/2024 - 09:07 AM New indexes draw on the strengths of Morningstar’s Sustainalytics & Indexes businesses to deliver diversified, broad exposure to companies leading their sector peers in their readiness for—and action towards—climate transition CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Morningstar, Inc. (Nasdaq: MORN), a leading provider of independent investment insights, announces the launch of the Morningstar® Low Carbon Transition Leaders (LCTL) Indexes™, the latest strategic collaboration between leading ESG ratings, research, and data provider Morningstar Sustainalytics and Morningstar Indexes, the world’s fastest growing global index provider. This series of nine new global, regional, and single country benchmarks is designed to help investors target a broad range of companies from every sector that are leading their peers in their readiness for—and action towards— transitioning to a low-carbon economy. The indexes are underpinned by tangible, forward-looking metrics including the Sustainalytics Low Carbon Transition Ratings, which identify which companies are taking the most action toward aligning with net zero. Rob Edwards – Global Director of ESG Product Management, Morningstar Indexes “Investors are focusing on the growing market impact of climate change, whether for managing investment risk or pursuing investment opportunity. Our clients want a simple and transparent way to identify and invest in the companies best positioned to thrive and survive in this scenario. Our Low Carbon Leaders are companies with management that understand how to evolve their business in this context to protect and grow their market share and innovation.” The indexes identify climate transition leaders by grouping companies from the parent index by sector, ranking them according to their composite Low Carbon Transition Leaders Score and capturing the top scoring 50% of each sector by market cap. The Low Carbon Transition Leaders Score considers a company’s current carbon intensity as well as its management score from the Sustainalytics Low Carbon Transition Ratings. The indexes also emphasize companies that report carbon emissions and are reducing their carbon intensity, as well as those whose business activities contribute positively to the environment. Companies included in the indexes are leading their peers in their approach to climate transition. Examples include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s largest semiconductor chip manufacturer and Orsted, the largest energy company in Denmark and a world leader in decarbonization. Anya Solovieva – Director, Global Commercial Strategy, Climate Solutions, Morningstar Sustainalytics “Our clients are grappling with an increasingly complex investment landscape and trying to get better understand how the transition to a low carbon economy will impact markets and companies. They are asking for better indexes, tools and analysis to differentiate between companies that are taking steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and are well positioned to succeed in a low carbon economy, and which may be left behind. Incorporating our Low Carbon Transition Ratings within an index methodology enables our clients to apply a forward-looking climate transition risk lens to their global portfolios and invest in leaders across all sectors.” About Morningstar, Inc.
