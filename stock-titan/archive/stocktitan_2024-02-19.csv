Convertible notes are debt instruments that investors can convert into equity, usually at a discount to the future equity price. The offering of up to $20 million signifies a strategic capital raise to fund the development of laser enrichment production facilities, which is a capital-intensive endeavor.From a financial perspective, the use of convertible notes is often a preferred instrument for companies seeking to minimize immediate dilution of existing shareholders while still raising capital. The terms of the conversion, particularly the 80% conversion price of the future equity value or a set valuation cap, are crucial to evaluate the level of potential dilution and the attractiveness of the notes to investors. The maturity term of five years provides a medium-term horizon for conversion, which suggests that QLE is optimistic about its growth prospects and the potential for a liquidity event such as an IPO or direct listing within that timeframe.However, investors should be aware that these notes are unsecured and may carry higher risk relative to secured debt. The inability to repay the notes prior to maturity, unless a change of control occurs, indicates that QLE is confident in its future cash flows but also ties the hands of management should they wish to retire the debt early. The use of proceeds for building production facilities indicates a direct investment in the company's core business operations, which could lead to revenue growth if successfully executed. Legal Expert The regulatory aspects of the convertible notes offering are particularly noteworthy. The notes are being offered in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons, in compliance with Regulation S under the United States Securities Act of 1933. This exemption allows companies to raise capital from international markets without the need to register the securities with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), thereby reducing regulatory overhead and expediting the capital raise process.However, it is important to note that the securities, both the notes and any common equity securities issued upon conversion, will not be registered under the Securities Act or any other securities laws. This limits the ability of investors to sell or transfer the securities within the United States, potentially reducing liquidity for these instruments. Furthermore, the absence of an offer to U.S. persons underscores the intention to target international investors and the need to comply with various international securities regulations.It is also critical to understand that such announcements do not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any securities. This legal language is standard to avoid prematurely engaging in activities that would be considered a public offering, which is subject to stringent regulations and requirements. Market Research Analyst ASPI's move to fund the development of laser enrichment production facilities through convertible notes is a strategic decision that reflects broader industry trends. Laser enrichment technology is a cutting-edge process that can significantly enhance the efficiency and output of isotope production, which has applications in medical, industrial and energy sectors. The investment in such technology could position QLE as a leader in the advanced materials industry if the technology proves successful.However, the success of this offering and subsequent facility development will hinge on market demand for enriched isotopes and the competitive landscape. If the market for these isotopes expands, due to factors such as increased use in medical diagnostics or clean energy initiatives, QLE could see substantial returns on their investment. Conversely, if the market growth is slower than anticipated or if competitors develop more cost-effective methods, the investment may not yield the expected results.The decision to offer notes offshore also reflects a strategic approach to tap into global capital markets, potentially diversifying the investor base and reducing reliance on domestic markets. This could be beneficial in spreading risk and accessing capital pools that have a strategic interest in the technology being developed by QLE. 02/18/2024 - 08:00 PM WASHINGTON, Feb. 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ASP Isotopes Inc. NASDAQ: ASPI (""ASP Isotopes” or “ASPI” or the “Company”), an advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes for the production of isotopes for use in multiple industries, announced today its intention to commence an offering by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Quantum Leap Energy LLC (""QLE”), of up to US$20 million aggregate principal amount of QLE’s convertible notes (the ""Notes""), subject to market and other conditions (the ""Notes Offering""). The Notes will be unsecured and may be convertible into common equity securities of QLE prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain events, including an initial public offering, direct listing or a future equity financing, in each case at a price per share equal to the lower of 80% of the per share price in the applicable transaction or the per share value of one share of QLE’s common equity based on a set valuation cap. The Notes will mature on the fifth anniversary of the initial closing, unless converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. QLE may not repay the Notes prior to maturity, unless a change of control transaction occurs. QLE intends to use the net proceeds from the Notes Offering for the planning for, building and development of laser enrichment production facilities, as well as general corporate purposes. There can be no assurance that the Notes Offering will be consummated or, if consummated, QLE will sell the maximum principal amount of Notes offered. The Notes are offered in offshore transactions outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""). The Notes and the common equity securities of QLE deliverable upon conversion of the Notes (if any) have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, and may not be sold or otherwise transferred in the United States except under an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and in compliance with any other applicable securities laws. No offering of the Notes or the common equity securities of QLE deliverable upon conversion of the Notes (if any) is being made into the United States or to U.S. persons. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any securities, nor shall there be a sale of the securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. This press release contains information about the pending Notes Offering, and there can be no assurance that such transaction will be completed. About ASP Isotopes Inc.

Nine workers are missing, and search and rescue operations are ongoing. The company expresses support for the families and the community, while also addressing legal matters and the revocation of the environmental permit. Remediation efforts are being planned, with third-party resources deployed. Environmental monitoring has shown no contamination so far. Positive None. Negative Revocation of the Çöpler environmental permit leading to suspension of operations, legal charges faced by team members, and ongoing search for missing workers pose challenges for SSR Mining Inc. Environmental Law Expert An incident at SSR Mining's Çöpler mine has led to significant operational and legal consequences. The revocation of the environmental permit is a critical development, as it directly halts operations, impacting the company's production and revenue. The permit revocation suggests non-compliance with environmental regulations, which can lead to costly fines and mandatory remediation efforts. Furthermore, the charges faced by team members indicate potential legal liabilities that could affect the company's financial health and reputation.The requirement for near-term remediation, particularly the relocation of heap leach material, implies a substantial financial burden for SSR Mining. This process is often costly and time-intensive, potentially disrupting the company's financial projections and affecting its stock market performance. Investors should monitor the situation closely, as the duration of the suspension and the cost of compliance with environmental standards will have direct implications for the company's short-term liquidity and long-term profitability. Mining Industry Analyst The suspension of operations at the Çöpler mine underscores the inherent risks associated with mining activities, particularly in regions with strict environmental oversight. The incident's impact extends beyond immediate operational disruptions to include potential long-term strategic shifts. Investors should note that mining companies often face elevated risk profiles due to the possibility of unforeseen events such as this, which can lead to operational shutdowns and impact future earnings.Monitoring the environmental assessments by the Turkish Ministry is vital, as they could lead to further regulatory action or provide a basis for the mine's potential reopening. The reported absence of contamination is a positive sign for SSR Mining, possibly mitigating some environmental concerns and associated costs. However, the market may still react negatively to the uncertainty surrounding the mine's future. Crisis Management Consultant SSR Mining's response to the incident, including the establishment of a waiting and information point for families, is a crucial aspect of crisis management, potentially mitigating negative public perception. Effective communication and support for affected individuals are key in maintaining stakeholder trust during such events. The deployment of third-party contractors for recovery and remediation efforts indicates a proactive approach to resolving the issue, which can be seen favorably by investors and regulators alike.However, the company's ability to manage this crisis effectively, including legal support for charged team members and transparent collaboration with authorities, will be under scrutiny. The effectiveness of the crisis response will likely influence investor confidence and could have a lasting impact on the company's brand and ability to attract future investment. 02/18/2024 - 09:37 PM DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SSR Mining Inc. (Nasdaq/TSX: SSRM; ASX: SSR) (“SSR Mining” or the “Company”) provides an update on ongoing rescue efforts at the Çöpler mine in Türkiye.

About Opthea Opthea (ASX:OPT; NASDAQ:OPT) is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies to address the unmet need in the treatment of highly prevalent and progressive retinal diseases, including wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME). Opthea’s lead product candidate sozinibercept, is being evaluated in two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials (COAST, NCT04757636 and ShORe, NCT04757610) for use in combination with standard of-care anti-VEGF-A monotherapies to improve overall efficacy and deliver superior vision gains compared to the standard-of-care anti-VEGF-A agents.

IZERVAY™ is a trademark of IVERIC bio, Inc., An Astellas Company Inherent risks of Investment in Biotechnology Companies There are a number of inherent risks associated with the development of pharmaceutical products to a marketable stage. The lengthy clinical trial process is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a drug prior to commercialization and a significant proportion of drugs fail one or both of these criteria. Other risks include uncertainty of patent protection and proprietary rights, whether patent applications and issued patents will offer adequate protection to enable product development, the obtaining of necessary drug regulatory authority approvals and difficulties caused by the rapid advancements in technology. Companies such as Opthea are dependent on the success of their research and development projects and on the ability to attract funding to support these activities. Investment in research and development projects cannot be assessed on the same fundamentals as trading and manufacturing enterprises. Therefore, investment in companies specializing in drug development must be regarded as highly speculative. Opthea strongly recommends that professional investment advice be sought prior to such investments.

Positive The acquisition of Discover by Capital One is valued at $35.3 billion, with Discover shareholders receiving 1.0192 Capital One shares for each Discover share, representing a 26.6% premium based on Discover's closing price on February 16, 2024. The combined company will have a global payments platform with 70 million merchant acceptance points in over 200 countries, positioning it to compete with major payments companies and deliver enhanced value to over 100 million customers. The transaction is expected to generate $2.7 billion in pre-tax synergies and be more than 15% accretive to adjusted non-GAAP EPS in 2027, with a return on invested capital of 16% and an internal rate of return exceeding 20%. Capital One's acquisition of Discover aims to leverage technology, data ecosystem, and customer base to drive sales for merchants and offer great deals for consumers and small businesses, building a globally competitive payments network. Both companies have a strong track record of financial performance, customer experiences, innovation, and inclusion, with a focus on delivering value to consumers, small businesses, merchants, and shareholders. The transaction is expected to close in late 2024 or early 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, with three Discover Board members joining the Capital One Board of Directors upon closing. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of Discover by Capital One represents a significant consolidation in the financial services industry, particularly within the payments and credit card sectors. The all-stock deal, valued at $35.3 billion, indicates a strategic move by Capital One to enhance its market position against major payments networks. The 26.6% premium paid over Discover's closing price suggests Capital One's confidence in the synergies and future earnings potential of the combined entity.An important aspect to consider is the expected generation of $2.7 billion in pre-tax synergies by 2027. This figure is substantial and indicates operational efficiencies and potential cost savings. The accretive nature of the transaction to the non-GAAP EPS by over 15% in 2027 is a positive signal to shareholders, as it suggests earnings growth post-acquisition. Moreover, the projected ROIC of 16% and IRR exceeding 20% are robust metrics that underscore the financial soundness of the deal.The combined entity's capital position, with a CET1 ratio of approximately 14%, remains strong, providing resilience and potential for further growth. The increase in insured deposits to 84% is also a noteworthy aspect, as it may contribute to the stability of the combined company's funding base. Market Research Analyst The merger between Capital One and Discover creates a payments platform with 70 million merchant acceptance points globally, which is significant in the context of competing with larger payments companies. The scale and reach of this network can be expected to provide competitive advantages in terms of merchant relationships and consumer offerings.Furthermore, the combination of Capital One's 'Digital First' banking strategy with Discover's direct savings bank could accelerate growth in the national banking sector. This is particularly relevant as the banking industry continues to shift towards digital platforms. The customer experience accolades received by Capital One, such as the #1 ranking in U.S. National Banking Overall Customer Satisfaction by J.D. Power, could be further enhanced by Discover's contributions.It is also important to note the implications for market competition. The merger reduces the number of independent credit card networks, potentially altering competitive dynamics. Regulators and industry observers will likely scrutinize the impact on consumers and merchants to ensure that the consolidation does not lead to reduced choices or increased fees. Technology Transformation Expert Capital One's eleven-year technology transformation is a cornerstone of this acquisition. The integration of Discover's businesses into this advanced technological framework is expected to drive innovation and efficiency across the combined enterprise. The emphasis on a 'Digital First' approach aligns with broader industry trends towards real-time marketing, enhanced risk management and improved customer experiences.The ability to scale Capital One's technology across Discover's network could lead to faster product development and more personalized services for consumers. This tech leverage is critical in the financial sector where fintech companies and traditional banks are in a continuous race to provide cutting-edge digital solutions. The success of this technology integration will be a key determinant of the combined company's ability to deliver on the promised synergies and maintain a competitive edge in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. 02/19/2024 - 06:41 PM Under the terms of the agreement, Discover shareholders will receive 1.0192 Capital One shares for each Discover share, representing a premium of 26.6% based on Discover's closing price of $110.49 on February 16, 2024.

The transaction brings together two companies with long-standing track records of delivering attractive and resilient financial results, award-winning customer experiences, breakthrough innovation, and financial inclusion. Under the terms of the agreement, Discover shareholders will receive 1.0192 Capital One shares for each Discover share, representing a premium of 26.6% based on Discover's closing price of $110.49 on February 16, 2024. At close, Capital One shareholders will own approximately 60% and Discover shareholders will own approximately 40% of the combined company. ""From Capital One's founding days, we set out to build a payments and banking company powered by modern technology. Our acquisition of Discover is a singular opportunity to bring together two very successful companies with complementary capabilities and franchises, and to build a payments network that can compete with the largest payments networks and payments companies,"" said Richard Fairbank, founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Capital One. ""Through this combination, we're creating a company that is exceptionally well-positioned to create significant value for consumers, small businesses, merchants, and shareholders as technology continues to transform the payments and banking marketplace."" ""The transaction with Capital One brings together two strong brands with enhanced ability to accelerate growth and maximizes value for our shareholders, enabling them to participate in the tremendous upside of the combined company,"" said Michael Rhodes, CEO and President of Discover. ""This agreement underscores the strength of our business and is a testament to the hard work of Discover employees. We look forward to a bright future as part of the Capital One family and to providing expanded opportunities for our loyal customers."" Powerful Strategic Rationale: Positioned to Deliver for Consumers, Small Businesses, and Merchants Building a Globally Competitive Payments Network Discover has built a rare and valuable global payments network with 70 million merchant acceptance points in more than 200 countries and territories. Even so, it is the smallest of the four US-based global payments networks. This acquisition adds scale and investment, enabling the Discover network to be more competitive with the largest payments networks and payments companies. This is a key foundation in Capital One's quest to build a global payments company. It will accelerate the company's long-standing journey to work directly with merchants to leverage its customer base, technology, and data ecosystem to drive more sales for the merchant and great deals for consumers and small businesses.Combining Complementary Card Businesses Capital One and Discover are proven credit card franchises with complementary strategies and a shared focus on the customer. Both companies have developed compelling flagship products, award-winning customer experiences, and powerful brands. They have also both delivered attractive and resilient growth and returns through economic cycles. The combined credit card business will be in an even stronger position to deliver industry-leading products and experiences that span the credit card marketplace across consumers, small businesses, and merchants.Scaling our ""Digital First"" National Bank Capital One Bank is propelled by an iconic customer experience and a strikingly simple value proposition. It is the only major bank with no fees, no minimums, and no overdraft fees. According to J.D. Power, customers have rated Capital One Bank #1 in U.S. National Banking Overall Customer Satisfaction for four consecutive years. Customers can enjoy an entirely digital, full-service banking experience, or visit one of 259 branches, more than 80,000 fee-free ATMs, more than 16,000 cash deposit locations, and 55 iconic Capital One Cafes in 21 of the country's 25 largest metro areas. Adding Discover's fast-growing national direct savings bank will increase the combined company's scale to compete with the nation's largest banks, and the Discover Global Network brings a significant opportunity to accelerate national banking growth.Leveraging our Technology Transformation Capital One will scale and leverage the benefits of an eleven-year technology transformation across all of Discover's businesses and the network. Capital One's technology transformation is powering innovation, much faster speed to market, breakthrough products and experiences, real-time customized marketing, faster growth, better underwriting, enhanced efficiency, and better risk management and compliance.Compelling Financial Results Creating Significant Synergies The transaction is expected to generate expense synergies of $1.5 billion in 2027 (26% of Discover operating expenses, plus 10% of Discover marketing expenses), driven by common business functions partially offset by targeted investments in the Discover network. The acquisition is expected to generate network synergies of $1.2 billion in 2027, driven by adding Capital One debit purchase volume and selected credit card purchase volume to the Discover network.Delivering Attractive Accretion and Returns The deal is expected to be more than 15% accretive to adjusted non-GAAP EPS in 2027. The transaction is expected to deliver return on invested capital of 16% in 2027, with an internal rate of return in excess of 20%.Strengthening a Strong Balance Sheet The transaction will further strengthen Capital One's balance sheet. On a pro forma basis, the combined company would have a CET1 ratio of approximately 14% at closing, and 84% of company deposits would be insured as of year-end 2023.Making a Positive Difference in our Communities Both Capital One and Discover have proud histories of commitments to their communities. Capital One has a long-standing track record of ""Outstanding"" Community Reinvestment Act performance since 2001, and has ranked first or second in community development lending among all banks since 2015, with over $59 billion in CRA-qualified loans over that period. Capital One is in the fourth year of its 5-year, $200 million Impact Initiative, supporting non-profit organizations seeking innovative solutions to address Affordable Housing, Workforce Development, Small Business Creation, Financial Well-being and Digital Access. Capital One appreciates the importance of Chicagoland and remains committed to maintaining a strong presence in that market, as well as maintaining service excellence across the U.S.Building One of America's Great Places to Work Both Capital One and Discover have been recognized as great places to work on the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For® list. This year was Capital One's 12th consecutive year on the prestigious list.Timing and Approvals The transaction is expected to close in late 2024 or early 2025, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and approval by the shareholders of each company. Governance Upon closing, three Discover Board members, to be named at a later date, will join the Capital One Board of Directors.

Aerospace Engineer The successful deployment of the ADRAS-J satellite by Rocket Lab's Electron rocket signifies a critical advancement in orbital debris mitigation, a growing concern within the aerospace community. The ability to rendezvous with and potentially de-orbit defunct satellites and rocket stages is a milestone in space sustainability efforts. As space becomes increasingly congested, the risk of collisions, which can generate further debris, poses a significant threat to both current and future missions. The technology demonstrated by Astroscale Japan Inc could become a cornerstone in the emerging field of on-orbit servicing and debris removal, with implications for satellite operators, space agencies and companies involved in space logistics and infrastructure.Moreover, the mission's demand for high precision in orbital insertion and the tight launch timing showcases Rocket Lab's technical capabilities. This level of precision is essential for the intricate maneuvers required for debris monitoring and removal, setting a precedent for future missions. The success of such missions could lead to increased demand for Rocket Lab's services, potentially impacting the company's market position and financial performance positively. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Rocket Lab's successful launch and deployment of the ADRAS-J satellite may have favorable implications for the company's stock valuation. Investors often look for consistent performance and innovation as indicators of a company's growth potential. This launch demonstrates Rocket Lab's ability to execute complex missions with stringent requirements, which could enhance its reputation and lead to new contracts. The growing concern over space debris and the need for sustainable space operations could translate into a new revenue stream for companies like Rocket Lab, as the demand for debris removal services is expected to increase.However, investors should also consider the costs associated with developing such advanced technologies and the competitive landscape of the space industry.

MAHIA, New Zealand--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today launched its 44th Electron rocket, successfully deploying an orbital debris inspection satellite for Astroscale Japan Inc. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240218296478/en/Rocket Lab's Electron launch vehicle lifts-off for the 'On Closer Inspection' mission for Astroscale Japan. (Photo: Business Wire) The mission, named “On Closer Inspection”, launched from Pad B at Rocket Lab’s Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand at 03:52 NZDT February 19th, 2024 (14:52 UTC, February 18th). Electron deployed the Active Debris Removal by Astroscale-Japan (ADRAS-J), a satellite designed to test technologies and operations for approaching and monitoring debris objects in orbit, also known as space junk. The mission is the first phase in assessing the potential for satellites to rendezvous with orbital debris objects in future and assist in de-orbiting them, supporting space sustainability for future generations. Following the successful launch on Electron, the 150-kilogram ADRAS-J satellite will now approach an aged, derelict rocket stage in orbit to observe it closely, understand how it behaves and determine potential methods for its assisted deorbiting in future. The rocket stage it will be observing is the Japanese H-2A upper stage left in low Earth orbit after the launch of the GOSAT Earth observation satellite in 2009. ADRAS-J will fly around the stage, 11 meters long and four meters in diameter, inspecting it with cameras and sensors. Astroscale’s full mission will take between three and six months to complete. “Congratulations to the Astroscale team on this historic mission that paves the way for new and innovative ways to reduce orbital debris and ensure space remains safely accessible,” said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck. “It’s a real honor to provide a dedicated launch service and enable the kind of precise orbital maneuvers required for an advanced mission like this.” To enable the ADRAS-J satellite to rendezvous with the derelict H-2A upper stage in orbit, Rocket Lab had to design a mission with strict launch timing and precision orbital deployment parameters. Rocket Lab only received the final perigee, apogee, and inclination from Astroscale 20 days before launch, parameters that are typically determined many months in advance of a launch. Only then could argument of perigee targets for different days within the launch window be selected, essentially determining the timing of Electron Kick Stage burns to facilitate the unique elliptical orbit required depending on the launch date. The mission demanded highly accurate orbital insertion with tighter margins than required on most standard missions. The exact T-0 was only able to be defined the day prior to launch and the required LTAN accuracy only allows for +/- 15 seconds, demonstrating Rocket Lab’s capability to deliver rapid and responsive advanced guidance, navigation and control analysis. “Today’s successful launch of ADRAS-J marks another milestone toward our efforts to grow the on-orbit servicing sector while creating a sustainable space environment,” said Astroscale founder & CEO Nobu Okada. “We are grateful for the collaboration with Rocket Lab, whose expertise in dedicated launch services has been instrumental to the start of this ground breaking mission.” Images and video from the launch of ‘On Closer Inspection’ are available for download here: https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjBdtqX ‘On Closer Inspection’ was Rocket Lab’s second launch of 2024 and the Company’s 44th Electron launch overall. + About Rocket Lab Founded in 2006, Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company with an established track record of mission success.

Readers are cautioned that all forward-looking statements are based upon current expectations and estimates and apply only as of the date of this report. PNMR, PNM, and TNMP assume no obligation to update this information. Because actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, PNMR, PNM, and TNMP caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements.

Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresGAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. Ongoing earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of net unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on economic hedges, the net change in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities, pension expense related to previously disposed of gas distribution business, and certain non-recurring, infrequent, and other items that are not indicative of fundamental changes in the earnings capacity of the Company's operations. The Company uses ongoing earnings and ongoing earnings per diluted share to evaluate the operations of the Company and to establish goals, including those used for certain aspects of incentive compensation, for management and employees. While the Company believes these financial measures are appropriate and useful for investors, they are not measures presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not intend for these measures, or any piece of these measures, to represent any financial measure as defined by GAAP. Furthermore, the Company's calculations of these measures as presented may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company uses ongoing earnings guidance to provide investors with management's expectations of ongoing financial performance over the period presented. While the Company believes ongoing earnings guidance is an appropriate measure, it is not a measure presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not intend for ongoing earnings guidance to represent an expectation of net earnings as defined by GAAP. Since the future differences between GAAP and ongoing earnings are frequently outside the control of the Company, management is generally not able to estimate the impact of the reconciling items between forecasted GAAP net earnings and ongoing earnings guidance, nor their probable impact on GAAP net earnings without unreasonable effort, therefore, management is generally not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for ongoing earnings guidance. Reconciliations between GAAP and ongoing earnings are contained in schedules 1-4.

The acquisition expands Dream Finders' presence in Charleston, Greenville, and Nashville markets. Zelman has completed six M&A transactions worth over $1.5 billion in the past year, showcasing expertise in the housing sector. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Crescent Homes by Dream Finders Homes represents a strategic move to diversify and expand the company's market presence. By entering the Charleston, Greenville and Nashville markets, Dream Finders Homes is not only increasing its geographic coverage but also tapping into the economic growth and demographic shifts favoring the Southeastern United States. The homebuilding industry is cyclical and sensitive to economic indicators such as interest rates, employment levels and consumer confidence. Expanding into these markets could mitigate regional risks and provide new revenue streams.It is also worth noting that the acquisition is part of a broader trend in the industry where consolidation is becoming more common as homebuilders seek economies of scale and market share gains. This trend is often a response to increasing land and construction costs, as well as a way to leverage brand recognition and operational efficiencies. For stakeholders, the short-term benefits may include stock price appreciation due to anticipated synergies, while long-term benefits could include improved competitive positioning and increased market share. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the acquisition's impact on Dream Finders Homes' balance sheet and earnings is critical. The deal size, while not disclosed in the article, is likely significant given Zelman Partners' historical transaction values. Investors will be keen on understanding the acquisition's financing structure, whether it involves cash, debt, or stock and how it will affect Dream Finders Homes' leverage ratios.Furthermore, the integration process will be closely watched for its efficiency and effectiveness in realizing the projected synergies. Cost savings and cross-selling opportunities are typical justifications for such M&A activity and their realization will be pivotal for the deal to be accretive to earnings. The market will also look for management's guidance on anticipated impacts on revenue and profit margins, as well as any potential changes in the company's strategic direction post-acquisition. Economist An economist's viewpoint would highlight the broader economic implications of the deal. The housing market is a significant component of the U.S. economy and activity in this sector can be a bellwether for overall economic health. The acquisition suggests confidence in the housing market's prospects, particularly in the Southeastern U.S., which has been experiencing population growth and a robust job market.Additionally, the deal could have a multiplier effect on the local economies of the markets Dream Finders Homes is entering. The construction of new homes generates employment and stimulates demand for goods and services. However, it's important to monitor the affordability and supply issues in the housing market, as these could be affected by consolidation in the industry, potentially influencing the pace of new home construction and pricing strategies. 02/19/2024 - 06:00 AM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Zelman Partners, A Walker & Dunlop Company (NYSE: WD), served as exclusive buy-side M&A advisor to Dream Finders Homes (NYSE: DFH) on its acquisition of privately-owned homebuilder Crescent Homes. The acquisition meaningfully enhances Dream Finders’ geographic footprint and allows the company to expand into the markets of Charleston and Greenville, South Carolina, and Nashville, Tennessee. “This is Zelman’s sixth M&A transaction in the last 12 months totaling more than $1.5 billion of transaction value and representing over 70% market share over that time frame. These transactions range in size from $25 million to more than $450 million and include buy-side and sell-side advisory roles involving private homebuilders, single-family land developers and multifamily developers, clearly demonstrating our ability to provide leading M&A services to clients of any size across the housing ecosystem. I’m incredibly proud to be surrounded by the most talented, dedicated, experienced, and hard-working colleagues in the business,” stated Zelman’s Head of Investment Banking, Tony McGill. Patrick Zalupski, Dream Finders’ founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, shared: “We have a long history of working with the Zelman team, initially as an industry advisor when we were raising private capital, then on our IPO in 2021, our debut High Yield issuance in 2023, and as our buy-side advisor on this acquisition.

Air Astana's GDRs trade on LSE, AIX, and Rule 144A GDRs. Each GDR represents four ordinary shares. Citi to provide support through its global network. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The appointment of Citi as depositary bank for Air Astana's Global Depositary Receipt (GDR) program is a strategic move that could facilitate increased liquidity and access to a broader range of investors. GDRs are a financial instrument used by companies to attract foreign investors without the complexities of listing abroad. For Air Astana, this could mean enhanced visibility and potentially better valuation due to the diversification of its investor base.From a financial perspective, the partnership with a reputable institution like Citi, known for its extensive equity distribution network, could bolster investor confidence in Air Astana's GDRs. The ability to trade on the London Stock Exchange and Astana International Exchange provides a dual market exposure, which is often attractive to institutional investors seeking to diversify their portfolios across emerging markets.However, it is crucial to monitor the trading volume and price performance of Air Astana’s GDRs post-appointment to gauge the effectiveness of Citi's investor outreach initiatives. The success of such programs is not guaranteed and depends on various factors, including market conditions and investor sentiment towards the airline industry, which can be volatile. Market Research Analyst The airline industry has seen significant challenges and companies like Air Astana must navigate these while maintaining investor interest. The partnership with Citi could provide Air Astana with strategic advantages in terms of market research and investor relations advisory, which are critical for understanding investor behavior and market trends.By tapping into Citi's global network, Air Astana could gain insights into how to position itself competitively in the global market. This includes understanding the nuances of investor expectations in different regions, which can significantly impact the demand for GDRs. Furthermore, the dual listing on the LSE and AIX could offer a unique proposition to investors looking for exposure to Central Asian markets.It will be important to analyze the long-term impact of this move on Air Astana's market share and financial health. The ability to attract foreign capital can be a catalyst for growth, but it also requires the company to adhere to international reporting standards and maintain transparency, which can be a challenge for some firms. 02/19/2024 - 05:00 AM LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Citi’s Issuer Services, acting through Citibank, N.A., has been appointed by Air Astana Group (“Air Astana”), the flag carrier airline of Kazakhstan, to act as depositary bank for its Global Depositary Receipt (“GDR”) program.

Economist The announcement of the $1.5 billion investment into GlobalFoundries, supported by the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, signifies a strategic move to bolster the domestic semiconductor industry. This investment is expected to have a profound macroeconomic impact, enhancing the U.S.'s competitiveness in a critical technology sector and potentially reducing reliance on foreign chip manufacturing. The semiconductor industry is a cornerstone of modern technology and its growth is tightly coupled with the overall economic progress and national security.From an economic standpoint, the creation of over 1,500 manufacturing jobs will contribute to local economies, potentially improving employment rates and stimulating economic activities in New York and Vermont. Additionally, the modernization and expansion efforts are likely to have a multiplier effect, attracting further investments and fostering innovation within the sector. The long-term implications include bolstering the supply chain resilience, which is crucial given the recent disruptions experienced globally.However, one must consider the risks associated with such large-scale investments. The semiconductor industry is known for its cyclical nature and the market demand can fluctuate significantly. Moreover, the success of these initiatives depends on the execution and the ability to adapt to the rapidly evolving technology landscape.

The strategic investment to expand and construct new fabrication facilities is poised to meet the expected surge in customer demand for U.S.-made chips. Given the semiconductor market is forecasted to double over the next decade, GlobalFoundries' move to capture a significant share of the essential chip segment, which constitutes over 60% of the market, is a calculated decision.From a market perspective, this investment could enhance GlobalFoundries' competitive position, potentially increasing its market share and revenue. The focus on feature-rich mature chips is particularly noteworthy, as these components are crucial for a wide array of applications and less susceptible to the rapid obsolescence seen in cutting-edge chips. The diversification into new technologies and end markets could provide a hedge against market volatility.Investors and stakeholders should monitor the company's ability to scale production efficiently and the adoption rate of the new technologies, such as gallium nitride semiconductors, which are expected to play a pivotal role in next-generation applications. Financial Analyst The planned investment of $1.5 billion by the Department of Commerce, along with additional state funding and incentives, reflects a strong public-private partnership model. This model is instrumental in financing large-scale infrastructure projects that might otherwise be too capital-intensive for private entities to undertake alone. The financial implications for GlobalFoundries include not just an influx of capital but also the potential for increased valuation due to anticipated growth and capacity expansion.Investors should consider the impact of these investments on GlobalFoundries' balance sheet and future cash flows. While the capital infusion and increased capacity are positive indicators, the actual return on investment will depend on the company's operational efficiency and market demand. It is also important to note the additional $600 million in benefits, which could provide a significant financial cushion and support for workforce development and infrastructure upgrades.Long-term, the investments are expected to increase wafer production to 1 million per year, which could lead to economies of scale and potentially lower production costs per unit. However, the capital expenditure and ongoing costs associated with maintaining and operating state-of-the-art facilities must be weighed against these benefits. 02/19/2024 - 05:30 AM $1.5 billion potential investment will support the expansion of GlobalFoundries New York facility, including construction of a new state-of-the art fab, and the modernization of its Vermont facility, adding secure capacity for essential chip manufacturing for automotive and other key markets Additional $600 million plus planned in New York State Green CHIPS and other State benefits over the 10-year term of the New York projects MALTA, N.Y. and ESSEX JUNCTION, Vt., Feb. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The U.S. Department of Commerce today announced $1.5 billion in planned direct funding for GlobalFoundries (Nasdaq: GFS) (GF) as part of the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act. This investment will enable GF to expand and create new manufacturing capacity and capabilities to securely produce more essential chips for automotive, IoT, aerospace, defense, and other vital markets. New York-headquartered GF, celebrating its 15th year of operations, is the only U.S.-based pure play foundry with a global manufacturing footprint including facilities in the U.S., Europe, and Singapore. GF is the first semiconductor pure play foundry to receive a major award (over $1.5 billion) from the CHIPS and Science Act, designed to strengthen American semiconductor manufacturing, supply chains and national security. The proposed funding will support three GF projects: Expansion of GF’s existing Malta, NY, fab by adding critical technologies already in production in GF’s Singapore and Germany facilities geared towards enabling the U.S. auto industry. As vehicles transition from mechanical to electronic systems, the number of semiconductor chips in each car or truck continues to soar. This expansion is key to ensuring supply chain resilience for the growing demand and to delivering for GF’s automotive customers including General Motors. This will continue to diversify GF’s flagship Malta fab into new technologies and end markets.Construction of a new state-of-art fab on the Malta campus to meet expected customer demand for U.S.-made essential chips across a broad range of markets and applications including automotive, aerospace, defense and AI. The new fab, which has already been granted some necessary permitting, will leverage the site’s existing infrastructure and ecosystem, enabling a fast and efficient path from construction to production. The semiconductor market is expected to double over the next decade, and GF’s new fab will be uniquely positioned to capture the feature-rich mature, essential chip segment which is expected to continue to represent more than 60% of the semiconductor market. Construction of this new fab combined with expansion of GF’s existing site is expected to triple the existing capacity of the Malta campus over the next 10+ years. These two projects are expected to increase wafer production to 1 million per year once all phases are complete.Modernization of GF’s longest continuously operated fab and the nation’s first and largest Trusted 200mm facility in Essex Junction, Vermont. The project will upgrade existing facilities, expand capacity as well as create the first U.S. facility capable of high-volume manufacturing of next-generation gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors for use in electric vehicles, power grids, data centers, 5G and 6G smartphones and other critical technologies. Based on market requirements and demand, GF plans to invest more than $12 billion over the next 10 plus years across its two U.S. sites through public-private partnerships with support from the federal and state governments as well as from its ecosystem partners, including key strategic customers. In support of the two Malta, New York projects, Governor Hochul today announced $575 million in planned direct funding for New York State Green CHIPS. Also announced was $15 million in planned funding for NYS Workforce Development activities for GlobalFoundries as well as $30 million in planned funding for NYS Infrastructure upgrades and Energy incentives provided by the New York Power Authority (NYPA). Combined, these investments are expected to create over 1,500 manufacturing jobs and about 9,000 construction jobs over the life of these projects. “GF is proud to announce this proposed funding from the Department of Commerce and New York State and appreciates the collaboration of the CHIPS Office and the Empire State Development Corporation throughout this process. These proposed investments, along with the investment tax credit (ITC) for semiconductor manufacturing, are central to the next chapter of the GlobalFoundries story and our industry. They will also play an important role in making the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem more globally competitive and resilient and cements the New York Capital Region as a global semiconductor hub,” said Dr. Thomas Caulfield, president and CEO of GF. “With new onshore capacity and technology on the horizon, as an industry we now need to turn our attention to increasing the demand for U.S.-made chips, and to growing our talented U.S. semiconductor workforce.” “Semiconductors are in everything from our cellphones, to refrigerators, to cars, and our most advanced weapons systems, and access to them carries important economic and national security implications. It was the shortages of semiconductors during the COVID-19 pandemic that raised prices for consumers and led to the shutdown of automobile manufacturing sites across the country,” said Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “Thanks to the CHIPS and Science Act, we're working to onshore these critical technologies in order to bolster the supply of domestic chips that are essential to manufacturing cars, electronics, and national defense systems in New York, Vermont, and states across the country.” “I have long said my CHIPS & Science Law would deliver big for New York, and I meant big with a capital ‘B.’ I am proud to announce GlobalFoundries has reached a preliminary agreement for the largest award thus far from the CHIPS program I created for $1.5 billion in grant funding. This will triple production capacity of GlobalFoundries’ already massive campus in Saratoga County, spur billions in public-private investment, and help bring thousands of new good-paying manufacturing and union construction jobs to the Capital Region,” said Senator Schumer. “When I wrote the CHIPS & Science Law, I made sure there was funding especially for the feature-rich, legacy chips that GlobalFoundries produces in Malta and that are essential for America’s auto industry and national defense. We all remember the days of the pandemic when chip shortages sky rocketed car prices and created supply chain issues leading to months-long wait times for cars and electronics, and investments like this are how we can help prevent that from happening again. Ever since GlobalFoundries’ first Fab 8 broke ground 15 years ago, I knew how significant the company would be for the Capital Region and Upstate NY. Today, the plans for their second chip facility and thousands of new good-paying jobs move forward thanks to the CHIPS & Science Law I fought hard to create.” “New York State is becoming the best place on earth to build a business,” said Governor Hochul. “Thanks to our pro-business policies, commitment to innovation and best-in-the-nation workforce, green jobs and high-tech manufacturers are flocking to the Empire State. This $11 billion investment from GlobalFoundries is a game changer, and with the partnership of the Biden administration, New York’s congressional delegation, and all of our local stakeholders, the best is yet to come.” To attract and cultivate a pipeline of semiconductor talent that will be needed in New York and Vermont, GF is creating and investing in numerous initiatives. The company recently announced a new student loan repayment program to help current employees and new recruits pay down student loan debt. The new benefit program is part of the company’s multi-million-dollar investment to strengthen the semiconductor talent workforce by helping to ease the financial burden of higher education and training of the company’s present and future employees. GF is also partnering with a broad range of universities and community colleges nationwide to help build a diverse workforce and semiconductor talent pipeline. As part of receiving CHIPS and Science Act funding, GF will continue to invest in and develop new workforce development efforts including curriculum development, internship and apprenticeship programs, K-12 STEM outreach as well as additional education and training programs. All of GF’s design and construction plans for its expansions and modernizations in New York and Vermont will reflect GF’s ongoing commitment to sustainable operations and comply with the company’s sustainability goals. Customers, government officials and academia celebrate the news from the U.S. Department of Commerce and GF: “We are pleased that GlobalFoundries will be receiving a $1.5 billion investment from the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act,” said Dr. Lisa Su, Chair and CEO of AMD. “GlobalFoundries is a strategic supplier and key enabler of AMD's high-performance computing products. The planned investment demonstrates the commitment of the U.S. government to strengthen the domestic chip supply chain for economic growth and ensure the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem.” “Semiconductors are critical to today’s vehicles,” said General Motors President Mark Reuss. “GlobalFoundries' investment in New York both ensures a robust supply of semiconductors in the U.S. to help GM meet demand and supports U.S. leadership in automotive innovation.” “Lockheed Martin is proud of our strategic partnership with GlobalFoundries to help increase access to domestically produced microelectronics – a true national security imperative,” said Jim Taiclet, chairman, president and CEO of Lockheed Martin. “The Department of Commerce’s announcement led by Secretary Raimondo will enable GlobalFoundries to continue providing essential technology to further strengthen Lockheed Martin’s secure and robust global supply chain. We look forward to the results of this announcement as part of our commitment to delivering cutting-edge 21st Century Security capabilities that advance deterrence and keep our customers ahead of emerging threats.” “Qualcomm welcomes today’s announcement from the U.S. Department of Commerce CHIPS office regarding funding for GlobalFoundries expansion of their U.S. chip making operations. GlobalFoundries’ commitment to providing additional chip production capacity that allows us to continue pushing the boundaries of the innovation for 5G, Automotive and IoT applications. We are pleased to partner with a company that shares our vision for a more resilient global supply chain for chip production,” said Dr. Roawen Chen, Chief Supply Chain and Operations Officer, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. “GlobalFoundries has been a national leader in semiconductor and chips innovation, putting Vermont at the forefront of this emerging technology. This is a well-deserved recognition of GlobalFoundries’ commitment to bolstering the on-shore growth of U.S.-made chips,” said Sen. Peter Welch. “This investment, made possible by the CHIPS and Science Act and the White House and Secretary Raimondo’s commitment to competitiveness and security, will create jobs while making our supply chains more resilient. Even more impressive, this new site will see its commitment to sustainability through with a plan to use carbon-free neutral energy practices — leading in innovation and in action.” “This is huge news for Vermont and the region,” said Governor Phil Scott. “The CHIPS Act funding will help encourage innovation and expansion of this vital sector in our state and across the country. I’m proud of the work my team has done with GF and others to assist and I want to thank the Biden Administration and our congressional delegation for their continued partnership.” “Today’s announcement is nothing short of a gamechanger for Saratoga County and the greater Capital Region. It is proof positive that our Investing in America agenda not only bolsters national security and global economic competitiveness, it can create thousands of good paying jobs right here at home. I look forward to working closely with GlobalFoundries and local, state and federal partners to make these historic plans a reality,” said Congressman Paul Tonko. “We extend our congratulations to GlobalFoundries for achieving this important milestone that will ignite regional economic growth while reinforcing the vital collaboration between Hudson Valley Community College and GF. Since 2021, through a first-of-its kind U.S. Registered Apprenticeship program, HVCC has been assisting GF in expanding its technical workforce by providing top-notch education and training to apprentices. Additional funding from CHIPS will enable us to expand our role as a critical partner in developing a highly skilled workforce for the semiconductor industry through our partnership with GlobalFoundries,” said Dr. Roger Ramsammy, president of Hudson Valley Community College. ""We congratulate GlobalFoundries on this crucial milestone. Federal investment in GF's New York manufacturing capabilities will spur regional economic development and build upon the company's longstanding and highly positive impact on the Capital region, and its investments here. This funding will further strengthen the vital partnership between SUNY and GF, allowing more SUNY students to gain experiential learning through apprenticeships and internships, and making New York the national model for education and workforce development in the semiconductor industry,"" said State University of New York Chancellor John B. King, Jr. ""The first and largest 200mm semiconductor manufacturing facility of its kind in the U.S., GF's Vermont fab is a cornerstone of the state's economy and a key partner for the University of Vermont’s work as a national research university. Through collaborative programs with UVM and other institutions in Vermont, it is a place where so many young people in our region find their future. CHIPS funding will help ensure the commercial viability of this site for years to come and enable GF and UVM to build upon our recent EDA Tech Hub designation to create internships, apprenticeships, workforce development programs, and advanced research initiatives in the Green Mountain State.

While fraud protection is crucial for individuals, lengthy ID checks can deter customers from opening accounts. Key findings include 34% prioritizing good fraud protection when opening new accounts, with biometrics being a popular security choice. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Strong fraud strategies are increasingly becoming a competitive differentiator in the financial sector. The study highlights that 34% of consumers consider good fraud protection as their primary concern when opening a new account, with a significant 73% ranking it in their top three concerns. This consumer sentiment can influence customer acquisition strategies for financial institutions. A focus on fraud protection can lead to increased customer trust and loyalty, which are key drivers for long-term business growth.However, there's a balance to be struck. With 18% of potential customers willing to abandon the account opening process if identity checks are cumbersome, financial institutions must optimize their verification processes to be both secure and user-friendly. This presents an opportunity for technology investment in areas such as biometrics, which 68% of respondents preferred, signaling a market shift towards more sophisticated security measures that enhance user experience. Financial Analyst The emphasis on fraud protection as a priority for customers can have a direct impact on the bottom line of financial institutions. As security becomes a selling point, companies that invest in advanced fraud detection and prevention technologies could see a positive effect on their market share and profitability. The potential customer attrition due to lengthy or complex ID checks—cited by one in five respondents—serves as a warning. Institutions that fail to streamline their fraud prevention measures may face increased customer acquisition costs and a higher churn rate, which can adversely affect their stock performance. Cybersecurity Expert The report underscores the importance of cybersecurity in the financial industry. With identity theft being a primary concern for customers, institutions must deploy robust cybersecurity frameworks to protect customer data. The adoption of biometrics, such as fingerprint recognition preferred by 68% of survey participants, indicates a trend towards more personal and secure authentication methods. This approach not only enhances security but also aligns with consumer preferences, potentially reducing friction in the customer experience. As cybersecurity threats evolve, financial institutions that stay ahead of the curve in protecting customer data can gain a competitive edge. 02/19/2024 - 04:15 AM Report on Fraud, Identity and Digital Banking reveals that good fraud strategies are the secret weapon to win and retain customers – as long as checks don’t take too long LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- FICO (NYSE: FICO): A new study of 1,000 UK consumers by global analytics software leader FICO1 has put the spotlight on the customer acquisition and retention advantages of strong fraud strategies. Once simply viewed as necessary overhead, according to the new research fraud departments are now the secret weapon in winning customers. Fraud protection was cited as the highest priority for individuals when choosing a provider for a new financial account. However, enhanced fraud prevention processes cannot come at any cost. One in five said they would abandon opening an account if ID checks take too long. More information: https://www.fico.com/en/latest-thinking/ebook/fraud-identity-and-digital-banking-consumer-survey-2023-united-kingdom Key findings 34% rank good fraud protection as their top consideration when opening a new account; 73% had it in their top three The type of fraud that worried Brits most is the threat of a fraudster using their identity to open an account, followed by their card being stolen and used 18% will abandon opening a current account if identity checks are too difficult or time-consuming Biometrics are a favourite security choice, with 68% preferring to use fingerprints “Financial institutions should use fraud protection as a competitive advantage,” commented James Roche, a principal fraud consultant at FICO. “Customers are looking for providers they can trust, so institutions should shout about the excellent fraud protection they provide. But when it comes to application and onboarding, they must be sure those protections, fraud checks and identity proofing are appropriate, proportionate and time-efficient to reduce the chance of dropouts.” Whilst 34% said they are more likely to open a financial account digitally than they were a year ago, the expectation for a frictionless experience has also increased. Consumers expect the application process to be fast. Almost one in five will abandon an application if the checks are too difficult or take too long. Two thirds expect to spend less than 30 minutes opening a current account. “If one place in the onboarding process sees a high proportion of dropouts, FIs should consider altering the order in which checks are made and whether some could happen once the customer has been accepted,” added Roche. The new report - Fraud, Identity and Digital Banking - reveals how the landscape has changed when it comes to identity verification. Just a few years ago biometrics was an unknown science for consumers. The FICO research shows the shift, as 54% believe fingerprint scans provide essential protection; 52% ranked face scans and 49% iris scans. However, more education is still needed on behavioural biometrics, with just 17% believing these provide excellent protection. The FICO report also identifies the financial crimes that consumers are most worried about, with identity theft to open a new account the top ranked concern at 30%. Bank account takeover was ranked the crime most feared by 20% of respondents and 16% ranked being tricked into sending money to a fraudster as the top concern. Giving customers confidence that a financial institution is using the best processes to mitigate against these threats is, therefore, critical. “Aiming for completely frictionless experiences could leave a financial institution over-exposed to fraud,” concluded Roche. “Indeed, appropriate friction can actually help customers feel protected. The reality is, checks must be proportionate and personal to each customer and interaction. Therefore, fraud protection needs to be adaptive, using all streams of customer data for the best outcome for the customer and the institution.” FICO® Platform unites core capabilities that aid detection and resolution across the customer lifecycle, including pre- and post-book. API access to third-party providers allows users to add and remove data sources as they see fit, and FICO Platform gives data science teams what they need to get their models into production.

Further value is expected to be delivered by the introduction of conservative levels of leverage through debt. Once scale has been achieved, strong cash generation is expected to support an attractive dividend policy, providing investors with a desirable mix of inflation protection, growth and income.Forward-looking StatementsThis news release contains forward‐looking information.

The application is based on results from the TROPION-Lung01 phase 3 trial, showing significant improvements in progression-free survival compared to standard care. Positive Acceptance of BLA for datopotamab deruxtecan in the U.S. for nonsquamous NSCLC treatment. Results from TROPION-Lung01 phase 3 trial led to the BLA acceptance. Statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival observed with datopotamab deruxtecan. Interim results show a favorable trend in overall survival compared to docetaxel. Safety profile consistent with previous trials, no new safety concerns identified. Potential for datopotamab deruxtecan to become the first TROP2 directed ADC for lung cancer patients. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The recent acceptance of the Biologics License Application for datopotamab deruxtecan by the FDA marks a significant milestone in the treatment of nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Given the complexity of cancer treatment and the limited options for patients with advanced stages of NSCLC, the development of new therapies is critical. Datopotamab deruxtecan, as a TROP2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC), represents an innovative approach, leveraging targeted therapy to deliver cytotoxic drugs directly to cancer cells, potentially reducing systemic toxicity. From a clinical perspective, the improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) is a promising outcome, indicating a delay in disease progression. Although the overall survival (OS) data are not yet statistically significant, the trend towards benefit is encouraging. The safety profile's consistency with previous trials suggests a manageable risk profile, which is of utmost importance for patients already burdened with treatment side effects. Medical Research Analyst The TROPION-Lung01 phase 3 trial's results are pivotal for the potential approval of datopotamab deruxtecan. The trial's dual primary endpoints, PFS and OS, are standard measures of efficacy in oncology clinical trials. The statistically significant PFS improvement over docetaxel positions datopotamab deruxtecan favorably against the current standard of care. However, investors and stakeholders should remain cautious until the final OS results are available, as regulatory approval and market adoption can be significantly influenced by these outcomes. Furthermore, the parallel submission for breast cancer treatment and additional global submissions indicate a strategic approach to expanding the drug's market presence. The potential approval in multiple indications could lead to a substantial increase in the addressable patient population, which is a critical factor for the financial performance of Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca. Market Research Analyst The acceptance of datopotamab deruxtecan's BLA by the FDA is indicative of its potential market impact. NSCLC accounts for a significant proportion of lung cancer cases and nonsquamous NSCLC represents a considerable segment within this category. As such, the introduction of a new treatment option could disrupt existing treatment paradigms and capture market share. The market will be closely monitoring the PDUFA date set for December 20, 2024, as approval could lead to rapid commercialization efforts. It's important to note that the competitive landscape includes other pharmaceutical companies developing targeted therapies for NSCLC. The market's reception of datopotamab deruxtecan will depend on its comparative efficacy, safety profile and pricing strategy in relation to these competitors. Additionally, the ongoing regulatory discussions and submissions for other indications suggest a long-term strategy for growth and diversification of the product portfolio, which could have a positive impact on the company's stock performance and market valuation. 02/19/2024 - 02:00 AM Application based on results from the TROPION-Lung01 phase 3 trial If approved, Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s datopotamab deruxtecan may be the first TROP2 directed antibody drug conjugate for patients with lung cancer TOKYO & BASKING RIDGE, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and AstraZeneca’s (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) Biologics License Application (BLA) for datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) has been accepted in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have received prior systemic therapy. Datopotamab deruxtecan is a specifically engineered TROP2 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being jointly developed by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) action date for its regulatory decision, is December 20, 2024. The BLA is based on results from the pivotal TROPION-Lung01 phase 3 trial presented at a Presidential Symposium at the European Society for Medical Oncology (#ESMO23) 2023 Congress. In the trial, datopotamab deruxtecan demonstrated a statistically significant improvement for the dual primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) compared to docetaxel, the current standard of care, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated with at least one prior line of therapy. For the dual primary endpoint of overall survival (OS), interim results numerically favored datopotamab deruxtecan over docetaxel in the overall population, however, results did not reach statistical significance at the time of data cut-off. In patients with nonsquamous NSCLC, datopotamab deruxtecan showed a clinically meaningful PFS benefit and a numerically favorable OS trend. The trial is ongoing and OS will be assessed at final analysis. The safety profile of datopotamab deruxtecan was consistent with that observed in other ongoing trials with no new safety concerns identified. “Today’s news is an important step forward in our goal of creating new standards of care that have the potential to transform the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “We are encouraged by the FDA's acceptance of the BLA as we endeavor to make datopotamab deruxtecan the first TROP2 directed antibody drug conjugate approved to treat patients with nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer after disease progression on prior systemic therapy. We look forward to working closely with the FDA to bring datopotamab deruxtecan to patients.” “Datopotamab deruxtecan has the potential to offer patients with previously treated advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer an effective and tolerable alternative to conventional chemotherapy,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “With regulatory discussions ongoing around the world and a parallel submission underway in the U.S. in breast cancer, this is only the beginning of our efforts to make this novel treatment available to patients as quickly as possible.” A parallel BLA for datopotamab deruxtecan based on results from the pivotal TROPION-Breast01 phase 3 trial is pending acceptance in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2 negative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) breast cancer. Additional regulatory submissions for datopotamab deruxtecan in lung and breast cancer are underway globally. About TROPION-Lung01 TROPION-Lung01 is an ongoing global, randomized, multicenter, open-label phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of datopotamab deruxtecan versus docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with and without actionable genomic alterations previously treated with at least one prior line of therapy. Patients with actionable genomic alterations were previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and an approved targeted therapy. Patients without known actionable genomic alterations were previously treated, concurrently or sequentially, with platinum-based chemotherapy and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. The dual primary endpoints of TROPION-Lung01 are PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) and OS. Key secondary endpoints include investigator-assessed PFS, objective response rate, duration of response, time to response, disease control rate as assessed by both BICR and investigator, and safety. TROPION-Lung01 enrolled approximately 600 patients in Asia, Europe, North America and South America. For more information visit ClinicalTrials.gov. About Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Nearly 250,000 lung cancer cases were diagnosed in the U.S. in 2023.1 NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 80% of cases.1 Approximately 70% and 30% of NSCLC tumors are of nonsquamous or squamous histology, respectively.2 While immunotherapy and targeted therapies have improved outcomes in the first-line setting, most patients eventually experience disease progression and receive chemotherapy.3,4,5 For decades, chemotherapy has been the last treatment available for patients with advanced NSCLC, despite limited effectiveness and known side effects.3,4,5 TROP2 is a protein broadly expressed in the majority of NSCLC tumors.6 There is currently no TROP2 directed ADC approved for the treatment of lung cancer.7,8 About Datopotamab Deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is an investigational TROP2 directed ADC.

The agreement includes the intent to purchase 10 Lilium Jets, as well as a future strategic collaboration on the establishment of an eVTOL operation network across the Philippines and other Southeast Asia countries, such as Cambodia. As part of the agreement, Lilium and PhilJets will partner to develop a future service, including the joint definition of routes, city pairs, and passenger demand for an on-demand eVTOL service in the region. Both companies will also identify potential sites, requirements, and partners for landing infrastructure, including the identification of vertiport partners in the region, sharing vertiport specifications and access to Lilium’s existing network of charging hardware providers. The Lilium Jet is purpose built to meet the transportation challenges of the Philippines. As a country with more than 7,500 islands, Lilium’s approach for regional air mobility is a perfect fit for eVTOL service in the Philippines and showcases the broader opportunities for island nations across the globe. PhilJets currently operates a fleet comprising 15 private jets and helicopters, with plans to expand further in the next three years, and for over a decade has been a mainstay in the Philippines aviation sector. PhilJets currently operates both private and commercial flights, together with a maintenance services affiliate entity supporting over 100 helicopters. By bringing together PhilJets’ ASEAN market expertise and Lilium’s innovative eVTOL technology, this collaboration is set to redefine regional air mobility across the region. The Philippines and Cambodia are poised for success in aviation decarbonization, with both capital cities currently undergoing development of new major airports in both Bulacan and Phnom Penh. With the Lilium Jet, designed to offer leading capacity, low noise, and high performance with zero operating emissions, Lilium and PhilJets are planning to bring high-speed regional air mobility to Southeast Asia. Thierry Tea, Chairman, PhilJets, said: “Our team is proud to collaborate with Lilium on the mission to transform the Philippine´s mobility with eVTOLs. With its growing economy, geography and important tourism industry, the Philippines is a great match to the Lilium Jet´s capabilities.

TAGRISSO® (osimertinib) with the addition of chemotherapy approved in the US for patients with EGFR-mutated advanced lung cancer,2024-02-17T03:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"AstraZeneca's TAGRISSO with chemotherapy has been approved in the US for EGFRm NSCLC treatment based on FLAURA2 results, showing significant PFS improvement. The addition of chemotherapy reduced the risk of disease progression by 38% compared to monotherapy.","TAGRISSO® (osimertinib) with the addition of chemotherapy approved in the US for patients with EGFR-mutated advanced lung cancer Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary AstraZeneca's TAGRISSO with chemotherapy has been approved in the US for EGFRm NSCLC treatment based on FLAURA2 results, showing significant PFS improvement. The addition of chemotherapy reduced the risk of disease progression by 38% compared to monotherapy. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The approval of TAGRISSO in combination with chemotherapy represents a significant advancement in the treatment of EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. The extension of median progression-free survival by nearly 9 months is a substantial improvement, considering the aggressive nature of metastatic NSCLC. This combination therapy could enhance the quality of life for patients by delaying the progression of the disease, which is a critical factor in oncology where treatment options that prolong life are highly valued.From a medical perspective, the hazard ratio of 0.62 indicates a 38% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death, which is clinically meaningful. This data suggests that the combination therapy could become a new standard of care, potentially replacing TAGRISSO monotherapy in certain patient populations. The integration of this treatment into clinical practice will require oncologists to balance the increased efficacy with the potential for added side effects from chemotherapy. Market Research Analyst The approval of TAGRISSO plus chemotherapy could lead to a significant market share increase for AstraZeneca in the NSCLC treatment space. Given that the majority of lung cancer cases are NSCLC and a significant portion of these are EGFR-mutated, the addressable market for this therapy is considerable. With over 200,000 annual diagnoses in the US alone, the potential patient base is substantial.Furthermore, the improved progression-free survival rates are likely to resonate well with healthcare providers, payers and patients, potentially driving higher adoption rates. AstraZeneca's strategic positioning could be strengthened by this FDA approval, especially if long-term survival benefits are observed, which would further differentiate TAGRISSO from competitors. Market analysts will closely monitor the uptake of this combination therapy and its impact on AstraZeneca's revenue and market valuation. Financial Analyst The FDA's Priority Review and subsequent approval of TAGRISSO in combination with chemotherapy is a positive catalyst for AstraZeneca's financial outlook. The improvement in median progression-free survival is a strong selling point that can lead to increased sales volume. It's important to assess how this approval might affect AstraZeneca's revenue streams, particularly in the oncology segment.Analysts should evaluate the potential market penetration rate and pricing strategy for the combination therapy, as well as the impact on AstraZeneca's overall market share in cancer treatments. Investors will be interested in the short-term revenue boost and the long-term implications for growth, especially considering the high incidence of NSCLC. It's also vital to consider the competitive landscape and how rivals may respond to this new treatment option. 02/16/2024 - 10:00 PM Approval based on FLAURA2 results which showed TAGRISSO plus chemotherapy extended median progression-free survival by nearly 9 months vs. standard of care WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AstraZeneca’s TAGRISSO® (osimertinib) with the addition of chemotherapy has been approved in the US for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The approval following a Priority Review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was based on the results from the FLAURA2 Phase III trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine. TAGRISSO with the addition of chemotherapy reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 38% compared to TAGRISSO monotherapy which is the 1st-line global standard of care (hazard ratio [HR] 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49-0.79; p<0.0001). Median progression-free survival (PFS) by investigator assessment was 25.5 months for patients treated with TAGRISSO plus chemotherapy, an 8.8-month improvement versus TAGRISSO monotherapy (16.7 months). PFS results from blinded independent central review (BICR) were consistent with the results by investigator assessment, showing 29.4 months median PFS with TAGRISSO plus chemotherapy, a 9.5-month improvement over TAGRISSO monotherapy (19.9 months) (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.48-0.80; p=0.0002). Each year in the US, there are over 200,000 people diagnosed with lung cancer, and 80-85% of these patients are diagnosed with NSCLC, the most common form of lung cancer.1-3 Approximately 70% of people are diagnosed with advanced NSCLC.4 Additionally, about 15% of NSCLC patients in the US have an EGFR mutation.5 Pasi A. Jänne, MD, PhD, medical oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and principal investigator for the trial, said: “This approval based on the unprecedented data from FLAURA2 brings a critical new treatment option to patients with advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. Now, with the choice of two highly effective osimertinib-based options, physicians can better tailor treatment to an individual’s needs and help ensure the best possible outcome for each patient.” Dave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Business Unit, AstraZeneca, said: “This important new treatment option can delay disease progression by nearly nine additional months, establishing a new benchmark with the longest reported progression-free survival benefit in the 1st-line advanced setting. This approval reinforces TAGRISSO as the backbone of EGFR-mutated lung cancer treatment either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy. This news is especially important for those with a poorer prognosis, including patients whose cancer has spread to the brain and those with L858R mutations.” Laurie Ambrose, President and CEO, GO2 for Lung Cancer, said: “We are so excited to see this continued progress advancing more personalized treatment options for our community. The more we can target the right treatments for the right people at the right time, the better outcomes will be for our community – a goal we all collectively share.” Results from a prespecified exploratory analysis of patients in the FLAURA2 trial with brain metastases at baseline showed TAGRISSO plus chemotherapy reduced the risk of central nervous system (CNS) disease progression or death by 42% compared to TAGRISSO alone (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.33-1.01) as assessed by BICR. With two years of follow up, 74% of patients treated with TAGRISSO plus chemotherapy had not experienced CNS disease progression or death versus 54% of patients treated with TAGRISSO monotherapy. While the overall survival (OS) results remained immature at the second interim analysis (41% maturity), no trend towards a detriment was observed (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.57-0.97). The trial continues to assess OS as a key secondary endpoint. The safety profile of TAGRISSO with the addition of chemotherapy was generally manageable and consistent with the established profiles of the individual medicines. Adverse event (AE) rates were higher in the TAGRISSO plus chemotherapy arm, driven by well-characterized chemotherapy-related AEs. Discontinuation rates for TAGRISSO due to AEs were low in both arms of the trial (11% for TAGRISSO plus chemotherapy and 6% for monotherapy). In December 2023, TAGRISSO with the addition of chemotherapy was added to the NCCN Clinical Practical Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) as a NCCN Category 1 Other Recommended regimen for patients with NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutations based on the data from FLAURA2.6 The US regulatory submission was reviewed under Project Orbis, which provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology medicines among participating international partners. As part of Project Orbis, TAGRISSO in combination with chemotherapy is also under review by regulatory authorities in Australia, Canada, and Switzerland. Regulatory applications are also under review in several other countries based on the FLAURA2 results. TAGRISSO is approved as monotherapy in more than 100 countries including in the US, EU, China and Japan. Approved indications include for 1st-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm NSCLC, locally advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC, and adjuvant treatment of early-stage EGFRm NSCLC. Regulatory applications are under review in several countries based on the FLAURA2 results. As part of AstraZeneca’s ongoing commitment to treating patients as early as possible in lung cancer, TAGRISSO is also being investigated in the neoadjuvant setting in the NeoADAURA Phase III trial with results expected later this year, and in the early-stage adjuvant resectable setting in the ADAURA2 Phase III trial. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION There are no contraindications for TAGRISSO Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis occurred in 4% of the 1813 TAGRISSO-treated patients; 0.4% of cases were fatal. In the FLAURA2 study, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 3.3% of the 276 patients who received TAGRISSO in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy; 0.4% of cases were fatal. Withhold TAGRISSO and promptly investigate for ILD in patients who present with worsening of respiratory symptoms which may be indicative of ILD (eg, dyspnea, cough and fever). Permanently discontinue TAGRISSO if ILD/pneumonitis is confirmed Heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation occurs in TAGRISSO-treated patients. Of the 1813 TAGRISSO monotherapy-treated patients in clinical trials, 1.1% were found to have a QTc >500 msec, and 4.3% of patients had an increase from baseline QTc >60 msec. Of the 276 patients treated with TAGRISSO in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy in the FLAURA2 study, 1.8% were found to have a QTc >500 msec, and 10.5% of patients had an increase from baseline QTc >60 msec. No QTc-related arrhythmias were reported. Conduct periodic monitoring with ECGs and electrolytes in patients with congenital long QTc syndrome, congestive heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or those who are taking medications known to prolong the QTc interval. Permanently discontinue TAGRISSO in patients who develop QTc interval prolongation with signs/symptoms of life-threatening arrhythmia Cardiomyopathy occurred in 3.8% of the 1813 TAGRISSO-treated patients; 0.1% of cardiomyopathy cases were fatal. In the FLAURA2 study, cardiomyopathy occurred in 9% of the 276 patients who received TAGRISSO in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy; 1.1% of cardiomyopathy cases were fatal. A decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥10% from baseline and to <50% LVEF occurred in 4.2% of 1557 patients who had baseline and at least one follow-up LVEF assessment. In the ADAURA study, 1.5% (5/325) of TAGRISSO-treated patients experienced LVEF decreases ≥10% from baseline and a drop to <50%. In the FLAURA2 study, 8% (21/262) of patients treated with TAGRISSO in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy, who had baseline and at least one follow-up LVEF assessment, experienced LVEF decreases ≥10% and a drop to less than 50%. For patients receiving TAGRISSO monotherapy, conduct cardiac monitoring in patients with cardiac risk factors, including assessment of LVEF at baseline and during treatment. For patients receiving TAGRISSO in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy, conduct cardiac monitoring in all patients, including assessment of LVEF at baseline and during treatment. Assess LVEF in patients who develop relevant cardiac signs or symptoms during treatment. For symptomatic congestive heart failure, permanently discontinue TAGRISSO Keratitis was reported in 0.6% of 1813 patients treated with TAGRISSO monotherapy in clinical trials. Promptly refer patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of keratitis (such as eye inflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity, blurred vision, eye pain and/or red eye) to an ophthalmologist Postmarketing cases consistent with erythema multiforme major (EMM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients receiving TAGRISSO. Withhold TAGRISSO if EMM, SJS, or TEN is suspected and permanently discontinue if confirmed Postmarketing cases of cutaneous vasculitis including leukocytoclastic vasculitis, urticarial vasculitis, and IgA vasculitis have been reported in patients receiving TAGRISSO. Withhold TAGRISSO if cutaneous vasculitis is suspected, evaluate for systemic involvement, and consider dermatology consultation. If no other etiology can be identified, consider permanent discontinuation of TAGRISSO based on severity Aplastic anemia has been reported in patients treated with TAGRISSO in clinical trials (0.06% of 1813) and postmarketing. Some cases had a fatal outcome. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of aplastic anemia including but not limited to, new or persistent fevers, bruising, bleeding, and pallor. If aplastic anemia is suspected, withhold TAGRISSO and obtain a hematology consultation. If aplastic anemia is confirmed, permanently discontinue TAGRISSO. Perform complete blood count with differential before starting TAGRISSO, periodically throughout treatment, and more frequently if indicated Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating TAGRISSO. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TAGRISSO and for 6 weeks after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception for 4 months after the final dose Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from TAGRISSO, women should not breastfeed during treatment with TAGRISSO and for 2 weeks after the final dose. Most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were: TAGRISSO monotherapy: leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, diarrhea, rash, musculoskeletal pain, neutropenia, nail toxicity, dry skin, stomatitis, and fatigue TAGRISSO in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, rash, diarrhea, stomatitis, nail toxicity, dry skin, and increased blood creatinine INDICATIONS [TAGRISSO is indicated as adjuvant therapy after tumor resection in adult patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test] [TAGRISSO is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test] [TAGRISSO is indicated in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test] [TAGRISSO is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation-positive NSCLC, as detected by an FDA-approved test, whose disease has progressed on or after EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy] Please see complete Prescription Information, including Patient Information for TAGRISSO. You may report side effects related to AstraZeneca products by clicking here Notes Lung cancer Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, accounting for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths.7 Lung cancer is broadly split into NSCLC and small cell lung cancer.2 The majority of all NSCLC patients are diagnosed with advanced disease.4 Patients with EGFRm NSCLC are particularly sensitive to treatment with an EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) which blocks the cell-signaling pathways that drive the growth of tumor cells.8 FLAURA2 FLAURA2 is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, global Phase III trial in the 1st-line treatment of patients with locally advanced (Stage IIIB-IIIC) or metastatic (Stage IV) EGFRm NSCLC. Patients were treated with TAGRISSO 80mg once daily oral tablets with the addition of chemotherapy (pemetrexed (500mg/m2) plus cisplatin (75mg/m2) or carboplatin (AUC5)) every three weeks for four cycles, followed by TAGRISSO with pemetrexed maintenance every three weeks. The trial enrolled 557 patients in more than 150 centers across more than 20 countries, including in the US, Europe, South America and Asia. The primary endpoint is PFS. The trial is ongoing and will continue to assess the secondary endpoint of OS. TAGRISSO® TAGRISSO® (osimertinib) is a third-generation, irreversible EGFR-TKI with proven clinical activity in NSCLC, including against CNS metastases. TAGRISSO (40mg and 80mg once-daily oral tablets) has been used to treat more than 800,000 patients across its indications worldwide and AstraZeneca continues to explore TAGRISSO as a treatment for patients across multiple stages of EGFRm NSCLC. There is an extensive body of evidence supporting the use of TAGRISSO in EGFRm NSCLC. TAGRISSO is the only targeted therapy to improve patient outcomes in both early-stage disease in the ADAURA Phase III trial and late-stage disease in the FLAURA Phase III trial and FLAURA2 Phase III trial. The Company is also researching ways to address tumor mechanisms of resistance through the SAVANNAH and ORCHARD Phase II trials, and the SAFFRON Phase III trial, which test TAGRISSO plus savolitinib, an oral, potent and highly selective MET TKI, as well as other potential new medicines. AstraZeneca in lung cancer AstraZeneca is working to bring patients with lung cancer closer to cure through the detection and treatment of early-stage disease, while also pushing the boundaries of science to improve outcomes in the resistant and advanced settings. By defining new therapeutic targets and investigating innovative approaches, the Company aims to match medicines to the patients who can benefit most. The Company’s comprehensive portfolio includes leading lung cancer medicines and the next wave of innovations, including TAGRISSO and IRESSA (gefitinib); IMFINZI (durvalumab) and IMJUDO (tremelimumab-aclt); ENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) and datopotamab deruxtecan in collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo; ORPATHYS (savolitinib) in collaboration with HUTCHMED; as well as a pipeline of potential new medicines and combinations across diverse mechanisms of action. AstraZeneca is a founding member of the Lung Ambition Alliance, a global coalition working to accelerate innovation and deliver meaningful improvements for people with lung cancer, including and beyond treatment. AstraZeneca in oncology AstraZeneca is leading a revolution in oncology with the ambition to provide cures for cancer in every form, following the science to understand cancer and all its complexities to discover, develop and deliver life-changing medicines to patients. The Company’s focus is on some of the most challenging cancers. It is through persistent innovation that AstraZeneca has built one of the most diverse portfolios and pipelines in the industry, with the potential to catalyze changes in the practice of medicine and transform the patient experience. AstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer care and, one day, eliminate cancer as a cause of death.

The company warns against false statements by Mr. Yi Zhang and associates. Legal actions taken to restrain unauthorized actions by certain individuals. Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert The events described surrounding YS Biopharma's EGM reflect significant governance challenges and legal disputes within the company. The rejection of director nominations and subsequent legal actions, such as the injunction order from the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, indicate a contentious internal environment that may impact investor confidence. The legal ramifications of such disputes can often lead to delays in implementation of company strategies and potential costs associated with litigation. Furthermore, the company's public dispute with Mr. Yi Zhang and the contested EGM results suggest a potential for ongoing instability in leadership, which can affect strategic decisions and the company's direction.From a governance perspective, the denial of entry to the EGM for certain directors also raises questions about adherence to the company's Articles of Association and general corporate governance principles. This situation could lead to scrutiny from regulatory bodies and might necessitate further legal clarification. Investors will need to monitor the situation closely, as the final outcome of these disputes could have a material effect on the company's operations and its stock performance. Financial Analyst The upheaval in YS Biopharma's boardroom is likely to influence market perception and could have a tangible effect on the company's stock price. The uncertainty generated by such a significant shift in governance, especially when combined with the issuance of injunctions against the newly elected directors, may lead to volatility in the company's shares. Investors typically prefer stability and clear direction, which seems to be at risk here.Moreover, the company's focus on the development of vaccines and therapeutic biologics for infectious diseases and cancer is an area that requires consistent and focused investment in research and development. Any diversion of resources towards resolving internal disputes could potentially slow down product development pipelines, affecting future revenue streams. The market will be observing how these governance issues are resolved and what implications they may have for the company's long-term growth prospects. Market Research Analyst In the biopharmaceutical industry, company leadership and the strategic decisions they make are critical to the success of ongoing research and the commercialization of new therapies. The dispute at YS Biopharma could signal a shift in company strategy or a disruption in its operational execution. Stakeholders will be interested in understanding the implications for the company's product pipeline, particularly in light of the competitive landscape.Investors often look at management stability as a key indicator of a company's ability to execute on its business plan. The current situation at YS Biopharma may raise concerns about the company's future direction, especially if the leadership conflict results in a change in the company's strategic priorities. Given the high costs and long timelines associated with bringing biopharmaceutical products to market, any perceived instability at the executive level can have a disproportionate impact on the company's valuation and market position. 02/16/2024 - 08:20 PM GAITHERSBURG, Md., Feb. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- YS Biopharma Co., Ltd.

Banco Itaú Chile Announces cancellation of ADS registration with the SEC,2024-02-19T22:11:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"BANCO ITAÚ CHILE (ITAUCL) announces the cancellation of its American Depositary Shares (ADS) registration with the SEC, completing the termination process initiated in October 2023. The common shares will remain registered in the Securities Registry and continue to be traded on the Santiago Stock Exchange and the Chilean Electronic Exchange.","Banco Itaú Chile Announces cancellation of ADS registration with the SEC Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary BANCO ITAÚ CHILE (ITAUCL) announces the cancellation of its American Depositary Shares (ADS) registration with the SEC, completing the termination process initiated in October 2023. The common shares will remain registered in the Securities Registry and continue to be traded on the Santiago Stock Exchange and the Chilean Electronic Exchange. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The cancellation of the registration of Banco Itaú Chile's ADS with the SEC is a significant financial event that may have various implications for the bank's liquidity and international investor base. From a financial standpoint, the termination of the ADS program could suggest a strategic pivot towards the bank's domestic market and operations. This move might be interpreted as a way to streamline operations and reduce the regulatory burden associated with SEC reporting requirements. However, it could also limit the bank's access to a broader range of international investors and potentially narrow the liquidity of its shares.It is important to consider the cost-benefit analysis that led to this decision. The costs of compliance with SEC regulations can be substantial and if the trading volume and interest in the ADS were low, it might not justify the expenses. Additionally, the bank will continue to be listed on the Santiago Stock Exchange, which could mitigate some of the potential negative impacts on liquidity. Investors should closely monitor the bank's future financial disclosures for any changes in its capital structure or funding strategies that may arise from this decision. Market Research Analyst The termination of Banco Itaú Chile's ADS program reflects a broader trend where some international companies are delisting from U.S. exchanges. This could be due to the increasing complexity of regulatory compliance, shifts in market strategies, or a focus on consolidating investor bases within their primary markets. For the Chilean banking sector, this move may signal a more localized approach to capital markets, potentially affecting how Chilean banks engage with international investors.Market participants should assess the potential impact on the bank's valuation, as the perceived accessibility and attractiveness to foreign investors might change. Furthermore, the bank's decision to maintain its presence on the Chilean exchanges indicates a commitment to its local market, which could have implications for its domestic competitive positioning. Stakeholders should also consider the potential for similar moves by other firms in the region, which could influence the overall dynamics of capital flows and foreign investment in Latin America. Legal Expert The legal implications of Banco Itaú Chile's ADS cancellation involve a release from the reporting obligations imposed by the SEC. This decision will affect the legal framework within which the bank operates, particularly in terms of disclosure and compliance. The bank's adherence to the regulatory deadlines highlights its commitment to regulatory compliance, even in the process of delisting. For the bank, this could mean a reduction in legal and administrative costs related to SEC filings.It is also essential to consider the legal ramifications for current ADS holders, as they will no longer have the protections and transparency afforded by SEC oversight. This shift requires careful communication with shareholders and adherence to Chilean regulations to maintain trust and uphold the bank's reputation in the financial community. The bank's continued registration in the Chilean Securities Registry ensures it remains under the purview of local regulations, which may differ from those of the SEC in terms of reporting standards and investor protections. 02/19/2024 - 05:11 PM SANTIAGO, Chile, Feb. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BANCO ITAÚ CHILE (SSE: ITAUCL) (the “Company”) today announces that it filed a Material Event Notice with the Chilean Commission for the Financial Market (Comisión para el Mercado Financiero) announcing that, on February 18, 2024, the cancellation of the registration of the American Depositary Shares (“ADS”) issued by the Bank with the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States of America (“SEC”) has become effective, and the reporting obligations of the Bank before said entity were terminated.

(OTC: FUNN) published financials results for the quarter ending December 31, 2023. The following update provides a brief summary to shareholders and the investment community. FUNN Q2 FY 2024 Report Business Highlights (All numbers in USD): Gross Revenue of $2,293,505 USD (Slight increase YoY Quarterly)Gross Profit of $1,740,957 USD (Slight increase YoY Quarterly)FY2024 cumulative revenue $4,309,325 (Slight increase YoY cumulative)Common Stock Outstanding of 795,493,000 (unchanged)COGS are on target hitting just below 25%. The Company wants to maintain this as this is appreciable given COGS are decreasing while revenues are increasingAccount Receivable grew from ~$113,000 to ~$132,000 reflecting healthy activity of Corporate Events over the holidays (B to B activity)The Company beat the previous FY Q2 by 15% on Hospitality revenues (location growth)Cash on hand at the end of the quarter slightly decreased to $64,432 with total assets of $3,716,681.No convertible debt instruments into future equity of the company were issued.Tradeable public float is 527,923,441, as of December 31st, 2023. (This is cumulative throughout the entire trading history dating back to 1985 with no recapitalizations or reverse splits throughout the entire, going on 39-year history of the Company.) The Company is pleased with the growing revenue trend, and are on track for the company objective of $10 M+ USD in revenues for FY 2024 as we continue to strengthen our corporate level fiscal position. Hospitality revenue alone has been on a solid overall positive growth trend for the last 10 quarters since emerging from the pandemic. Over the past year, the Company has removed over $2 million in debt / liabilities from the books resulting in 5 convertible notes remaining. These remaining notes are all associated with the acquisition and renovation of the Snakes & Lattes Inc. Tucson location. All notes are at a fixed price much higher than current market trading prices. The oldest of those remaining notes was recently repurchased by the Company to avoid conversion and any dilution to shareholders. (Note: The note holders are friendly and supporters of the Company) Dilution for any company is a concern, but the potential conversion rate had a significantly higher fixed conversion rate. This helps confirm to shareholders the stock is not seeing high dilution. There were no stock issuances in the quarter, or any convertible notes written to assure stockholders that preservation of shareholder value, combined with the growth of the underlying business is of utmost importance to the Company. The Company has mostly used traditional financing to expand operations over the years. The most recent brick and mortar location, now known as Snakes & Lattes Inc., Virginia Beach was an almost all cash acquisition. The previous quarter Q1 FY 24 was our best Q1 of all time (excluding logistics activities 2018-2019) with hospitality up 14% FY Q over Q. COGS went down 12% overall with the last rolling 4 quarters being our top 4 quarters for revenues. Looking forward: The Company looks forward to announcing future updates to the shareholders and investment community at large throughout calendar 2024 as we strive to capitalize on what we have built over the past years. The Company continues to grow revenues over time, and the trend is now years long. All key business indicators are positive growth oriented. The Company hopes to capitalize on a number of growth initiatives in 2024 and beyond and will be excited to share news with everyone as milestones are crossed or pertinent information becomes available. There are always new avenues being explored and look forward to making some of them a reality. As always, a big thanks to all our shareholders, supporters, loyal guests, and staff.

The site's yearly consumption of 36,000 megawatt hours is equivalent to powering nearly 5,000 homes, marking one of RTX's largest renewable energy projects. Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Sustainability Analyst Transitioning to 100% renewable electricity is a significant step for any manufacturing operation, particularly in the aerospace industry where the environmental impact is a growing concern. The move by Collins Aerospace's facility in Tanauan City to source its energy from a geothermal power plant demonstrates a commitment to sustainability that could have a ripple effect throughout the supply chain. This shift not only reduces the site's carbon footprint by an estimated 25,000 metric tons annually but also aligns with global trends of increased environmental responsibility.From an investor's perspective, this proactive approach to sustainability may enhance the company's reputation and potentially lead to increased market share as customers and partners increasingly favor environmentally conscious suppliers. Additionally, the long-term cost savings from renewable energy sources can improve financial performance by reducing energy expenses over time. However, the initial investment and transition costs must be considered, as they could impact short-term financials. Energy Sector Analyst The adoption of renewable energy, particularly geothermal, by a significant player in the aerospace sector like Collins Aerospace, is indicative of broader shifts in the energy market. Geothermal energy is reliable and less variable than other renewable sources such as wind or solar, offering a consistent power supply crucial for manufacturing operations. This strategic choice may position RTX as a leader in industrial renewable energy adoption, potentially influencing competitors and partners to follow suit.For stakeholders, the emphasis on renewable energy can be seen as a mitigation strategy against volatile fossil fuel prices and potential regulation risks associated with carbon emissions. It's important to note that geothermal energy's availability is geographically dependent, which may limit replication of this specific strategy across all RTX facilities.

(NYSE: JELD) reported fourth quarter and full-year 2023 results, highlighting a decrease in net revenues but an increase in Adjusted EBITDA. The company also provided guidance for 2024, expecting flat to a 7% decline in Core Revenues. Despite challenges, JELD-WEN aims to enhance financial results through productivity improvements and cost reduction initiatives. Positive Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased by $31.6 million to $380.4 million in full year 2023, with a margin increase of 110 basis points to 8.8%. Net revenues from continuing operations decreased by 5.3% in 2023 to $4,304.3 million, driven by a 5% decline in Core Revenue. JELD-WEN reported a net loss from continuing operations of $(22.6) million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to net income of $25.9 million in the same period last year. The company expects 2024 net revenues of $4.0 to $4.3 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of $370 to $420 million, anticipating potential volume declines in the coming year. JELD-WEN plans to increase capital expenditures to approximately 4% of sales in 2024 and incur non-recurring cash expenses of around $100 million to improve financial performance. Negative - Despite an increase in Adjusted EBITDA, JELD-WEN experienced a decrease in net revenues for both the fourth quarter and full year 2023. - The company's Core Revenue declined due to lower volume/mix, impacting overall financial results. - JELD-WEN anticipates uncertain market conditions in 2024, posing challenges for revenue generation and profitability. Financial Analyst The reported net loss from continuing operations and the decline in core revenue for JELD-WEN in Q4 2023 are notable indicators of the company's performance challenges in a tough macroeconomic landscape. The decreased net revenues and lower volume/mix suggest a contraction in demand or possible loss of market share. However, the increase in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin signifies effective cost management and pricing strategies that have helped in improving profitability despite revenue headwinds.For investors, the full-year guidance for 2024 presents a cautious outlook, reflecting flat to potentially declining core revenues. This could signal to the market that the company does not anticipate a quick recovery in demand or market conditions. The commitment to invest in capital expenditures and non-recurring cash expenses indicates a strategic move to enhance long-term financial health, but it may also imply near-term cash flow pressures. Market Research Analyst The performance of JELD-WEN must be contextualized within the broader building products industry, which has been experiencing fluctuations due to shifts in construction trends and the economic cycle. The company's price realization gains suggest a competitive pricing power, which can be critical for maintaining margins in an industry characterized by commoditized products. However, the significant volume/mix decline raises questions about the company's market positioning and its ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences or construction activity levels.Looking ahead, the company's focus on productivity improvements and cost reduction initiatives will be essential in maintaining its competitive edge, especially in the face of continued market uncertainty. The planned increase in capital expenditures to 4% of sales is an indication of JELD-WEN's investment in future growth, possibly through technological advancements or expansion of product lines. Economist The financial results of JELD-WEN can be seen as a microcosm of the economic headwinds that have been affecting the manufacturing sector, including rising input costs and supply chain disruptions. The company's ability to improve its Adjusted EBITDA Margin in spite of these challenges is a testament to its operational efficiency and cost control measures. However, the lower volume/mix could be indicative of broader economic slowdowns affecting consumer spending and investment in housing and infrastructure.The full-year 2024 guidance suggests a conservative approach, likely factoring in ongoing economic uncertainties such as interest rate hikes, inflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions. The company's strategic investments and cost management efforts are crucial in navigating these macroeconomic challenges while preparing for eventual market recovery. 02/19/2024 - 04:30 PM CHARLOTTE, N.C., Feb. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- JELD-WEN Holding, Inc.

The forward-looking statements included in this release are made as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Non-GAAP Financial Information This press release presents certain ""non-GAAP"" financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, Adjusted EBITDA Margin from continuing operations, Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations, Adjusted EPS from continuing operations, Free Cash Flow, and Net Debt Leverage. The components of these non-GAAP measures are computed by using amounts that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP""). A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release to their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables at the end of this press release. The Company provides certain guidance solely on a non-GAAP basis because the Company cannot predict certain elements that are included in certain reported GAAP results. While management is not able to provide a reconciliation of items for forward-looking non-GAAP measures without unreasonable effort, management bases the estimated ranges of non-GAAP measures for future periods on its reasonable estimates of certain items such as assumed effective tax rate, assumed interest expense, and other assumptions about capital requirements for future periods. Although the Company believes the assumptions reflected in the range of its 2024 guidance are reasonable, actual results could vary substantially given the uncertainty regarding the future performance of the global economy, ongoing geopolitical conflicts, disruptions in supply chains, and changes in raw material prices and other costs as well as other risks and uncertainties, including those described below. In addition, the guidance ranges provided for 2024 do not include the impact of potential acquisitions or divestitures. The variability of these items may have a significant impact on our future GAAP results. Other companies may compute these measures differently. The non-U.S. GAAP information has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for U.S. GAAP information. It does not purport to represent any similarly titled U.S. GAAP information and is not an indicator of our performance under U.S. GAAP. We present several financial metrics in ""Core"" terms, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures completed in the last twelve months. We define Core Revenue as net revenue excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and acquisitions and divestitures completed in the last twelve months. The use of ""Core"" metrics assists management, investors, and analysts in understanding the organic performance of the operations. We use Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, Adjusted EBITDA Margin from continuing operations, Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations, and Adjusted EPS because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and Adjusted EBITDA Margin from continuing operations are helpful in highlighting trends because they exclude certain items outside the control of management, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, and capital investments. We use Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and Adjusted EBITDA Margin from continuing operations to measure our financial performance in reporting our results to our Board of Directors. Further, our executive incentive compensation is based in part on Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance or to cash flows from operations as a liquidity measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax, adjusted for the following items: income tax expense (benefit); depreciation and amortization; interest expense, net; and certain special items consisting of non-recurring net legal and professional expenses and settlements; goodwill impairment; restructuring and asset related charges; other facility closure, consolidation, and related costs and adjustments; M&A related costs; net (gain) loss on sale of property and equipment; loss on extinguishment of debt; share-based compensation expense; pension settlement charges; non-cash foreign exchange transaction/translation (income) loss; and other special items. Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations represents net income from continuing operations adjusted for the after-tax impact of certain special items used to calculate Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as described above. Where applicable, the specifically identified items are tax effected at the applicable jurisdictional tax rate and tax expense is adjusted to remove the effect of discrete tax items. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations represents net income from continuing operations per diluted share adjusted to exclude the estimated per share impact of the same specifically identified items used to calculate Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations as described above. Adjusted EBITDA Margin from continuing operations represents Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as a percentage of net revenues. We present Free Cash Flow because we believe this metric assists investors and analysts in determining the quality of our earnings. Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash (used in) provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (including purchases of intangible assets). Free Cash Flow should not be considered as an alternative to net cash (used in) provided by operating activities as a liquidity measure. We also present Net Debt Leverage because it is a key financial metric that is used by management to assess the balance sheet risk of the Company. We define Net Debt Leverage as Net Debt (total principal debt outstanding less unrestricted cash) divided by Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the last twelve month period. Due to rounding, numbers presented throughout this release may not sum precisely to the totals provided and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures. JELD-WEN Holding, Inc.

Such a track record can be a strong signal to investors about the reliability of the company as an income-generating investment.Moreover, consistent dividend growth can potentially attract a certain class of income-seeking investors, particularly those who are retirees or conservative investors looking for steady income streams. It's imperative to analyze the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the price per share, to understand the attractiveness of the dividend in relation to the current stock price. Investors should also consider the payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders, to assess the sustainability of the dividend payments. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Pentair's dividend increase can be seen as a positive signal, potentially leading to a favorable perception among analysts and investors. It suggests that the company is confident in its future earnings and cash flow, enough to share profits with its shareholders regularly. The psychological impact of a rising dividend can also contribute to investor confidence, as it may be perceived as a sign of a company's resilience and optimistic outlook.However, it's important to contextualize this dividend announcement within the broader industry and economic environment. Factors such as interest rate trends, inflation and overall market conditions can influence the attractiveness of dividend stocks. In a low-interest-rate environment, for instance, dividend stocks can become more appealing as they offer better returns than many fixed-income alternatives. Conversely, in a high-interest-rate environment, the opportunity cost of holding dividend stocks increases, which could impact their demand. 02/19/2024 - 04:19 PM LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pentair plc (NYSE: PNR) announced today that it will pay a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share on May 3, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 19, 2024. 2024 marks the 48th consecutive year that Pentair has increased its dividend.

The company will pay $1,018.97 per $1,000 principal amount of the notes accepted for purchase. CNX also issued a conditional notice to redeem all notes not purchased in the offer. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The tender offer and subsequent redemption of CNX Resources Corporation's 7.250% Senior Notes due 2027 represent a strategic financial move that can have significant implications for the company's capital structure and interest expense. By repurchasing a majority of these high-interest notes before their maturity, CNX is likely aiming to reduce its long-term debt obligations and associated interest costs. This could improve the company's net interest margin by decreasing the amount of income that is used to service debt. The purchase price of $1,018.97 per $1,000 principal amount indicates a premium over par value, which is a common occurrence in tender offers intended to incentivize holders to sell back their securities.Additionally, the conditional redemption of remaining notes not purchased in the tender offer suggests that CNX is confident in the success of its new notes offering, which is expected to provide the necessary funds to complete the redemption. The redemption price of 101.813% also represents a premium, which could be viewed as an effort to manage the company's debt profile efficiently. If the new notes offering is at a lower interest rate, it would further indicate a refinancing strategy to take advantage of current market conditions, potentially lowering the cost of capital and enhancing shareholder value in the long term.Investors and analysts will be closely monitoring the completion of the tender offer and the new notes offering, as they could affect CNX's leverage ratios and overall financial health. A successful refinancing at lower interest rates could be a positive signal to the market, potentially impacting the company's stock price and credit rating. Market Research Analyst The strategic financial activities of CNX Resources Corporation, specifically in the context of their tender offer and planned redemption, can be seen as a proactive approach to capital management in the energy sector. The energy market, particularly for natural gas, is subject to volatility due to factors such as fluctuating commodity prices, regulatory changes and shifts in supply and demand dynamics. CNX's decision to manage its debt in this manner could be perceived as an effort to strengthen its financial position against such market uncertainties.By retiring the 7.250% Senior Notes, CNX may also be signaling to the market its commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet, which is often a key factor in investor confidence. The ability to execute such financial maneuvers can be indicative of a company's operational efficiency and financial agility, which are critical competencies in the competitive energy industry. The repurchase and retirement of debt at a premium could reflect positively on the company's creditworthiness and may lead to more favorable borrowing terms in the future.Moreover, CNX's description as an 'ultra-low carbon intensive natural gas development' company aligns with the growing investor interest in environmentally responsible energy production. This focus on sustainability could attract ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) investors, potentially broadening the company's investor base and supporting its stock valuation. Legal Expert In the context of the tender offer and the conditional redemption, it is important to consider the legal implications and adherence to regulatory requirements. The cautionary statement provided by CNX Resources Corporation highlights the regulatory framework in which such financial transactions take place. The company's careful wording to clarify that the press release does not constitute an offer to purchase or sell securities is a standard practice to comply with securities laws and avoid the dissemination of misleading information.The conditional nature of the redemption is also noteworthy from a legal perspective. It is contingent upon the successful closing of the new notes offering and the receipt of net proceeds, which introduces a degree of uncertainty. The possibility of rescinding the redemption notice if conditions are not met underscores the importance of the terms outlined in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes. Such conditions are designed to protect both the company and the note holders, ensuring that the redemption is executed only if it aligns with the company's financial strategy and capabilities.Legal experts would also consider the implications of the new notes offering and its compliance with securities regulations. Ensuring that the offering is conducted in accordance with the laws of relevant jurisdictions is critical to avoid regulatory sanctions and maintain the company's reputation in the financial markets. 02/19/2024 - 04:15 PM PITTSBURGH, Feb. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- CNX Resources Corporation (NYSE: CNX) (""CNX"") today announced the final results and expiration of its previously announced cash tender offer (the ""Tender Offer"") to purchase any and all of the $350 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 7.250% Senior Notes due 2027 (the ""2027 Notes""). As of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on February 16, 2024, the expiration time for the Tender Offer (the ""Expiration Time""), CNX had received tenders for an aggregate principal amount of $312,227,000 of the outstanding 2027 Notes, or 89.21% of the aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes outstanding. These amounts exclude any 2027 Notes that may be tendered pursuant to the guaranteed delivery procedures described in the Offer to Purchase and the Notice of Guaranteed Delivery (each as defined below). The Tender Offer was made pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the Offer to Purchase, dated February 12, 2024 (the ""Offer to Purchase""), and the related notice of guaranteed delivery for the Tender Offer (the ""Notice of Guaranteed Delivery""). In accordance with the terms of the Tender Offer, CNX will pay the purchase price (the ""Purchase Price"") for the 2027 Notes validly tendered prior to the Expiration Time or pursuant to the Notice of Guaranteed Delivery on February 23, 2024 (the ""Settlement Date"").

For avoidance of doubt, interest on the 2027 Notes will cease to accrue on the Settlement Date for all 2027 Notes accepted in the Tender Offer. All 2027 Notes purchased on the Settlement Date will subsequently be retired. Concurrently with the commencement of the Tender Offer, CNX issued a conditional notice, pursuant to the indenture governing the 2027 Notes, to redeem (the ""Redemption"") all 2027 Notes not purchased in the Tender Offer, at a redemption price of 101.813% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date of March 14, 2024 (the ""redemption date""). The Redemption is conditioned on the closing of CNX's contemporaneous offering of new senior notes (the ""new notes offering"") and its receipt of net proceeds from such offering, and there can be no assurance the Redemption will be completed. The Redemption may be terminated and the redemption notice may be rescinded in the event such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date. CNX retained J.P. Morgan Securities LLC to serve as the Lead Dealer Manager and TD Securities (USA) LLC to serve as the Dealer Manager for the Tender Offer. Global Bondholder Services Corporation served as the tender agent and information agent for the Tender Offer. CNX Resources Corporation (NYSE: CNX) is a premier, ultra-low carbon intensive natural gas development, production, midstream, and technology company centered in Appalachia, one of the most energy abundant regions in the world. With the benefit of a 160-year regional legacy, substantial asset base, leading core operational competencies, technology development and innovation, and astute capital allocation methodologies, we responsibly develop our resources and deploy free cash flow to create long-term per share value for our shareholders, employees, and the communities where we operate.

B&G Foods Announces Tax Treatment of Common Stock Dividends Paid in 2023,2024-02-19T21:55:00.000Z,Low,Very Positive,"B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS) has provided details on the tax treatment for dividends paid in 2023 on the Company’s common stock.

Shareholders are advised to review their tax statements and consult tax advisors for individual tax treatment.","B&G Foods Announces Tax Treatment of Common Stock Dividends Paid in 2023 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS) has provided details on the tax treatment for dividends paid in 2023 on the Company’s common stock. The company distributed $0.76000 per share, all treated as a return of capital, with no taxable dividends. Shareholders are advised to review their tax statements and consult tax advisors for individual tax treatment. Positive None. Negative None. Tax Advisor The classification of B&G Foods' distributions as a return of capital rather than taxable dividends has significant implications for investors. Primarily, a return of capital reduces an investor's cost basis in the stock, which could defer taxes until the stock is sold. This is in contrast to dividends, which are typically taxed in the year they are received. The deferral of tax liability may be advantageous for investors seeking to optimize their tax positions. However, once the adjusted basis of the stock reaches zero, any further return of capital distributions would be taxed as capital gains.Investors need to be aware that the reclassification can affect their investment strategy, particularly if they rely on dividend income for cash flow. In such cases, the lack of taxable dividends might necessitate a reassessment of portfolio yields and cash flow expectations. Moreover, this treatment underscores the importance of accurate record-keeping for tax purposes, as it directly impacts capital gains calculations upon the sale of the stock. Financial Analyst From a financial analysis standpoint, the shift to return of capital indicates that B&G Foods is not generating enough taxable income to cover its dividend payments. This could be a red flag for the company's financial health and sustainability of its dividend policy. Investors and analysts should closely examine the company's earnings and cash flow statements to assess the underlying reasons for this tax treatment.Furthermore, the market's reaction to such news can be mixed. While some investors may appreciate the tax-efficient nature of return of capital, others may be concerned about the company's long-term profitability and ability to generate income. It is essential to monitor the stock's performance and investor sentiment following the announcement, as it may provide insights into market perceptions of the company's financial trajectory. Market Research Analyst In the context of the broader food industry, companies often strive for a balance between returning value to shareholders and reinvesting in the business for growth. The announcement by B&G Foods should be analyzed against industry benchmarks and peer performance. If B&G Foods' approach deviates significantly from its peers, it could suggest strategic differences or signal a unique financial situation.It is also critical to understand the competitive landscape and how B&G Foods' financial strategies might affect its market position. For instance, if the return of capital is a result of strategic asset sales or cost-cutting measures, it could have implications for the company's long-term competitive advantages and operational capabilities. 02/19/2024 - 04:55 PM PARSIPPANY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- B&G Foods, Inc.

The Company's AI-based weapons detection technology deployed at over 650 customers across various sectors, identifying hundreds of firearms daily. Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert The initiation of an investigation by the SEC into Evolv Technology is a significant development that could have material implications for the company's operations and its investors. From a legal standpoint, the nature of these inquiries is to gather information and determine whether there have been any violations of federal securities laws. The SEC's statement that the investigation should not be construed as an indication of any wrongdoing is standard, yet the market often reacts negatively to such announcements due to the uncertainty they introduce.For stakeholders, the short-term implications include potential volatility in the company's stock price as investors digest the news and consider the possible outcomes. In the long-term, should the investigation uncover any legal issues, the company may face penalties, which could include fines or more stringent regulatory oversight, potentially affecting its financial health and market reputation. Moreover, the company's proactive approach to transparency and its decision to publicly disclose the investigation might be seen as a positive step in managing its public relations. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the announcement of an SEC investigation into Evolv Technology can impact investor sentiment and the company's market value. The company's emphasis on the robustness of its customer base and the widespread adoption of its technology is an attempt to mitigate market concerns and reassure stakeholders of its operational solidity. The detail that Evolv's technology has been used to screen over 1 billion visitors and identifies hundreds of firearms daily underscores the company's market penetration and operational efficacy.However, the investigation could potentially deter new customers or partnerships, especially in sectors like education and healthcare that are sensitive to regulatory compliance and public perception. The company's stock price may reflect the increased risk profile until the investigation's findings are made public and any uncertainties are resolved. The mention of the company's experienced team is intended to reassure investors of the company's competence in navigating this challenge. Financial Analyst Financially, the SEC's investigation into Evolv Technology presents a risk that must be carefully monitored by current and potential investors. The company's financial performance could be indirectly affected if the investigation leads to a loss of customer confidence or disruptions in operations. It is crucial to evaluate the company's financial resilience and the robustness of its balance sheet to withstand any potential legal or regulatory costs that may arise.Investors will also be attentive to the company's forthcoming financial disclosures to assess any material changes in its financial condition that may be attributable to the SEC's investigation. The ability of the company to continue its growth trajectory in light of these events will be a key factor for long-term financial performance. It's important to analyze the company's historical financials, cash flow and any contingencies it may have in place for legal proceedings to understand its capacity to navigate through this period. 02/19/2024 - 04:01 PM WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Evolv Technology (NASDAQ: EVLV), the leading security technology company pioneering AI-based weapons detection to create safer experiences, today provided an update on a request received from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Specifically, on Friday, February 16, 2024 the SEC notified the Company it was initiating an investigation that was described as a confidential “non-public, fact finding inquiry.” The Company notes the SEC’s explicit guidance that the investigation “should neither be construed as an indication by the Commission or its staff that any violation of law has occurred, nor as a reflection upon any person, entity, or security.” The Company is eager to cooperate with the SEC as it is with any regulatory body. The Company was contacted by a representative of the media within hours of receiving the SEC’s confidential notice seeking comment on an SEC matter. In the interest of transparency, the Company has decided to disclose the matter publicly considering attempts by certain media outlets to discredit the Company and manipulate the customer markets the Company serves. Evolv stands behind its technology and is proud to partner with hundreds of security professionals to add a layer of advanced technology to their safety plan. The Company’s technology is deployed at over 650 customers across many markets including education, healthcare, professional sports, industrial workplaces, houses of worship and tourist attractions. Prior to purchasing Evolv products, key customer decision makers – many whom often have years of security and technology expertise – typically conduct their own extensive testing in their actual operating environment. Based on these successful testing and validation outcomes, Evolv Express has now been used to screen over 1 billion visitors and is used to identify hundreds of firearms every day across the Company’s rapidly growing customer base. The Company’s team includes security professionals who have served in leadership positions in the Central Intelligence Agency, Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Defense, New York Police Department, Office of National Intelligence, Transportation Security Administration, and United States Secret Service. About Evolv Technology Evolv Technology (NASDAQ: EVLV) is transforming human security to make a safer, faster, and better experience for the world’s most iconic venues and companies as well as schools, hospitals, and public spaces, using industry leading artificial intelligence (AI)-powered weapons detection and analytics. Its mission is to transform security to create a safer world to work, learn, and play.

In addition, just as he will do in Springfield, Chris has managed major network affiliates across multiple television stations in Waco and Twin Falls, and his recent large-market experience will be a real asset in this new role. Throughout his career, Chris has been successful by connecting to viewers and advertisers with the kind of local content that is both relevant and meaningful, and I am confident he will do the same in Springfield.” Commenting on his move to Springfield, Mr. Pruitt stated, “I have thoroughly enjoyed my nearly four years in Houston, and I’m proud of everything the team at KIAH CW39 accomplished—they are the best. I am just as happy to be joining our broadcast and digital teams in Springfield, and look forward to forging a deep relationship with the community. I am grateful to Nexstar for giving me this opportunity and I can’t wait to get started.” Mr. Pruitt has been involved in the media industry throughout his career and has served on the FOX Network Sales Advisory Committee. He has also been committed to each of the individual communities in which he has lived, working with the Houston Food Bank and the Periwinkle Foundation, which assists children with cancer and other debilitating illnesses.

(CVR) declares a regular quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share, payable on March 20, 2024, to shareholders of record on March 5, 2024.","CHICAGO RIVET & MACHINE CO. DECLARES DIVIDEND Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Negative) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Chicago Rivet & Machine Co. (CVR) declares a regular quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share, payable on March 20, 2024, to shareholders of record on March 5, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a regular quarterly dividend by Chicago Rivet & Machine Co. indicates a stable financial position and a commitment to returning value to shareholders. Dividends are often a sign of a company's confidence in its current profitability and future earnings potential. The specified dividend of ten cents per share may seem nominal, but it is essential to look at the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the stock price. This metric helps investors understand the return on investment from dividends alone.Investors typically view regular dividends as a positive signal, potentially leading to increased investor confidence and a more favorable view of the company's stock. However, it is also crucial to assess the payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders. A payout ratio that is too high can be unsustainable in the long term, whereas a lower payout ratio may indicate that the company is reinvesting more of its profits into growth opportunities. Market Research Analyst From a market research perspective, the dividend declaration by Chicago Rivet & Machine Co. should be evaluated in the context of the industry average and the company's historical dividend patterns. If the dividend amount represents an increase, decrease, or a consistent trend, this can signal the company's operational health and strategic priorities to the market.Additionally, the market's reaction to such news can be influenced by broader economic conditions. For instance, in a low-interest-rate environment, dividend-paying stocks can become more attractive to income-seeking investors. Conversely, during periods of high-interest rates, investors may favor growth stocks or other income-generating assets. Thus, the timing and size of dividend payments can impact investor sentiment and the stock's performance. 02/19/2024 - 01:41 PM NAPERVILLE, Ill., Feb. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- On February 19, 2024 the Board of Directors of Chicago Rivet & Machine Co.

Operating income and net income show significant increases, along with a rise in adjusted EBITDA. The company also declares a 12% increase in quarterly cash dividend. The outlook for 2024 projects continued growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Positive Strong financial results for HealthStream, Inc. (HSTM) in Q4 2023 and full-year 2023. Q4 2023 revenues increased by 3% to $70.6 million compared to Q4 2022. Operating income for Q4 2023 was $4.3 million, up 38% from Q4 2022. Net income in Q4 2023 rose by 87% to $4.6 million. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2023 increased by 17% to $16.0 million. Full-year 2023 revenues were up 5% to $279.1 million compared to 2022. Operating income for full-year 2023 increased by 29% to $16.0 million. Net income for full-year 2023 rose by 26% to $15.2 million. Adjusted EBITDA for full-year 2023 increased by 15% to $61.3 million. A 12% increase in quarterly cash dividend declared by the Board of Directors. 2024 outlook projects revenue between $292.0 - $296.0 million and adjusted EBITDA between $64.5 - $67.5 million. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent financial results of HealthStream, Inc. indicate a positive trend in the company's performance, with a 3% increase in fourth quarter revenues and a 5% increase in full-year revenues. Notably, the 38% rise in operating income and 87% surge in net income for Q4, along with a 29% and 26% increase respectively for the full year, demonstrate a robust improvement in profitability. The growth in net income is particularly impressive, nearly doubling from the previous year's quarter, which may reflect operational efficiencies and successful strategic initiatives.From a financial analysis perspective, the company's capitalization of labor for software development suggests a strategic investment in technology to drive future growth, although it's important to note that this also leads to higher amortization expenses. The declaration of a quarterly cash dividend, with a 12% increase, could be seen as a signal of confidence in HealthStream's financial health and a commitment to delivering shareholder value.Looking ahead, the company's 2024 guidance indicates a continued positive trajectory. However, investors should consider the potential impact of external economic factors, such as inflationary pressures and the fact that the guidance does not account for possible acquisitions or changes in the value of minority investments. These factors could introduce variability to the forecasted outcomes. Market Research Analyst HealthStream's performance can be partially attributed to its strategic focus on the healthcare technology sector, which is experiencing growth due to increasing demand for digital solutions. The expansion into the nursing education market and the development of the hStream platform are strategic moves that broaden the company's addressable market and enhance its product ecosystem.The Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) model adopted by HealthStream is becoming increasingly popular in the healthcare industry, as it allows for scalability and interoperability between different applications and services. The reported 5.79 million contracted subscriptions to hStream highlight the platform's adoption and potential for recurring revenue streams. The introduction of e-commerce capabilities, targeting direct sales to healthcare professionals, represents a diversification of sales channels, which could further drive revenue growth.It's important to monitor the competitive landscape and the adoption rates of new products and services. The company's ability to innovate and adapt to the evolving needs of healthcare providers will be critical for maintaining its growth momentum. Legal Expert The financial report includes a discussion on non-GAAP financial measures, specifically adjusted EBITDA. It is crucial for stakeholders to understand that these measures exclude certain expenses and income that are included in the most comparable GAAP measures. While management believes that adjusted EBITDA provides a more reflective measure of the company's operating performance, it is essential to recognize that these are not standardized measures and may not be directly comparable to similar metrics reported by other companies.The company's early adoption of ASU 2021-08 has implications for how contracts acquired in acquisitions are treated. This accounting update allows the company to avoid write-downs of deferred revenue to fair value, which historically has impacted reported revenue and net income. By adjusting for these write-downs in their adjusted EBITDA, HealthStream aims to provide a clearer picture of the underlying performance post-acquisition. Stakeholders should be aware of these accounting practices when evaluating the company's financial health and future prospects. 02/19/2024 - 04:30 PM NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- HealthStream, Inc. (the ""Company"") (Nasdaq: HSTM), a leading healthcare technology platform for workforce solutions, announced today results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Revenues of $70.6 million, up 3% from $68.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 Operating income of $4.3 million, up 38% from $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 Net income of $4.6 million, up 87% from $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 Earnings per share (EPS) of $0.15 per share (diluted), up from $0.08 per share (diluted) in the fourth quarter of 2022 Adjusted EBITDA1 of $16.0 million, up 17% from $13.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.028 per share, an increase of 12% over the previous quarter’s dividend of $0.025 per share Full-Year 2023 Revenues of $279.1 million, up 5% from $266.8 million in 2022 Operating income of $16.0 million, up 29% from $12.4 million in 2022 Net income of $15.2 million, up 26% from $12.1 million in 2022 Earnings per share (EPS) of $0.50 per share (diluted) in 2023, compared to $0.39 per share (diluted) in 2022 Adjusted EBITDA of $61.3 million, up 15% from $53.4 million in 2022 1 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income and disclosure regarding why we believe adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors is included later in this release. Financial Results: Fourth Quarter 2023 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2022 Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by $2.1 million, or three percent, to $70.6 million, compared to $68.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Subscription revenues increased $2.6 million, or four percent, and professional services revenues declined by $0.5 million. Operating income was $4.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, up 38% from $3.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The improvement in operating income was primarily attributable to the growth in revenues, a reduction in labor costs, and an increase in labor capitalized for software development activities. Partially offsetting these improvements were higher costs for software, cloud hosting, sales commissions, and bad debt, and an increase in amortization associated with capitalized software. Other income during the fourth quarter of 2023 included a $0.4 million gain associated with the sale of a company in which we owned a minority equity interest. Net income was $4.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, up 87% from $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, and EPS was $0.15 per share (diluted) in the fourth quarter of 2023, up from $0.08 per share (diluted) for the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $16.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, up 17 percent from $13.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. At December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $71.1 million. Capital expenditures incurred during the fourth quarter of 2023 were $7.2 million. Full-Year 2023 Compared to Full-Year 2022 For 2023, revenues were $279.1 million, an increase of five percent from revenues of $266.8 million for 2022. Operating income for 2023 increased by 29 percent to $16.0 million, compared to $12.4 million for 2022. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to higher revenues and an increase in capitalized labor associated with software development activities. Operating income was also impacted by higher amortization, software, cloud hosting, commissions, royalties, travel, and bad debt expenses, as well as severance charges incurred during 2023 in connection with the Company’s restructuring under a single platform strategy. Net income for 2023 was $15.2 million, compared to $12.1 million for 2022. Earnings per share were $0.50 per share (diluted) for 2023, compared to $0.39 per share (diluted) for 2022. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 15 percent to $61.3 million for 2023, compared to $53.4 million for 2022. Other Business Updates As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 5.79 million contracted subscriptions to hStream, our Platform-as-a-Service technology, which characterizes our single platform approach. By establishing interoperability, the hStream platform enables healthcare organizations and their respective workforces to easily connect to and gain value from the growing HealthStream ecosystem of applications, tools, and content. On September 13, 2023, the Company announced a share repurchase program approved by the Company's Board of Directors under which the Company is authorized to repurchase of up to $10.0 million of its outstanding shares of common stock. Pursuant to this authorization, the Company has repurchased shares valued at $8.9 million through December 31, 2023, with $6.8 million repurchased during the fourth quarter. The share repurchase program is scheduled to terminate on the earlier of March 31, 2024 or when the maximum dollar amount has been expended. The share repurchase program does not require the Company to acquire any amount of shares and may be suspended, discontinued, or terminated at any time. On February 19, 2024, the Board approved a quarterly cash dividend under the Company's dividend policy of $0.028 per share, reflecting an increase of 12% over the previous quarter’s dividend of $0.025 per share. The dividend is payable on March 22, 2024 to holders of record on March 11, 2024. Financial Outlook for 2024 The Company is providing guidance for 2024 for the measures set forth below, including adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined later in this release. For a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA to projected net income (the most comparable GAAP measure) for 2024, see the table included on page nine of this release. Full-Year 2024 Guidance Low High Revenue $ 292.0 - $ 296.0 million Adjusted EBITDA1 $ 64.5 - $ 67.5 million Capital Expenditures $ 28.0 - $ 30.0 million 1 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA to projected net income (the most comparable GAAP measure) is included later in this release. The Company’s guidance for 2024 as set forth above reflects the Company’s assumptions regarding, among other things, expectations for new sales and renewals, and assumes that general economic conditions, including inflationary pressures, do not deteriorate. This consolidated guidance does not include the impact of any acquisitions that we may complete during 2024, gains or losses from changes in the fair value of minority investments, or impairment of long-lived assets. Commenting on fourth quarter & full-year 2023 results, Robert A. Frist, Jr., Chief Executive Officer, HealthStream, said, “Our financial performance for full-year 2023 was strong. Compared to the prior year, in 2023 our revenues were up five percent, adjusted EBITDA was up 15 percent, operating income was up 29 percent, and net income was up 26 percent. Based on our projections and guidance, I believe we will set new records again in 2024.” “In 2023, we expanded our addressable market to include the nation’s nursing schools and their one million nursing students. Powered by advances in our hStream platform, we also launched new e-commerce capabilities, enabling us to make direct sales to physicians, nurses, and nursing students—where we saw early positive results. These exciting developments attest to the unique value proposition that HealthStream is delivering to customers.” A conference call with Robert A. Frist, Jr., Chief Executive Officer, Scott A. Roberts, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, and Mollie Condra, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, will be held on Tuesday, February 20, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. (ET).

A replay of the conference call and webcast will be archived on the Company’s website in the Investor Relations section under “Events & Presentations.” Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release presents adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure used by management in analyzing the Company’s financial results and ongoing operational performance. In order to better assess the Company’s financial results, management believes that net income excluding the impact of the deferred revenue write-downs associated with fair value accounting for acquired businesses (as discussed in greater detail below) and before interest, income taxes, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, and changes in fair value of, including gains (losses) on the sale of, non-marketable equity investments (“adjusted EBITDA”) is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company because adjusted EBITDA reflects net income adjusted for certain GAAP accounting, non-cash and/or non-operating items which we believe, in any such case, are not fully reflective of the underlying operating performance of our business. We also believe that adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors to assess the Company’s ongoing operating performance and to compare the Company's operating performance between periods. In addition, short-term cash incentive bonuses and certain performance-based equity awards are based on the achievement of adjusted EBITDA (as defined in applicable bonus and equity grant documentation) targets. As noted above, the definition of adjusted EBITDA includes an adjustment for the impact of the deferred revenue write-downs associated with fair value accounting for acquired businesses. Prior to the Company early adopting ASU 2021-08 effective January 1, 2022, following the completion of any acquisition by the Company, the Company was required to record the acquired deferred revenue at fair value as defined in GAAP, which typically resulted in a write-down of the acquired deferred revenue. When the Company was required to record a write-down of deferred revenue, it resulted in lower recognized revenue, operating income, and net income in subsequent periods. Revenue for any such acquired business was deferred and was typically recognized over a one-to-two-year period following the completion of any particular acquisition, so our GAAP revenues for this one-to-two-year period would not reflect the full amount of revenues that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was not written down to fair value. Management believes that including an adjustment in the definition of adjusted EBITDA for the impact of the deferred write-downs associated with fair value accounting for businesses acquired prior to the January 1, 2022 effective date of the Company's adoption of ASU 2021-08 provides useful information to investors because the deferred revenue write-down recognized in periods after an acquisition may, given the nature of this non-cash accounting impact, cause our GAAP financial results during such periods to not fully reflect our underlying operating performance and thus adjusting for this amount may assist in comparing the Company’s results of operations between periods. Following the adoption of ASU 2021-08, contracts acquired in an acquisition completed on or after January 1, 2022 are measured as if the Company had originated the contract (rather than the contract being measured at fair value) such that, for such acquisitions, the Company no longer records deferred revenue write-downs associated with acquired businesses (for acquisitions completed prior to January 1, 2022, the Company continues to record deferred revenue write-downs associated with fair value accounting for periods on and after January 1, 2022 consistent with this prior standard). Through December 31, 2023, the Company continued to include an adjustment in the definition of adjusted EBITDA for the impact of deferred revenue write-downs from business acquired prior to January 1, 2022, given the impact of such deferred revenue on our financial results. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Because adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP, adjusted EBITDA is susceptible to varying calculations. Accordingly, adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and has limitations as an analytical tool. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to net income (the most comparable GAAP measure), which is set forth below in this release.

The company aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2035 and has become a leader in green bond issuance in the U.S. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Verizon's commitment to green financing through its fifth green bond issuance is a strategic move that aligns with the growing trend of sustainable investing. The full allocation of nearly $1 billion towards Renewable Energy Purchase Agreements (REPAs) indicates a robust approach to achieving their net-zero emissions goal by 2035. This initiative can potentially enhance Verizon's reputation as a socially responsible investment, which may attract ESG-focused investors and possibly lead to a more favorable cost of capital over time.From a financial perspective, the investment in renewable energy projects could lead to operational cost savings in the long run due to lower energy prices compared to traditional sources. However, investors should be aware that the upfront capital expenditure for these projects may impact Verizon's short-term financials. The focus on renewable energy also positions Verizon to take advantage of potential tax credits and incentives, which could improve their financial performance in the coming years. Sustainability Expert The issuance of green bonds by corporations like Verizon is a critical step in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy. By allocating these funds to REPAs, Verizon is not only contributing to the development of approximately 0.9 GW of new renewable energy capacity but also influencing the wider market. The company's actions encourage the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure, which is essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Verizon's leadership in this area, being one of the largest green bond issuers in the U.S., sets a benchmark for other companies in the telecom sector and beyond. It demonstrates the feasibility and business case for large-scale investment in sustainability, which is crucial for catalyzing industry-wide change. The impact of these investments extends beyond environmental benefits, as they can also lead to job creation in the renewable energy sector and support local economies where the projects are located. Energy Sector Analyst The allocation of funds from Verizon's green bond to REPAs is a significant development for the energy sector. Renewable energy projects in the states of Illinois, Maine, North Dakota, Ohio and West Virginia are set to receive a substantial influx of capital, which is likely to accelerate the growth of renewable energy infrastructure in these regions. The nearly 0.9 GW of new generating capacity represents a meaningful addition to the United States' renewable energy portfolio.For the energy market, this move by Verizon could drive down costs for renewable energy technologies due to increased scale and potentially lead to more competitive pricing for end-users. It is also indicative of a broader shift among corporations towards long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs), which provide stability for renewable energy producers and secure low, fixed-rate energy costs for corporate buyers. As more companies follow Verizon's lead, the demand for renewable energy could significantly reshape the energy market's supply and demand dynamics. 02/19/2024 - 12:06 PM NEW YORK, Feb. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) issued its Green Bond Impact Report, outlining the full allocation of the nearly $1 billion of net proceeds from its fifth green bond, which was issued in May 2023. In February 2019, Verizon became the first U.S. telecom company to issue a green bond and remains a leader in the industry with the allocation of five green bonds. “The $5 billion of green bonds that we have issued to date are instrumental to our efforts to achieve our goal of net zero emissions in our operations by 2035,” said Tony Skiadas, Verizon’s executive vice president and chief financial officer. “As one of the leading corporate buyers of renewable energy and one of the largest green bond issuers in the U.S., we are proud to help accelerate the greening of the U.S. electrical grid as we work to meet our goals around climate protection.” As of February 16, 2024, Verizon has fully allocated the $994.1 million of net proceeds of our fifth green bond entirely to REPAs for renewable energy projects. The REPAs, including amendments to prior REPAs to make additional investments, were executed between February 2023 and January 2024. The REPAs support renewable energy projects that are under development in five states – Illinois, Maine, North Dakota, Ohio and West Virginia. The REPAs cover nearly 0.9 GW of new renewable energy generating capacity, of which about 53% is solar energy generating capacity and about 47% is wind energy generating capacity. As part of our renewable energy purchase program, Verizon has entered into 27 REPAs for a total of approximately 3.6 gigawatts (GW) of anticipated renewable energy generating capacity. These REPAs position us to exceed our target to source the equivalent of 50% of our total annual electricity consumption with renewable energy by 2025. We will continue to identify new renewable energy projects under development as we work toward our 2030 renewable energy target of 100%. Verizon’s renewable energy purchase program supports Citizen Verizon, the company’s responsible business plan for economic, environmental and social advancement. The Green Bond Impact Report can be found on the company’s investor relations site at https://www.verizon.com/about/investors/green-bond-reports. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) was formed in 2000 and is one of the world’s leading providers of technology and communications services. Headquartered in New York City and with a presence around the world, Verizon generated revenues of $134.0 billion in 2023.

TotalEnergies SE: Disclosure of Transactions in Own Shares,2024-02-19T17:00:00.000Z,Low,Very Negative,"TotalEnergies SE (TTE) announces share repurchase transactions totaling 2,798,275 shares at an average price of 59.95 EUR, amounting to 167,765,858.77 EUR, from February 12 to February 16, 2024.","TotalEnergies SE: Disclosure of Transactions in Own Shares Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary TotalEnergies SE (TTE) announces share repurchase transactions totaling 2,798,275 shares at an average price of 59.95 EUR, amounting to 167,765,858.77 EUR, from February 12 to February 16, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst A share repurchase program can be a significant indicator of a company's financial health and management's confidence in the business. TotalEnergies SE's recent buyback transaction, involving the repurchase of 2,798,275 shares at an average price of approximately 59.95 EUR per share, represents a substantial investment back into the company. This action suggests that the management believes the shares are undervalued and that investing in their own stock is a good use of capital.From a financial perspective, these buybacks can be accretive to earnings per share (EPS) by reducing the number of shares outstanding, which in turn can increase the stock price if the market perceives the buyback as a positive signal. It also reflects a return of capital to shareholders, as it may indicate that the company did not find more attractive investment opportunities to grow the business or that it is generating more cash than needed for operations and growth.However, the timing and price of the buyback are crucial. If the company repurchases shares at a price higher than their intrinsic value, it could result in a destruction of shareholder value. Additionally, investors should consider the opportunity cost of the buyback, as the funds used could have been allocated to other value-creating opportunities. Market Research Analyst Share repurchase programs are often well-received in the market as they can indicate a bullish outlook by the company's management. In the case of TotalEnergies SE, the repurchase of shares from various markets (XPAR, CEUX, TQEX, AQEU) could be interpreted as a strong signal of confidence to the market. The repurchase activity spread over multiple days and across different exchanges demonstrates a strategic approach to the buyback, possibly aimed at minimizing the impact on the share price.It is important to analyze the broader industry context to understand the potential impact of such a buyback. In the energy sector, where TotalEnergies operates, factors such as oil prices, regulatory changes and shifts towards renewable energy sources can significantly impact company valuations. The repurchase might be a move to capitalize on temporary market mispricings due to these external factors.Investors and stakeholders should monitor the company's subsequent financial statements to assess the impact of the buyback on key financial metrics and to understand how the reduction in equity affects the company's leverage and overall financial stability. Economist Share buybacks can have broader economic implications, particularly for a company the size of TotalEnergies SE. When a company of this magnitude engages in repurchasing its own shares, it can influence market liquidity and capital allocation within the economy. By reducing the number of shares available in the market, the company can potentially increase the stock's demand and price, which may have a positive feedback effect on market sentiment.However, it is essential to consider the economic context in which these buybacks occur. For instance, in a low-interest-rate environment, companies might be more inclined to finance share repurchases through debt, which could increase their financial risk. Conversely, in a high-interest-rate environment, the opportunity cost of not investing in yield-generating assets becomes more significant.The effect of such buybacks on the company's financial flexibility should also be considered. While buybacks can signal strength, they can also reduce the cash reserves that might be necessary for navigating economic downturns or for seizing strategic investment opportunities that may arise. 02/19/2024 - 12:00 PM PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News: In accordance with the authorization given by the ordinary shareholders’ general meeting on May 26, 2023, to trade on its shares and pursuant to applicable law on share repurchase, TotalEnergies SE (LEI: 529900S21EQ1BO4ESM68) (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE) declares the following purchases of its own shares (FR0000120271) from February 12 to February 16, 2024: Transaction Date Total daily volume (number of shares) Daily weighted average purchase price of shares (EUR/share) Amount of transactions (EUR) Market (MIC Code) 12/02/2024 352,890 59.848778 21,120,035.27 XPAR 12/02/2024 144,870 59.847035 8,670,039.96 CEUX 12/02/2024 28,080 59.846908 1,680,501.18 TQEX 12/02/2024 24,000 59.846419 1,436,314.06 AQEU 13/02/2024 349,867 60.283606 21,091,244.38 XPAR 13/02/2024 144,842 60.283218 8,731,541.86 CEUX 13/02/2024 27,976 60.284350 1,686,514.98 TQEX 13/02/2024 23,670 60.284767 1,426,940.43 AQEU 14/02/2024 349,419 60.383027 21,098,976.91 XPAR 14/02/2024 144,087 60.383452 8,700,470.45 CEUX 14/02/2024 28,633 60.383746 1,728,967.80 TQEX 14/02/2024 23,813 60.384632 1,437,939.24 AQEU 15/02/2024 366,159 59.364623 21,736,890.99 XPAR 15/02/2024 150,833 59.363176 8,953,925.93 CEUX 15/02/2024 30,272 59.362574 1,797,023.84 TQEX 15/02/2024 25,074 59.366310 1,488,550.86 AQEU 16/02/2024 376,488 59.918167 22,558,470.86 XPAR 16/02/2024 152,714 59.920267 9,150,663.65 CEUX 16/02/2024 29,652 59.917625 1,776,677.42 TQEX 16/02/2024 24,936 59.920144 1,494,168.71 AQEU Total 2,798,275 59.953314 167,765,858.77 Transaction details In accordance with Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 (the Market Abuse Regulation) a full breakdown of the individual trades are disclosed on the TotalEnergies website: https://totalenergies.com/investors/shares-and-dividends/total-shares/info/company-share-transactions About TotalEnergies TotalEnergies is a global multi-energy company that produces and markets energies: oil and biofuels, natural gas and green gases, renewables and electricity.

Expected to open in late 2024, the resort will offer modern luxury with personalized amenities, dynamic culinary options, and a range of activities. It will feature contemporary suites, engaging nightlife programming, curated dining options, and exclusive amenities like an Olympic-sized swimming pool and luxurious spa. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The introduction of the Destination by Hyatt brand to the Caribbean, specifically with the Cas en Bas Beach Resort in St. Lucia, represents a strategic expansion in a leisure market with significant growth potential. The resort's positioning between two award-winning golf courses and a white sand beach, coupled with its range of high-end amenities, targets affluent global travelers seeking luxury combined with unique experiences. The resort's offerings, such as personalized excursions and vibe-led fitness programs, are designed to differentiate it from traditional hotel experiences in the region.From a market perspective, the development of Cas en Bas Beach Resort aligns with the broader trend of experiential travel, where guests are looking for more than just accommodation; they seek immersive, culturally rich experiences. This trend has been driving the luxury segment of the hospitality industry and Hyatt's investment in such a property indicates a response to consumer demand. The resort's planned opening in late 2024 also suggests confidence in the post-pandemic recovery of the travel sector, particularly in high-end leisure destinations. Financial Analyst Hyatt's expansion into the Caribbean with a new luxury resort is a move that could potentially enhance the company's revenue streams and diversify its portfolio geographically. The luxury travel market is known for its higher margins and the introduction of a new property in a desirable location like St. Lucia could attract a segment of travelers willing to spend more on premium experiences. This can lead to increased average daily rates and occupancy levels, positively impacting Hyatt's bottom line.The announcement may also have implications for Hyatt's stock (NYSE: H), as investors often react to growth initiatives, particularly in emerging or underserved markets. However, the actual impact on the stock will depend on the execution of the resort's launch, its operational performance and how it contributes to Hyatt's overall financial health. It's important for investors to monitor the progress of the resort's development and the company's performance in the leisure segment over time.

The long-term success of this venture will hinge on maintaining high service standards and delivering the promised unique Caribbean lifestyle to travelers. 02/19/2024 - 11:41 AM Idyllically situated on the northern tip of St. Lucia, Cas en Bas Beach Resort will offer a distinctly modern and personalized getaway in a tropical paradise CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:H) and Wellington Estates today announced the planned debut of Cas en Bas Beach Resort, marking the introduction of the Destination by Hyatt brand in the Caribbean.

Vistra Receives Approval from Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Energy Harbor Acquisition,2024-02-19T16:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Vistra (VST) receives final regulatory approval from FERC to acquire Energy Harbor, marking a significant step towards accelerating the growth of Vistra's zero-carbon generation portfolio.","Vistra Receives Approval from Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Energy Harbor Acquisition Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Vistra (VST) receives final regulatory approval from FERC to acquire Energy Harbor, marking a significant step towards accelerating the growth of Vistra's zero-carbon generation portfolio. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Market Analyst The approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for Vistra's acquisition of Energy Harbor is a significant milestone in the energy sector. The acquisition, which includes a substantial 4,000-megawatt nuclear generation fleet and a retail business serving approximately 1 million customers, is poised to reshape Vistra's market position. The incorporation of zero-carbon nuclear assets aligns with broader industry trends towards decarbonization and enhances Vistra's competitive edge in a market increasingly driven by sustainability concerns.From an energy market perspective, the addition of nuclear generation capabilities is particularly notable. Nuclear power plants are capable of providing baseload power, which is critical for grid stability and reliability. The retail customer base expansion also indicates potential growth in Vistra's market share and revenue streams. This strategic move may prompt a reevaluation of Vistra's stock by market analysts, factoring in the anticipated increase in long-term value and the potential for economies of scale. Financial Analyst The transaction's closure following FERC approval is likely to have immediate financial implications for Vistra. The acquisition's scale suggests a considerable capital outlay and the financial structure of the deal will be critical in determining its impact on Vistra's balance sheet. Investors will be keen on understanding the financing mechanisms, whether through debt or equity and the implications for Vistra's financial leverage and credit ratings.Furthermore, the market will closely monitor the integration process for signs of operational efficiency and synergy realization. The acquisition's success will hinge on Vistra's ability to seamlessly integrate Energy Harbor's assets and customer base, which can lead to cost savings and improved profit margins. Analysts will also scrutinize the effect on Vistra's earnings per share (EPS) and whether the acquisition is accretive to shareholder value in the short to medium term. Environmental Policy Expert The acquisition's environmental implications are noteworthy. Vistra's expansion of its zero-carbon generation portfolio through the integration of nuclear assets is a strategic response to the growing regulatory and societal pressures for clean energy. Nuclear energy is a low-carbon power source that can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions relative to fossil fuel-based power generation.

The alliance focuses on technology integration, management services, and precision care in oncology, with a strong emphasis on improving patient outcomes. Positive None. Negative None. Healthcare Technology Analyst The strategic collaboration between GE HealthCare, OSF HealthCare and Pointcore, Inc. represents a significant investment in healthcare technology and digital solutions, with the potential to enhance clinical and operational efficiencies across the OSF HealthCare system. From a technology perspective, the introduction of GE HealthCare’s new version of Digital Expert Access with remote scanning is an innovative step forward in medical imaging. This FDA 510(k)-cleared device facilitates remote patient scanning on MRI devices, which could lead to reduced wait times and less care disruption.Furthermore, the focus on precision care in oncology, particularly through the development of pathways for integrated cancer care, suggests a commitment to advancing personalized medicine. This approach, leveraging advanced analytics and capital management strategies, is indicative of a trend towards data-driven healthcare solutions that can optimize both patient outcomes and resource allocation within health systems. Medical Research Analyst The alliance's emphasis on enhancing precision care, especially in oncology, is noteworthy. By identifying clinical and technological opportunities to accelerate integrated cancer care, the collaboration could significantly impact patient outcomes in diseases like prostate cancer. The use of Theranostics—a combination of therapy and diagnostics—illustrates a forward-thinking approach to cancer treatment that is increasingly being recognized for its potential to tailor therapies to individual patients.Additionally, the investment in innovation and new technology systems could lead to more effective treatments and improved diagnostic capabilities. The partnership's potential to scale personalized care and streamline capital management also suggests a model that could be replicated by other healthcare systems aiming to improve efficiency and patient care quality. Healthcare Industry Analyst The collaboration’s potential impact on the healthcare industry extends beyond the immediate stakeholders. By setting a precedent for large-scale technological integration and standardization of care delivery models, this alliance may influence how other health systems approach similar challenges. The financial implications of such a partnership are multi-faceted, as the upfront investment in new technology and systems could result in long-term savings through improved operational efficiencies and potential reductions in costly medical errors or redundant procedures.The partnership's focus on capital management innovation, particularly in a time when healthcare costs are a significant concern, could also offer a blueprint for other systems to follow. If successful, this collaboration could demonstrate the value of strategic alliances between healthcare providers and technology companies in driving both quality of care and financial sustainability. 02/19/2024 - 10:00 AM 10-year collaboration aims to expand the reach of innovative technology and digital solutions to more than one million patients.

Diluted EPS saw a significant increase, along with positive leadership insights and segment performance. The company outlines a strategic direction for 2024, focusing on growth and operational efficiency. Positive Record revenue and earnings reported for both Q4 and full year 2023. Diluted EPS increased by 226% y-o-y for the full year. Adjusted diluted EPS rose by 13% for the full year. Net revenue reached a record $1.9 billion for the full year, up by 10%. Positive leadership reflections on revenue growth and strategic efforts. Segment performance highlights growth in options, futures, and FX trading revenue. Strategic direction for 2024 includes organic revenue growth and operational efficiency. Projected capital expenditures for growth and development in 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The report by Cboe Global Markets Inc. indicates a robust financial performance, with a particularly noteworthy 226% year-on-year increase in diluted EPS for the full year of 2023. Such a surge in profitability often reflects effective cost management and potentially expanding margins, which could be indicative of a strong competitive position within the financial exchange industry. The reported 10% growth in annual net revenue, while substantial, aligns with industry growth trends, suggesting that Cboe is maintaining pace with market expansion.Investors may find the 33% increase in quarterly diluted EPS reassuring, as it implies that Cboe's profitability is not solely reliant on cyclical or one-off events but is sustained across financial periods. The record high market share in Global FX and the increase in options trading revenue by 15% highlight Cboe's strong positioning in these segments, which could be attributed to the company's strategic focus on derivatives and data and access solutions. However, the slight decrease in market share for Options exchanges may require attention to ensure long-term dominance in this core area. Market Research Analyst Analyzing Cboe's segment performance reveals nuanced dynamics within their business model. The 15% increase in revenue from options trading, driven by a 24% rise in index options trading, underscores a growing investor interest in derivative instruments, possibly linked to market volatility or the search for alternative investment strategies. Conversely, the 10% decrease in North American Equities revenue, attributed to lower transaction fees and market data revenue, could signal a competitive challenge or a shift in trading patterns. It is essential to monitor how these trends evolve, as they may impact Cboe's market positioning and revenue streams.The company's strategic direction for 2024, with an emphasis on organic net revenue growth and operational efficiency, suggests a proactive approach to scaling operations while managing costs. The projected increase in revenue from data and access solutions aligns with the industry's broader shift towards data monetization, which is becoming an increasingly critical component of exchange revenue models. Economist From an economic standpoint, Cboe's financial results and forward-looking statements provide insight into the broader financial markets' health. The company's performance, particularly in derivatives and foreign exchange, may reflect underlying economic trends such as increased market volatility, international trade flows and the global diversification of assets. The positive outlook for 2024, with anticipated organic revenue growth, suggests confidence in the continued demand for Cboe's offerings, which may be seen as a positive indicator for economic activity and liquidity in the financial markets.However, it is important to consider macroeconomic factors such as interest rate changes, regulatory developments and geopolitical events that could influence trading volumes and revenue. The effective tax rate estimation between 28.5% and 30.5% will also play a role in net earnings, as changes in tax policy can have a significant impact on financial institutions like Cboe. 02/19/2024 - 08:30 AM CHICAGO, IL / ACCESSWIRE / February 19, 2024 / Cboe Global Markets Inc. (NYSE:CBOE) reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023, showcasing significant growth in several key financial metrics. Some of the standout figures from the report include a substantial increase in diluted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted diluted EPS and net revenue for both the quarter and the full year. The biggest takeaway is the company reported record full-year revenue and earnings, while providing promising targets for 2024. Financial HighlightsQuarterly Performance: Diluted EPS for the fourth quarter rose by 33% year-on-year (y-o-y) to $1.98, with adjusted diluted EPS also increasing by 14% to $2.06.

Tomczyk highlighted the company's revenue growth, particularly from its derivatives and data and access solutions, largely attributing success to market trends and strategic efforts. He also outlined ambitions to leverage Cboe's technological and global strengths for further growth in 2024.""This year we plan to unlock additional value from our global derivatives and securities network by leveraging our core strengths - our global footprint, superior technology and product innovation - to help drive continued strong revenue growth and financial results.""

Meanwhile, the market share for Cboe's Options exchanges slightly decreased from 34.1% to 33.5%.North American Equities: Revenue in this segment dropped by 10% to $86.3 million.

Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Transocean Ltd. (RIG) reported a net loss of $104 million for Q4 2023, with adjusted net loss of $74 million. Contract drilling revenues increased to $741 million due to higher fleet revenue efficiency. Full year net loss was $954 million, with adjusted net loss of $739 million. The company added $3.2 billion of backlog in 2023. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported sequential increase in contract drilling revenues is a positive indicator of growing operational activity, likely driven by improved market conditions in the offshore drilling sector. The improvement in revenue efficiency from 95.4% to 97.0% suggests the company is optimizing its operations, which is crucial for profitability, especially in capital-intensive industries. However, the adjusted EBITDA margin decrease from 22.5% to 16.3% raises concerns about the company's ability to translate revenue growth into bottom-line results. This margin compression could be indicative of rising operational costs or other inefficiencies that are not fully offset by the revenue increase.Investors should also consider the significant capital expenditures associated with the newbuild ultra-deepwater drillship, which reflects the company's growth strategy but also adds to the financial burden in the short term. The substantial backlog of $9.01 billion provides a degree of revenue visibility, which is critical for future cash flow projections. However, the net loss figures, both quarterly and annually, highlight ongoing challenges in achieving profitability. The Effective Tax Rate fluctuations and the impact of discrete tax items should be analyzed for their potential influence on net loss figures. Market Research Analyst The offshore drilling industry is known for its cyclical nature and the CEO's statement about a multi-year upcycle suggests optimism for the sector's future. The addition of $3.2 billion to the backlog is significant as it represents future revenues that can provide stability to the company's financials. The mention of eighth-generation drillships indicates the company's investment in high-specification assets that are expected to be in demand as the industry moves towards more complex and challenging drilling environments. This strategic positioning could potentially offer a competitive advantage and attract premium contracts.Moreover, the company's focus on safety and performance, achieving a 97.6% uptime, is also noteworthy as operational excellence is a key differentiator in the industry. The emphasis on delivering value to shareholders in the context of market tightness suggests that the company is confident about its pricing power and the ability to secure profitable contracts. This could be a positive sign for investors looking at the long-term prospects of the company. Energy Sector Analyst The reported figures provide insight into the operational health of Transocean Ltd. within the energy sector, particularly offshore drilling. The increased average daily revenue and higher fleet revenue efficiency are indicative of strong operational performance and potentially higher day rates, which are vital metrics in the drilling industry. The strategic focus on ultra-deepwater assets reflects the industry trend towards deepwater and ultra-deepwater exploration and production, which is driven by the depletion of easier-to-reach oil reserves.The 20K BOP (blowout preventer) on the Deepwater Atlas represents an advancement in drilling technology, catering to high-pressure reservoirs and underscoring the company's investment in safety and innovation. The financial commitment to newbuild drillships like the Deepwater Aquila, despite the reported net losses, suggests a long-term outlook that anticipates a rebound in offshore drilling activity, aligning with the CEO's comments on market tightness and a multi-year upcycle. Stakeholders should assess the company's financial resilience and ability to manage debt levels in the context of these capital-intensive investments. 02/19/2024 - 05:21 PM Three months ended December 31, September 30, Sequential 2023 2023 change(In millions, except per share amounts and backlog) Contract drilling revenues$741 $713 $28 Adjusted contract drilling revenues$748 $721 $27 Revenue efficiency 97.0 % 95.4 % 1.6 %Operating and maintenance expense$569 $524 $45 Net loss attributable to controlling interest$(104) $(220) $116 Diluted loss per share$(0.13) $(0.28) $0.15 Adjusted EBITDA$122 $162 $(40) Adjusted EBITDA margin 16.3 % 22.5 % (6.2)%Adjusted net loss$(74) $(280) $206 Adjusted diluted loss per share$(0.09) $(0.36) $0.27 Backlog as of the February 2024 Fleet Status Report$9.01 billion STEINHAUSEN, Switzerland, Feb. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Transocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG) today reported a net loss attributable to controlling interest of $104 million, $0.13 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2023. Fourth quarter results included net unfavorable items of $30 million, $0.04 per diluted share as follows: $24 million, $0.03 per diluted share, loss on conversion of debt to equity;$5 million, $0.01 per diluted share, loss on impairment of our investment in an unconsolidated affiliate; and$3 million, discrete tax items, net. These unfavorable items were partially offset by: $1 million gain on early retirement of debt;$1 million of other net favorable items. After consideration of these net unfavorable items, fourth quarter 2023 adjusted net loss was $74 million, $0.09 per diluted share. Contract drilling revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2023 increased sequentially by $28 million to $741 million due to increased average daily revenue and higher fleet revenue efficiency, as well as increased utilization on four rigs that were undergoing contract preparation and one rig that underwent a special periodic survey in the third quarter. This was partially offset by lower revenue generated by two rigs that were idle and two rigs that were undergoing contract preparation during the fourth quarter. Contract intangible amortization represented a non-cash revenue reduction of $7 million, compared to $8 million in the prior quarter. Operating and maintenance expense was $569 million, compared with $524 million in the prior quarter. The sequential increase was primarily due to rigs returning to work after undergoing contract preparation in the prior quarter and higher in-service maintenance costs across our fleet, partially offset by lower activity for two rigs that were idle in the fourth quarter. After consideration of the fair value adjustment of the bifurcated exchange feature embedded in our 4.625% exchangeable bonds, which was favorable $145 million in the fourth quarter and unfavorable $93 million in the third quarter, interest expense net of amounts capitalized was $142 million, compared with $139 million in the prior period. Interest income was $10 million, compared with $12 million in the previous quarter. The Effective Tax Rate(2) was (25.0)%, down from 16.3% in the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily due to reduced losses in the current quarter. The Effective Tax Rate excluding discrete items was (30.0)% compared to (8.7)% in the previous quarter. Cash provided by operating activities was $98 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, representing an increase of $142 million compared to the prior quarter. The sequential increase was primarily due to timing of interest payments and increased collections from customers partially offset by decreased cash collected from, and increased payments to, our unconsolidated affiliates. Fourth quarter 2023 capital expenditures of $220 million were primarily associated with the newbuild ultra-deepwater drillship Deepwater Aquila. This compares with $50 million in the prior quarter. “We are very proud of our performance in 2023,” said Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Thigpen. “We added $3.2 billion of backlog in the calendar year, providing additional visibility to future cash flows. In addition to delivering standout personal and process safety results, we finished the year with a company-best 97.6% uptime performance. Notably, we generated these results in a year that included eight large-scale projects, including installation of the 20K BOP on the Deepwater Atlas, the industry’s first eighth-generation drillship, and the timely delivery and commissioning of the Deepwater Titan, our second eighth-generation drillship. Finally, we took delivery of our eighth 1,400 short ton drillship, the Deepwater Aquila.” Thigpen concluded: “We remain encouraged by the continued tightness in the market and remain focused on delivering value to our shareholders as we progress through what we expect to be a multi-year upcycle.” Full Year 2023 For the year ended December 31, 2023, net loss attributable to controlling interest totaled $954 million, $1.24 per diluted share. Full year results included $215 million, $0.28 per diluted share, net unfavorable items listed as follows: $169 million, $0.22 per diluted share, loss on disposal of assets;$57 million, $0.07 per diluted share, loss on impairment of assets;$31 million, $0.04 per diluted share, loss on retirement of debt;$27 million, $0.04 per diluted share, loss on conversion of debt to equity; and$5 million, $0.01 per diluted share, loss on impairment of our investment in an unconsolidated affiliate; partially offset by,$74 million, $0.10 per diluted share, related to favorable discrete tax items. After consideration of these net unfavorable items, adjusted net loss for 2023 was $739 million, $0.96 per diluted share.

(NYSE: ALIT) released its 2024 Company Payroll Complexity Report highlighting payroll penalties for non-compliance. The report shows 53% of companies faced penalties in the last five years, with many still using spreadsheets and outdated processes. Despite media focus on AI, only 8% plan to integrate AI in the next two years. Positive None. Negative - Low adoption of AI in payroll processes despite industry trends and media attention. - Significant percentage of companies still using spreadsheets and outdated manual processes. - Only 26% reported employing fully cloud-based strategies, indicating a need for more streamlined processes. Financial Analyst The revelation that over half of the companies surveyed have incurred payroll penalties due to non-compliance is a significant indicator of operational inefficiency and potential financial risk. From a financial standpoint, these penalties can directly affect a company's bottom line, potentially leading to an increase in operational costs and a decrease in net income. Additionally, the use of spreadsheets and manual processes by a considerable percentage of companies suggests a lag in the adoption of more efficient and cost-effective payroll systems, which could impede the ability to scale operations effectively.Investors should monitor the extent to which companies in their portfolios are addressing these inefficiencies, as it could be indicative of management's ability to implement necessary technological advancements and control costs. The shift towards streamlined processes and cloud-based strategies, while currently at a modest 26%, is a positive trend that could result in cost savings and improved compliance over the long term. However, the slow adoption rate of AI within payroll processes might signal a reluctance to invest in emerging technologies, which could be a competitive disadvantage. Market Research Analyst The report's findings highlight a broader industry trend towards digital transformation in payroll operations. The market for cloud-based human capital management solutions is growing as businesses seek to modernize their operations. Companies that successfully migrate to cloud-based payroll systems may gain a competitive edge through increased efficiency, reduced risk of non-compliance and improved data management capabilities.It is crucial for stakeholders to understand the market dynamics at play. As companies continue to prioritize the integration of payroll and benefits into unified platforms, there may be increased demand for providers offering comprehensive solutions. This could impact the competitive landscape, with potential benefits for innovators and market leaders in cloud-based human capital technology. The emphasis on employee data analysis and automatic reporting mechanisms reflects a growing need for data-driven decision-making capabilities in human resources management. Legal Expert Payroll compliance is a complex legal area, varying significantly across different jurisdictions. The report underscores the legal implications of outdated payroll practices, with more than half of the surveyed companies facing penalties. This not only suggests a widespread issue with keeping up with regulatory requirements but also indicates potential legal exposure. Companies operating across multiple countries must navigate a myriad of tax laws and employment regulations, which can be particularly challenging with outdated or manual systems.For businesses, the legal risks associated with non-compliance can extend beyond financial penalties to include reputational damage and regulatory scrutiny. The focus on integrating payroll and benefits platforms is likely a response to these challenges, aiming to ensure greater compliance and reduce the risk of legal issues. However, the slow adoption of new technologies like AI in payroll processes could be a missed opportunity to leverage advanced tools for compliance monitoring and risk management. 02/19/2024 - 08:30 AM Outdated payroll practices are penalizing organizations and emphasize the urgent need to make transformative changes in payroll management LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Alight, Inc. (NYSE: ALIT), a leading cloud-based human capital technology and services provider, today released the findings of its 2024 Company Payroll Complexity Report, which revealed that over half (53%) of surveyed companies have incurred payroll penalties in the last five years for non-compliance. Building on the data from the 2023 Alight Global Payroll Complexity Index, this new report surveyed nearly 300 payroll professionals and stakeholders to understand key aspects of payroll operations, including the number of countries that each company processes payroll in, as well as the types of processes and technology they used to execute payroll. In addition to penalties, the report found 51% of those surveyed still use spreadsheets, and 19% use outdated manual or paper processes within their payroll departments. The survey also reveals that many companies are shifting towards more streamlined processes and migrating more of their payroll operations to the cloud. Currently, only 26% reported employing fully cloud-based strategies. Despite significant media attention around AI and a continued industry trend to migrate to digital solutions, only 8% of respondents expressed intentions to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) to their payroll processes within the next two years. Organizations surveyed also placed integrating payroll and benefits into a unified platform as their number one priority, followed by employee data analysis and implementing automatic reporting mechanisms. As well, payroll challenges are magnified for companies operating in the top 10 most complex payroll processing countries where there is an increased likelihood of receiving a penalty for payroll non-compliance. The report underscores a direct correlation between the number of countries an organization operates in and the likelihood of receiving fines. Notably, 24% of organizations operating in a single country received fines. However, this percentage sharply rises to 67% for organizations expanding their operations into two-to-five countries, marking the highest prevalence of fines within this range. “Payroll is an integral part of any business and can damage an organization’s reputation if something goes wrong,” said Luca Saracino, executive vice president of payroll and professional services at Alight. “These mistakes can be mitigated with a well-integrated, single platform that combines all-important HR functions such as payroll and benefits into a one-stop shop. Streamlining such processes not only saves time and minimizes risks of human errors, but also goes a long way in safeguarding both the company and promoting employee wellbeing.” To learn more about Alight’s Company Payroll Complexity Report, download the 2024 report here. Research methodology The 2024 Company Payroll Complexity Report is the result of a survey completed by nearly 300 payroll professionals between July and September 2023. The survey targeted payroll professionals as well as key stakeholders with a vested interest in payroll operations in their respective companies including the number of countries companies processed payroll in, to the number of fines and penalties received for non-compliance. This report builds on and uses the data from the 2023 Global Payroll Complexity Index to create a holistic picture of the current payroll technology landscape, including what options companies have in terms of technology, functionality and processes to optimize their payroll operations.

About 193,100 openings for registered nurses are projected each year, on average, over the decade. The K12 Nursing Club is designed to help students ages 13+ explore the world of nursing and find a career path that suits them best. Participants will have in-depth discussions with nurses from around the U.S. who can advise them on their career journey. This club is open to all students – whether they attend a K12 school or not - and there is no cost to participate. The K12 Nursing Club is facilitated by Dr. Sherri Wilson, FAAN, Director of Partnership Development.

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., Feb. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Steelcase (NYSE: SCS), a global design and thought leader in the world of work, is the only organization in its industry to earn a top score of A- from CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project, a global nonprofit that runs the world's leading environmental disclosure platform, for its continual commitment to best practices in environmental strategy and action. In 2023, 23,000+ companies disclosed through CDP. The A- places Steelcase within the top level ""leadership"" band of scoring, with only 5% of companies achieving this rank. Steelcase has disclosed through CDP since 2011, and despite increasingly stringent criteria, has continually improved its score, most recently advancing from a B in 2022. Achieving the A- score, which not only recognizes transparency, but also the adoption of processes designed to improve the wellbeing of the planet, requires broad collaboration across all of Steelcase, including the leadership of President and CEO, Sara Armbruster, and the Board of Directors.

Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Analyst The acceptance of the New Drug Application (NDA) for DEXTENZA by the Singapore Health Sciences Authority is a significant regulatory milestone for AffaMed Therapeutics. This development can potentially expedite the drug's entry into the ASEAN market, which may result in increased revenue streams for the company. Given that DEXTENZA offers a more convenient treatment option with its sustained-release mechanism, it is poised to capture market share from traditional eye-drop treatments that require more frequent administration.From an industry perspective, the adoption of novel drug delivery systems like DEXTENZA's intracanalicular insert is indicative of a broader trend towards patient-centric solutions that enhance compliance and outcomes. AffaMed's strategic partnership with Ocular Therapeutix, Inc. for DEXTENZA's development and commercialization in key Asian markets also suggests potential for expanded market penetration and diversified risk. Market Research Analyst The ophthalmology sector in Asia is rapidly growing due to increasing prevalence of eye-related diseases and a growing middle class able to afford advanced treatments. AffaMed's NDA acceptance in Singapore positions the company advantageously in this expanding market. The company's ability to navigate the regulatory landscape in multiple Asian jurisdictions will be crucial in determining the speed and success of DEXTENZA's market adoption.Moreover, the initiation of a registrational trial in Mainland China is a strategic move, considering China's large patient population and increasing healthcare expenditure. The outcome of this trial and subsequent topline data release in Q3 2024 will be critical in influencing investor sentiment and could impact AffaMed's stock valuation, depending on the trial's success or failure. Healthcare Economist The economic implications of introducing a drug like DEXTENZA to the ASEAN and Greater China markets are multifaceted. On one hand, the reduction in the frequency of administration compared to traditional eye drops could lead to lower overall healthcare costs due to improved patient adherence and potentially fewer complications. On the other hand, the pricing strategy for DEXTENZA will be an important factor in determining its affordability and adoption rate, especially in price-sensitive markets.It is also noteworthy that the collaboration with Ocular Therapeutix may lead to shared development costs and resources, which could improve the financial efficiency of bringing DEXTENZA to market. The economic impact of this drug will ultimately depend on its market uptake, competitive pricing and the ability to displace existing treatments. 02/19/2024 - 09:00 AM SHANGHAI, Feb. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AffaMed Therapeutics (""AffaMed""), a biotechnology company dedicated to developing and commercializing transformative pharmaceutical, and surgical products that address critical unmet medical needs in ophthalmology, today announced that the Singapore Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has accepted its New Drug Application (NDA) for DEXTENZA® (0.4 mg dexamethasone ophthalmic insert) for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following ophthalmic surgery, and ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.

DEXTENZA delivers a preservative-free dose of dexamethasone for up to 30 days with a single administration, thereby offering patients significant benefit and convenience versus current treatments which require multiple administrations of eye-drops per day. ""As the first NDA filing by AffaMed, the acceptance of our DEXTENZA NDA in Singapore represents an important milestone in our company's journey to successfully advance much-needed therapeutic candidates through regulatory pathways across multiple regions in Asia,"" said Vijay Karwal, Chief Executive Officer of AffaMed.

In October 2020, AffaMed Therapeutics entered into a licensing agreement with Ocular Therapeutix, Inc. (NASDAQ: OCUL) for the development and commercialization of DEXTENZA in Greater China, South Korea, and certain ASEAN markets.

They achieved full year adjusted EBITDA of $419 million and a record high $408 million operating cash flow. Masonite enhanced its product portfolio through acquisitions of Endura Products and Fleetwood during 2023. Subsequently, they announced a definitive agreement with Owens Corning (NYSE: OC) for acquisition at $133.00 per share in cash. Positive Masonite reported a 2% decrease in net sales for the full year 2023 compared to 2022. The company's net income attributable to Masonite declined by 45% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2023 decreased by 6% compared to the previous year. Masonite's diluted earnings per share dropped by 44% in 2023 compared to 2022. The company made significant acquisitions of Endura Products and Fleetwood during 2023 to enhance its product solutions. Masonite announced an agreement with Owens Corning for acquisition at $133.00 per share in cash. The company's gross profit margin increased by 170 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2023. Masonite's SG&A expenses increased by 27% in the fourth quarter of 2023 due to various factors. Net loss attributable to Masonite in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $10 million, primarily driven by charges related to goodwill impairment in the Europe reporting unit. Masonite's cash flow from operations significantly increased to $408 million in 2023 from $189 million in the previous year. Negative Masonite reported a decrease in net income and adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2023 compared to 2022. The company's diluted earnings per share and net sales experienced declines in 2023. Masonite incurred charges related to goodwill impairment in the Europe reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2023, leading to a net loss. The cancellation of the live conference call to discuss fourth quarter results due to the pending acquisition by Owens Corning might limit shareholder communication. The increase in SG&A expenses by 27% in the fourth quarter of 2023 could impact the company's profitability. Financial Analyst The acquisition of Masonite by Owens Corning for $133.00 per share represents a significant premium over the average repurchase price of $89.96 per share, indicating a favorable exit for current shareholders. The reported net sales decline of 2% and a 45% decrease in net income attribute to Masonite year-over-year reflect market challenges, yet the record high operating cash flow of $408 million showcases strong cash-generating capabilities. The SG&A increase of 19% suggests rising operational costs that could impact future profitability margins if not managed post-acquisition.Adjusted EBITDA margin contraction by 60 basis points indicates margin pressures, yet the company's ability to maintain a gross profit margin increase of 20 basis points year-over-year despite lower volumes and inflationary pressures demonstrates effective cost management strategies. The balance sheet shows robust liquidity, which, combined with the cash flow performance, positions Masonite favorably for the acquisition by Owens Corning, potentially allowing for smooth integration and investment in strategic initiatives. Market Research Analyst The reported decrease in organic volume and average unit price (AUP) in both North American Residential and Europe segments could reflect a cooling demand in the construction and home improvement markets. The 19% decrease in Architectural net sales volume could be a result of project delays or budget cuts in commercial construction. However, the strategic acquisitions of Endura Products and Fleetwood have partially offset these declines, indicating Masonite's agility in diversifying its product offerings and revenue streams.The goodwill impairment charge in the Europe segment is a notable event, suggesting a reassessment of the value of the acquired business and its future profitability prospects. This could signal underlying challenges in the European market that Owens Corning will need to address post-acquisition. Investors and stakeholders should monitor how the integration of Masonite into Owens Corning's portfolio will leverage Masonite's existing product solutions and drive innovation in the building materials sector. Legal Expert The pending acquisition of Masonite by Owens Corning is subject to shareholder approval, regulatory clearances and other customary closing conditions, which introduces a degree of uncertainty until the transaction is finalized. The unanimous approval by both companies' Boards of Directors is a positive sign, but investors should be aware of potential regulatory hurdles that could delay or impact the terms of the deal.Additionally, the cancellation of the live conference call in light of the pending transaction limits the immediate availability of further management insights into the quarterly results and future strategies. This could result in a temporary information vacuum for investors until the filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC. Stakeholders should closely review this report for any additional details on the company's financial health and the implications of the acquisition. 02/19/2024 - 04:44 PM Reported full year 2023 net sales of $2.8 billion and net income attributable to Masonite of $118 million Delivered full year adjusted EBITDA* of $419 million and a record high $408 million of operating cash flow Enhanced portfolio of product solutions with acquisitions of Endura Products and Fleetwood during 2023 Subsequent to year end, announced definitive agreement under which Owens Corning (NYSE: OC) will acquire all outstanding shares of Masonite for $133.00 per share in cash TAMPA, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Masonite International Corporation (""Masonite"" or ""the Company"") (NYSE: DOOR) today announced results for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2023.

Fourth Quarter 2023 Discussion (All references to percent increase or decrease in the discussion below compare current fourth quarter 2023 results to those realized in the fourth quarter of 2022 unless otherwise noted.) Consolidated net sales were $661 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, a 2% decrease resulting from an 11% decrease in organic volume and a 2% decrease in average unit price (AUP), partially offset by a 10% increase from acquisitions and a 1% increase from favorable foreign exchange. North American Residential net sales were $538 million, a 2% increase, driven by a 13% increase from acquisitions, partially offset by a 9% decrease in organic volume and 2% lower AUP. Europe net sales were $53 million, a 13% decrease, driven by a 14% decrease in volume and a 4% decrease in AUP, partially offset by a 5% increase due to favorable foreign exchange. Architectural net sales were $67 million, a 19% decrease, driven by a 24% decrease in volume and component sales, partially offset by a 5% increase in AUP. Total Company gross profit was $151 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 6%. Gross profit margin increased 170 basis points year over year to 22.9%, due to effective price-cost management, which was enough to offset the impact of lower volumes and inflation on wages, benefits and overhead. Selling, general and administration (SG&A) expenses were $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 27%. The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by the addition of SG&A from acquisitions as well as year-over-year differences in the timing of adjustments to variable compensation expense. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 17.0%. Net loss attributable to Masonite was $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to net income of $31 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by $33 million in charges related to goodwill impairment in the Europe reporting unit. Adjusted EBITDA* of $87 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased 5% from $91 million. Diluted loss per share was $0.46 in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to earnings of $1.38 in the comparable 2022 period. Adjusted EPS* was $1.29 in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $1.72 in the comparable 2022 period. Full Year 2023 Discussion (All references to percent increase or decrease in the discussion below compare current full year 2023 results to those realized in full year 2022 unless otherwise noted.) Consolidated net sales were $2,831 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, a 2% decrease resulting from a 14% decrease in organic volume and a 1% decrease in component sales, partially offset by a 9% increase from acquisitions and a 4% increase in AUP. North American Residential net sales were $2,245 million, a 2% decrease, driven by a 15% decrease in organic volume and a 1% decrease due to unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by an 11% increase from acquisitions and a 3% increase in AUP. Europe net sales were $247 million, a 12% decrease, driven by an 11% decrease in volume and a 1% decrease in component sales. AUP was flat year over year. Architectural net sales were $323 million, a 5% increase, driven by an 18% increase in AUP, partially offset by a 9% decrease in volume, a 3% decrease in the sale of components and a 1% decrease due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Total company gross profit was $666 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of 1%. Gross profit margin increased 20 basis points to 23.5%, as higher AUP and cost savings initiatives were enough to offset the impact of lower volumes and inflation on wages, benefits and overhead. SG&A expenses were $412 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 19% due largely to the year-over-year addition of SG&A from acquisitions, as well as wage and benefits inflation, higher professional fees, information technology costs and additional investments in strategic initiatives. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 14.5%. Net income attributable to Masonite was $118 million in 2023 compared to $214 million in 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by higher SG&A expenses and $33 million in charges related to goodwill impairment in the Europe reporting unit. Adjusted EBITDA* of $419 million in 2023 decreased 6% from $446 million in 2022. Diluted earnings per share were $5.29 in the 2023 fiscal year compared to $9.41 in the comparable 2022 period. Adjusted EPS* was $7.53 in the 2023 fiscal year compared to $9.73 in the comparable 2022 period. Balance Sheet, Cash Flow and Capital Allocation At the end of the fourth quarter, total available liquidity was $437 million, inclusive of $300 million of availability under our ABL Facility and AR Sales Program and $137 million in unrestricted cash. Cash flow from operations was $408 million in 2023, up from $189 million in the comparable period of 2022. Capital expenditures were $113 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, down from $114 million in the comparable period of 2022. During the fourth quarter, Masonite repurchased approximately 84 thousand shares of stock for $7 million, at an average price of $88.88. In fiscal 2023, the Company repurchased approximately 518 thousand shares of stock for $47 million, at an average price of $89.96 per share. Acquisition by Owens Corning On February 8, 2024, Masonite and Owens Corning entered into a definitive agreement under which Owens Corning will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Masonite for $133.00 per share in cash. The transaction has been unanimously approved by both companies' Board of Directors and is subject to Masonite shareholders' approval, as well as various regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The transaction is anticipated to close by the middle of 2024. In light of this pending transaction, Masonite has cancelled plans to hold a live conference call to discuss fourth quarter results. Additional information on the Company's results can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K to be filed with the SEC by February 29, 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Related Information Our management reviews net sales and adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Net assets are not allocated to the reportable segments. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which does not have a standardized meaning under GAAP and is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to either net income or operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not include certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Masonite adjusted to exclude the following items: depreciation; amortization; share based compensation expense; loss (gain) on disposal of property, plant and equipment; registration and listing fees; restructuring costs; asset impairment; loss (gain) on disposal of subsidiaries; interest expense (income), net; loss on extinguishment of debt; other (income) expense, net; income tax expense (benefit); other items; loss (income) from discontinued operations, net of tax; and net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest. This definition of adjusted EBITDA differs from the definitions of EBITDA contained in the indentures governing the 2028 and 2030 Notes and the credit agreements governing the ABL Facility and Term Loan Facility. Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated under our ABL Facility or senior notes would also include, among other things, additional add-backs for amounts related to: cost savings projected by us in good faith to be realized as a result of actions taken or expected to be taken prior to or during the relevant period; fees and expenses in connection with certain plant closures and layoffs; and the amount of any restructuring charges, integration costs or other business optimization expenses or reserve deducted in the relevant period in computing consolidated net income, including any one-time costs incurred in connection with acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA is used to evaluate and compare the performance of the segments and it is one of the primary measures used to determine employee incentive compensation. Intersegment sales are recorded using market prices. We believe that adjusted EBITDA, from an operations standpoint, provides an appropriate way to measure and assess segment performance. Our management team has established the practice of reviewing the performance of each segment based on the measures of net sales and adjusted EBITDA. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is useful to users of the consolidated financial statements because it provides the same information that we use internally to evaluate and compare the performance of the segments and it is one of the primary measures used to determine employee incentive compensation. The tables below set forth a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Masonite to adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as adjusted EBITDA divided by Net Sales. Management believes this measure provides supplemental information on how successfully we operate our business. Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings (loss) per common share attributable to Masonite (EPS) less restructuring costs, asset impairment charges, loss (gain) on disposal of subsidiaries, loss on extinguishment of debt and other items, if any, that do not relate to Masonite’s underlying business performance (each net of related tax expense (benefit)). Management uses this measure to evaluate the overall performance of the Company and believes this measure provides investors with helpful supplemental information regarding the underlying performance of the Company from period to period. This measure may be inconsistent with similar measures presented by other companies. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP liquidity measure used by investors, financial analysts and management to help evaluate the Company's ability to generate cash to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value. Free cash flow is not a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures due to our mandatory debt service requirements. As a conversion ratio, free cash flow is compared to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Masonite. Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are used internally by the Company for various purposes, including reporting results of operations to the Board of Directors of the Company and analysis of performance. Management believes that these measures provide a useful representation of our operational performance and liquidity; however, the measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net cash flow provided by operating activities or net income attributable to Masonite as prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain amounts in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and associated tables may not foot due to rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts.

Key presentations include comparisons of risankizumab and ustekinumab in Crohn's disease, risankizumab maintenance therapy in ulcerative colitis, and long-term safety data on upadacitinib in Crohn's disease. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst Examining the data from AbbVie's presentations at the ECCO congress provides critical insights into the development and effectiveness of treatments for inflammatory bowel diseases. The focus on risankizumab and upadacitinib, particularly in the context of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, highlights the potential for these drugs to alter the current treatment landscape. The use of endoscopic outcomes as key trial endpoints is significant, as mucosal healing is increasingly recognized as an important goal in IBD management, correlating with better long-term patient outcomes.Post-hoc analyses, such as those presented from the SEQUENCE trial, are instrumental in understanding the nuances of drug efficacy and can guide more personalized treatment strategies. The COMMAND and U-ENDURE trial results further illuminate the safety and maintenance potential of these therapies, which is crucial for chronic conditions like IBD. The economic impact of achieving mucosal healing is another vital aspect, as it can influence healthcare costs and patient quality of life. Health Economist The post-hoc analysis of the economic impact of achieving mucosal healing on ulcerative colitis-related hospitalizations and work productivity presents a compelling angle for stakeholders. By quantifying the potential reduction in healthcare resource utilization and improvement in work productivity, this data can justify the investment in newer therapies from a cost-effectiveness standpoint. It's essential to consider the broader economic implications of these treatments beyond direct medical costs, including the potential for reducing long-term disability and associated societal costs. Pharmaceutical Market Research Analyst The competitive landscape of IBD treatments is evolving with the introduction of new biologics and JAK inhibitors like risankizumab and upadacitinib. The detailed long-term efficacy and safety data presented can be a differentiating factor for AbbVie's portfolio in a crowded market. By showcasing the effectiveness of these drugs in patients with different baseline characteristics and prior treatment failures, AbbVie is positioning its products to meet the needs of a diverse patient population. Understanding these dynamics is essential for forecasting market trends and anticipating the impact on AbbVie's market share and revenue growth. 02/19/2024 - 08:30 AM – A total of 17 accepted abstracts, including nine oral presentations and eight posters, reinforce AbbVie's commitment to produce a portfolio of products that aim to improve the lives of patients living with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)– Oral data presentations include a new post-hoc analysis of clinical and endoscopic outcomes from the SEQUENCE trial comparing risankizumab (SKYRIZI®) versus ustekinumab, results from the COMMAND Phase 3 study of risankizumab as a maintenance therapy in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC), and long-term safety results from the U-ENDURE trial of upadacitinib (RINVOQ®) in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD)– Research accepted for presentation reiterates AbbVie's commitment to understanding the needs of the gastroenterology community and advance standards of care in IBD NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., Feb. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) announced that 17 AbbVie-sponsored abstracts, including new data from its inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) portfolio, have been accepted for presentation at the 19th Congress of European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) taking place in Stockholm, Sweden from February 21-24.

Risankizumab is not approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. SKYRIZI® (risankizumab) is part of a collaboration between Boehringer Ingelheim and AbbVie, with AbbVie leading development and commercialization globally. About Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of diseases characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the most common forms of IBD. In both CD and UC, the immune system causes inflammation and damage to the mucosa – or lining – of the gut.1-3 Specifically, CD manifests as inflammation within the GI tract, most commonly in the area between the small intestine (ileum) and the colon, causing persistent diarrhea and abdominal pain.1,4 UC is a chronic, idiopathic, immune-mediated IBD of the large intestine that causes continuous mucosal inflammation extending, to a variable extent, from the rectum to the more proximal colon.3,5 The hallmark signs and symptoms of UC include rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, tenesmus (a sense of pressure), urgency and fecal incontinence.3,5 CD and UC are progressive diseases, meaning they get worse over time and may lead to life-threatening complications or surgery.6,7 Because the signs and symptoms of CD and UC are unpredictable, they cause a significant burden on people living with the disease—not only physically, but also emotionally and economically.7,8 About Risankizumab (SKYRIZI®)SKYRIZI is an interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor that selectively blocks IL-23 by binding to its p19 subunit. IL-23, a cytokine involved in inflammatory processes, is thought to be linked to a number of chronic immune-mediated diseases.9-12 SKYRIZI is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease.9,10 About RINVOQ® (upadacitinib)Discovered and developed by AbbVie scientists, RINVOQ is a selective JAK inhibitor that is being studied in several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Based on enzymatic and cellular assays, RINVOQ demonstrated greater inhibitory potency for JAK-1 and JAK-2 relative to JAK-3, and TYK-2. The relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness and safety is not currently known.13-14 Phase 3 trials of RINVOQ in rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, giant cell arteritis, Takayasu arteritis, and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis are ongoing.12 U.S. Indications and Important Safety Information about SKYRIZI® (risankizumab-rzaa)9SKYRIZI is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with: moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who may benefit from taking injections or pills (systemic therapy) or treatment using ultraviolet or UV light (phototherapy).active psoriatic arthritis (PsA).moderate to severe Crohn's disease.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWhat is the most important information I should know about SKYRIZI® (risankizumab-rzaa)?
