But last week’s surprise cut in Switzerland and dovish outlooks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his counterparts at the Bank of England and the European Central Bank leave investors with reason to once again position for easing.Among money managers such as Pimco and BlackRock Inc., and one-time bond king Bill Gross, the prospect of lower rates is boosting the allure of shorter-dated obligations due in around five years or less, which stand to gain the most as rate-cut speculation builds.That sort of outperformance relative to longer maturities is a recipe for so-called steepener bets, where the yield curve returns to a traditional upward slope. Of course, there’s still the risk that central banks again fail to vindicate the bullishness around shorter tenors given inflation remains sticky and labor markets continue to hold up.“Whether we actually get what is priced in is a moot point, but for the current direction of travel, the promise is all that matters for now,” said Jim Reid, Deutsche Bank AG’s global head of economics and thematic research. While markets are focused on a “dovish narrative, it’s worth bearing in mind that sentiment on rates has switched back and forth over 2024,” he said.Indeed, Reid and his colleagues reckon markets have pivoted towards dovish policy seven times in this cycle and on the last six occasions the outcomes were actually hawkish.Story continues2023 FlickerFor now, investors are feeling a flicker of what unfolded in late-2023. At the time, the Treasury market seemed set for a third straight annual loss, but it rallied into year-end as expectations swept global markets that policymakers would reduce rates early in 2024.While they seem to be in sync now, central banks could still end up moving at different speeds, which may present money-making openings.“It’s likely the big central banks such as the ECB, Fed and BOE all get started cutting rates in the middle of this year, and that’s where the similarities stop,” Michael Cudzil, portfolio manager at Pacific Investment Management Co., told Bloomberg Television. “The speed and destination will vary across the globe and that’s great for fixed-income opportunities.”Rates traders are leaning toward June as the start of the Fed easing cycle, after entering the year banking on a March kickoff. For all of 2024, they see a bit more than Fed officials’ median forecast of 75 basis points of reductions. June is also when markets expect the ECB and the BOE to start cutting, with at least several moves priced in from both.Among the major central banks, the Bank of Japan stands apart, with economists projecting it will lift rates again later this year, after scrapping its easing program last week.What Bloomberg Strategists Say...“If central banks have it their way, we could have first rate cuts from the Fed, ECB, BOC and the BOE all done and dusted by the end of the first half. That means that front-end yields in the major economies will continue to trend lower as there is no point in fighting the central banks.”— Ven Ram, strategistClick here to read the full reportElection TwistFor Kellie Wood at Schroders Plc in Sydney, the dovish pivot from most of the key central banks “sets up the bond market to be probably one of the best-performing markets this year.”Still, she sees room for divergence, especially with the US presidential election looming in November.“There’s a small window for the Fed to be cutting maybe 50 basis points before the election, but we think that’s as good as it gets,” said the firm’s deputy head of fixed income. Her portfolio is neutral on the US front end, while bullishly positioned in short-dated bonds in Europe and UK gilts.The US Treasury curve briefly steepened after the Fed met, but two-year yields remain roughly 40 basis points above 10-year rates. The curve has been upside-down like that, or inverted in traders’ parlance, since around mid-2022.Complicating investors’ calculus around the extent of the steepening ahead, Fed officials revised their inflation and growth outlooks higher last week, and trimmed the number of cuts they anticipate over the next two years.The revisions for 2025 and 2026 “show that we’re going to have a shallow easing cycle,” said David Rogal, a portfolio manager in the fundamental fixed-income group at BlackRock.That suggests “some curve steepening,” he said, and for that reason the group is “underweight intermediate and long-end rates - seven to 30 years — in our portfolios.”What to WatchEconomic data:March 25: Chicago Fed national activity index; Bloomberg US economic survey; new homes sales; Dallas Fed manufacturing activityMarch 26: Philadelphia Fed non-manufacturing activity; durable goods; capital goods; FHFA house price index; S&P CoreLogic; Conference Board consumer confidence; Richmond Fed manufacturing index and business conditions; Dallas Fed services activityMarch 27: MBA mortgage applications; wholesale inventories (revisions)March 28: GDP (Q4); personal consumption; GDP price index; initial jobless claims; pending home sales; MNI Chicago PMI; U. of Michigan sentiment and inflation expectations; Kansas City Fed manufacturing activityMarch 29: Personal income and spending; PCE deflator; advance goods trade balance; retail and wholesale inventories; Kansas City Fed services activityMarch 29: Good Friday.

Motley Fool,These 2 Magnificent Stocks Have Skyrocketed in the Past. Is It Time to Buy Them Now With $100 and Hold Through 2024 (and Beyond)?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-magnificent-stocks-skyrocketed-past-182700484.html,These two thriving businesses prove that boring is beautiful in the stock market.,"When you think about magnificent stocks, I'm sure the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech-focused and innovative enterprises come to mind. Their returns in the past decade have certainly been spectacular.But there are two lesser-known and definitely more boring companies that have also trounced the market. I'm talking about O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ: ORLY) and AutoZone (NYSE: AZO). The former is up 678% in the past 10 years, while the latter has risen 498% during that time.Should you buy these two skyrocketing retail stocks with $100 and hold through 2024 and beyond?Steady wins the raceThese businesses won't win any awards when it comes to excitement and disruptive potential. They are quite the opposite. However, being boring has clearly worked out well for investors.Through their networks of thousands of stores, both O'Reilly and AutoZone sell aftermarket car parts and supplies to both DIY and commercial customers. That detail about aftermarket parts is critical, as these companies thrive when selling to consumers that own cars running past the original manufacturer's warranty. With the average age of vehicles on the road slowly rising with each passing year, coupled with more miles driven, there is plenty of demand out there.Basically, these businesses perform well when there's more wear and tear on cars. It's of the utmost importance for people to have working vehicles to manage their day-to-day life, whether it's to run errands, drop off and pick up kids from school, or get to work. This makes both O'Reilly and AutoZone somewhat recession-proof.That's a fantastic quality to have in stocks that you own because you don't need to be able to predict what the economy is going to do next. The companies in question will do well no matter what.Capital returnsGiven that they experience stable demand trends regardless of the economic environment, these companies are able to generate copious amounts of profits and cash. O'Reilly and AutoZone raked in $2 billion and $2.1 billion of free cash flow, respectively, in their last fiscal years. This is the true mark of a financially sound enterprise.Story continuesNeither business pays dividends. But both management teams are very aggressive when it comes to share buybacks. Just in the past five years, a time period that included various disruptions like the pandemic, supply chain bottlenecks, inflationary pressures, and higher interest rates, O'Reilly's share count was reduced by 26%, while AutoZone's shrunk by 30%.For existing investors, this is a financial boon because it boosts earnings per share. Shareholders' ownership stakes increase over time if they do nothing. That's a powerful development.What's encouraging is that this attractive capital-return policy comes after executives reinvest in growth initiatives. After opening new stores or distribution facilities each year, share buybacks are done. That should lead to even greater revenue and earnings over time.Is the price right?With the overall market in record territory, it's probably not surprising that both O'Reilly and AutoZone are also near all-time highs. Just like their underlying businesses, these stocks continue to deliver for investors.This means that they aren't necessarily trading at bargain prices. On a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis, both stocks are selling at some of their highest levels in the past decade. Consequently, it looks like these boring businesses have caught the eye of the market, with investors being incredibly optimistic about their prospects.It's important to ask yourself how much emphasis you place on valuation. Of course, it would be a much better situation if O'Reilly and AutoZone were trading at cheaper P/E multiples. But what gains would you be giving up if you waited on the sidelines? I believe the best move might simply be to spend $50 on each of these stocks and hold for the long term.Should you invest $1,000 in AutoZone right now?Before you buy stock in AutoZone, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and AutoZone wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,3 Stocks That Have Tripled the Market's Return So Far This Year,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-tripled-markets-return-181500853.html,"In a rising market, these growth stocks stand out from the pack.","The rally that sent stocks soaring 24% in 2023 isn't over just yet. Year to date, the benchmark S&P 500 has gained another 9.9% as Mar. 21. Wall Street has been enthusiastic about the prospect that interest rates could start declining soon, while the U.S. economy remains in growth mode.Many stocks have benefited disproportionately from that bullish attitude among investors, but a few stand out for already tripling the market's year-to-date return. Let's look at three of the biggest winners so far this year: Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Deckers (NYSE: DECK), and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX).1. DeckersDeckers has been riding a wave of strong demand for many of its popular footwear brands like Hoka and Ugg. These wins help it stand out compared to peers such as Nike, which has been struggling with weak sales and pricing trends recently.Deckers is seeing no such challenges. In fact, sales were up 16% in its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Dec. 31). Compare that to Nike's modest sales decline in its last reported quarter, and you can understand why investors have pushed Deckers stock higher this year. The company is also selling many of its products at full price, highlighting another way this business has separated itself from competitors. Gross profit margin jumped to 53% of sales last quarter compared to 48% of sales in the prior-year period.Management hiked its fiscal 2024 outlook for a second time last month. Inventory levels are low as well, suggesting lots of room for earnings growth and higher stock returns ahead.2. Meta PlatformsA year ago, investors were worried about Meta Platforms' slowing growth and its ballooning expenses, yet those concerns have completely fallen away over the last few quarters. The social media giant is not only boosting its user base but improving the economics around its ads.Large advertisers are sticking with the Facebook and Instagram platforms even as they pull back on spending elsewhere. Ad impressions rose 21% in the fourth quarter, contributing to a 25% increase in revenue. Combine that success with dramatic cost-cutting moves (its employee headcount was down 22% last quarter), and you've got the ingredients you need for soaring earnings.Story continuesNet income jumped 69% in 2023 to $39.1 billion. As if that wasn't enough to keep Wall Street happy, Meta also initiated a dividend with the first payout hitting shareholders' accounts in late March.3. NetflixDon't look now, but Netflix stock is finally climbing back toward the all-time high it set in late 2021. The streaming video giant has taken investors on a roller-coaster ride the past few years. Shares collapsed from approximately $690 to $170 as the pandemic growth hangover set in, and the company endured its first-ever back-to-back quarters of subscriber losses (in Q1 and Q2 2022).It turns out that decline was just a temporary speed bump -- year-over-year subscriber gains have accelerated for four consecutive quarters with 12.8% growth in Q4. Netflix now counts 260.3 million paying subscribers, up from 230.8 million at the start of 2023.Wall Street is excited about the prospects for even faster growth ahead as Netflix's advertising business matures and its account-sharing crackdown continues to reap benefits. As long as Netflix can keep boosting its subscriber base, cash flow, and operating margins, investors can expect to keep watching this stock deliver excellent returns.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Motley Fool,"Forget AGNC Investment, Buy This Magnificent Dividend Stock Instead",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-agnc-investment-buy-magnificent-180100683.html,Don't fall for AGNC Investment's huge yield. This dividend stock is more reliable and still generates a very attractive income stream.,"It is hard to pass up a big yield, but sometimes an ultra-high dividend yield is a sign of risk. That's the case with AGNC Investment (NASDAQ: AGNC), which is offering a massive 15% yield. You would be much better off lowering your yield expectations and buying out-of-favor Realty Income (NYSE: O). Its 5.9% yield isn't nearly as enticing, but you can actually count on it. Here's why you should forget about AGNC and buy Realty Income instead.One graph is all you needThere's that old saying that a picture is worth a thousand words. Well, in the case of AGNC Investment, that picture is actually a graph, which you'll see below. To summarize the image in as few words as possible, the dividend is highly variable and has headed steadily lower for at least a decade. The stock price has followed along for the ride, trending lower and lower as well.AGNC ChartWhat's interesting is that the dividend yield (the blue line) has remained fairly high all along. That's just the basic math of dividend yields, but it means that AGNC is regularly popping up on dividend yield screens even though an investment here would have left dividend investors with less income and less capital over the past decade. That's about as bad as it can get for an investor trying to live off of the income their portfolio generates.Most investors should pass this stock by and instead consider a reliable dividend stock like Realty Income.Realty Income is a dividend machineRealty Income and AGNC are both real estate investment trusts (REITs). But AGNC is a unique type of REIT that buys mortgage securities, a complex and high-risk niche in the REIT space. Realty Income is much more boring; it buys physical properties that it leases out to tenants. Virtually all of its portfolio is net lease, which means that a single tenant is leasing a property and that the tenant is responsible for most property-level operating costs. Although any single property is high risk, across a large portfolio, the risk is very low. Realty Income is the largest net lease REIT, with a portfolio of more than 15,000 properties.Story continuesO Dividend Per Share (Quarterly) ChartThe yield, at around 5.9%, is near its highest levels of the past decade, which suggests that now is an attractive time to buy Realty Income stock. The first question you should ask is, ""Why is the yield historically high?"" The answer is that interest rates have gone up, increasing the cost of capital for Realty Income (and other REITs). That is a headwind for sure, but property markets have historically adjusted to interest rate shifts and are likely to do so again.Meanwhile, Realty Income is the largest net lease REIT by a wide margin. It is more than twice the size of its next-closest competitor, giving it a size advantage when it comes to buying new assets. In fact, it has bought up a couple of REIT peers in recent years, adding industry consolidation to its growth opportunities. Helping the bullish thesis is an investment-grade balance sheet and an increasingly diversified portfolio, including a growing presence in Europe.The proof of the company's success is found in the dividend, which has increased for 29 consecutive years. While the annualized dividend growth rate is modest, coming in at roughly 4.3% over that span, it is pretty clear that income investors can count on Realty Income to keep paying through thick and thin. If you are looking for a sustainable high yield, Realty Income is a much better choice than AGNC.Be careful what you wish forIf all you do is look at a stock's dividend yield, you risk setting yourself up for severe pain. AGNC is a good example of this. Its yield remained high even as it was regularly cutting the dividend payment. Realty Income will serve dividend investors much better, if history is any guide. And the fact that the REIT is out of favor today, and offering a historically high yield, is a long-term opportunity that you shouldn't overlook.Should you invest $1,000 in AGNC Investment Corp. right now?Before you buy stock in AGNC Investment Corp., consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and AGNC Investment Corp. wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Is BigBear.ai Stock a Buy Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bigbear-ai-stock-buy-now-171300849.html,"This data analytics newcomer has potential, but also risks. Can this young company compete with the established giants of its chosen field?","The tech world is a competitive landscape. Three companies vying for investor attention in the even more heated subsector of data analytics are Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), Palantir (NYSE: PLTR), and BigBear.ai (NYSE: BBAI). Snowflake and Palantir are established players, but BigBear.ai is a fresher name trying to carve out its niche in this gigantic market. So, should investors consider adding this up-and-coming data analytics expert to their stock portfolios?BigBear.ai by the numbersLet's examine the valuation metrics in this area.Snowflake, with its high price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 18.6, is soaring on a wave of investor optimism. Palantir's even richer P/S ratio of 24.1 suggests it might be overvalued, even in comparison to Snowflake. BigBear.ai, on the other hand, carries a more modes P/S ratio of 2.0.The equation changes dramatically if you switch from sales to profit-based metrics. Snowflake and Palantir trade at triple-digit multiples to forward earnings estimates. Their price to free cash flow ratios stand between 60 and 80. These are nosebleed-inducing numbers, more than enough to keep value investors far away.But BigBear isn't profitable in any meaningful way. The company has recently achieved positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and operating cash flows, but only on a single-quarter basis and by the slimmest of margins. That's a nice start but its trailing four-quarter results remain negative. Therefore, traditional valuation metrics don't make sense for this unprofitable enterprise.However, profit-based valuation is just one piece of the puzzle. The potential for sustained business growth is crucial for identifying future winners, especially in the growth-oriented tech sector. Snowflake boasts impressive historical and projected EPS growth, justifying its premium to some extent. Palantir, while showing decent growth, hasn't fully convinced everyone it can maintain its momentum. BigBear.ai, as a new company, still needs to prove its long-term growth trajectory.Story continuesAs it stands today, BigBear hasn't even started the ignition process. Snowflake and Palantir enjoyed robust top-line gains in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom of 2023, but BigBear's revenue growth actually slowed down instead:BBAI Revenue (TTM) ChartA quick overviewNow, let's take a closer look at BigBear.ai and its larger rivals:Snowflake: The data warehousing company is popular for its cloud-based platform and scalability. However, its high valuation, limited profits, and dependence on a few large customers are concerns for some investors.Palantir: This data analytics company is known for its work with government agencies and its focus on artificial intelligence. However, its opaque business model and heavy reliance on government contracts raise questions about its long-term prospects.BigBear.ai: This newcomer focuses on artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions for government and commercial clients. Its lower valuation and promising technology are attractive, but its short operating history and lack of profitability are significant risks. Furthermore, for better or worse, this company relies on government contracts to an even larger degree than Palantir.To buy, or not to buy, that is the questionSo, is BigBear.ai stock a better buy than Snowflake or Palantir today?The answer is complicated. While its lower valuation might seem appealing, remember that this young company still needs to prove itself -- and it's off to a relatively slow start, as seen in the revenue chart above.For investors seeking a safer bet with proven growth, Snowflake might be the better choice despite its premium price. Palantir, with its intriguing technology and government connections, could be a good high-growth idea for those willing to take on more risk.BigBear.ai, with its unproven potential for high growth, might appeal to speculative investors comfortable with a higher degree of uncertainty. Remember, growth investors won't pay too much attention until the company shifts its operating gearbox into a higher gear, and value investors aren't even looking in BigBear.ai's direction yet.Ultimately, the decision of whether to invest in BigBear.ai depends on your individual risk tolerance and investment goals. Carefully weigh the potential rewards against the risks before making your decision. Personally, I'd rather take a second look at Snowflake or Palantir before putting real money into BigBear.ai stock.Should you invest $1,000 in BigBear.ai right now?Before you buy stock in BigBear.ai, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and BigBear.ai wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Is It Too Late to Buy Meta Platforms Stock?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-buy-meta-platforms-stock-150000090.html,The social media company has pulled off an amazing turnaround.,"Many tech stocks surged over the past year thanks to factors such as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. One stock that more than doubled in that time is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META).The Facebook parent was at a 52-week low of $197.90 last March, but made an incredible reversal, and this March, it reached a high of $523.57. Shares have retreated from that, so is now the time to buy? Or is it too late to reap further upside?To assess the situation, it's best to evaluate Meta from the perspective of a long-term investment. With this in mind, let's look at the social media company to determine if it makes sense to invest in its stock at this time.How Meta shares achieved outsize resultsPart of evaluating Meta as a potential investment requires understanding how its shares performed such a remarkable about-face over the last year. The factors leading to this outcome began in 2022.At the start of that year, the company's share price exceeded $300. But as the year wore on, shares were battered because advertisers reduced spending with the company in 2022 and into 2023 in response to conditions at the time, such as rising inflation.This was a blow to Meta since digital advertising accounts for nearly all of its revenue. As a result, 2022 sales dropped to $116.6 billion from $117.9 billion in 2021.That set the stage for the comeback. The advertising market recovered in 2023, allowing Meta to achieve full-year revenue of $134.9 billion, a 16% year-over-year gain.The company also aggressively cut costs last year with CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling 2023 Meta's ""year of efficiency."" As part of this, the company reduced its employee count by 22% compared to 2022.This helped to bring 2023 costs and expenses to $88.2 billion. Although this figure was a modest increase from $87.7 billion in 2022, it was a vast improvement over the 23% jump between 2021's $71.2 billion in expenses and 2022.These cost cuts helped Meta generate strong free cash flow (FCF) of $43 billion last year, a substantial increase from $18.4 billion in 2022. FCF provides insight into the cash available to invest in the business, pay debt obligations, repurchase shares, and fund dividends.Story continuesConsequently, Meta declared its first dividend in company history on Feb. 1. This news, its cost cuts, and strong revenue rebound all contributed to the share price shooting skyward.Meta's future revenue growthYear-over-year revenue gains are likely to continue, at least in 2024. The advertising industry forecasts digital ad spending to increase this year by more than 13% over 2023, serving as a tailwind for Meta's revenue growth.The company expects first-quarter revenue of at least $34.5 billion, which would be a double-digit increase over 2023's $28.6 billion. Beyond advertising, Meta looks toward the twin tech innovations of the metaverse and AI for its business growth.Last year, Meta released the latest version of its smart glasses, now infused with AI, that allow the wearer to livestream to Facebook and Instagram. Zuckerberg described this product as ""a good example of how our AI and metaverse visions are connected.""This kind of innovation could help keep users attached to the company's services. In fact, the number of monthly active users for its products, excluding its Reality Labs division, ticked up from 3.7 billion to 4 billion in 2023.And the Reality Labs segment, which develops products for the metaverse, generated quarterly revenue of over $1 billion for the first time in the fourth quarter.To buy or not to buy Meta stockMeta's success is far from assured in these new technologies. For instance, management says its investments in the metaverse ""may only be fully realized in the next decade.""Another consideration is that Wall Street analysts estimate a median price target of $525 for its stock. This indicates a belief in some upside for Meta shares, although analysts don't expect the outsize growth experienced over the past year.This assessment by analysts combined with rising advertising income and Meta's investments in AI and the metaverse -- which can extend its reach beyond computer and mobile phone screens -- mean Meta stock is a buy.That said, the stock has an uphill climb to outperform in the way it did over the past year. The company experienced a specific confluence of factors that propelled its stock to gains eight times greater than the S&P 500 in 2023.But long-term prospects look promising, especially if efforts, such as its Meta glasses, can develop into significant revenue streams to help the company diversify beyond advertising.Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

Here's Why You Shouldn't Buy It Right Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/costco-magnificent-stock-heres-why-143000918.html,"Everyone knows about this top retail business, but its returns going forward might disappoint.","It's not just companies with exposure to the hypergrowth artificial intelligence space that have registered huge returns. Even a boring retailer, such as Costco (NASDAQ: COST), is up big. Its shares have more than tripled just in the last five years. For comparison's sake, the S&P 500 is up 86% during the same time.This has undoubtedly been a magnificent stock. It's already up double digits in 2024 (as of March 21) as the momentum continues. And it was a longtime favorite of the late great Charlie Munger.However, you shouldn't buy Costco shares right now. There's a very obvious reason for that.Don't ignore a key factor in investingThe era of ultra-low interest rates and cheap debt during the 2010s led to surging stock prices that were disconnected from business fundamentals. In this environment, it seemed like investors cared less about valuation, instead prioritizing growth and business quality above all else. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it ignores the fact that valuation is still a critical component of successful investing.Here's where Costco's monster stock return in recent years has become a reason not to buy shares. As of this writing, the stock trades at a nosebleed price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just under 49. Except for earlier this month, shares haven't been this expensive this century. This tells me that the optimism surrounding Costco is at high levels right now.And that's precisely why it's not smart to buy the stock. Yes, Costco has reported strong fundamentals. However, its P/E ratio has also soared by 60% in the past five years. The market continues to bid up the stock, even as the business's growth opportunities become limited over time. No one argues with the fact that Costco has far less expansion potential today than it did even a decade ago. But back then, the P/E multiple was at 25.When expectations are this elevated, it leaves no margin of safety for prospective shareholders. Consequently, there is a lot more downside risk than upside.Story continuesInvestors should wait until there's a major pullback before buying. But what valuation is appropriate? Everyone's opinion is different, but I wouldn't invest unless the P/E multiple got back to the mid-20s range.A high-quality enterprisePart of the reason Costco's stock has performed so well is its strong financial performance. Net sales climbed 60% between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2023, a disruptive period of time that included the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, inflationary pressures, and rapidly rising interest rates. There are still fears about a recession these days, but Costco was still able to grow same-store sales by 5.6% in the latest quarter (Q2 2024 ended Feb. 18). This is a steady and consistent business and that has clearly deserved a premium from investors.During the previously mentioned four-year stretch, Costco's diluted earnings per share increased at a faster clip. The operating margin might look low, but the fact that the bottom line has expanded more than revenue shows that Costco can scale up. Costco's massive scale is exactly what creates its most important competitive advantage. As the world's third-largest retailer, it has unrivaled purchasing power and negotiating leverage with its suppliers. And these lower per-unit costs are passed on to shoppers in the form of low prices.However, not just anyone can shop at a Costco warehouse. The business operates a successful membership model that has an outstanding renewal rate of 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada. This also drives loyalty.Succeeding over the long term in the retail sector is the exception to the rule. Costco has established itself as a dominant presence in the industry. However, the market more than fully appreciates this, so you shouldn't buy the stock right now.Should you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?Before you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Costco Wholesale wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"1 Monster Growth Stock Up 1,500% in 10 Years Is Still a Top Buy in 2024, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-monster-growth-stock-1-140000398.html,"MercadoLibre, often described as the ""Amazon of Latin America,"" has been a phenomenal investment over the last 10 years.","MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is the largest e-commerce company in Latin America, a title that has drawn comparisons to Amazon. But the similarities run deeper. MercadoLibre may not have a cloud computing business, but it has developed an ecosystem of services that support its marketplace and create additional monetization opportunities.MercadoLibre's decision to follow the Amazon blueprint has paid off in spades for investors. The stock soared 1,500% over the last decade, compounding at an annual rate of 31%. That means $10,000 invested in MercadoLibre in March 2014 would be worth more than $152,000 today. For context, $10,000 invested in the S&P 500 at the same time would now be worth about $28,000.Despite that performance, MercadoLibre has a market capitalization of just $75 billion, making it 24 times smaller than Amazon, and select Wall Street analysts still see the company as a worthwhile investment. For instance, Marcelo Santos at JPMorgan Chase and Andrew Ruben at Morgan Stanley selected the stock as a top pick in 2024. Read on to learn more about the so-called ""Amazon of Latin America.""MercadoLibre is the e-commerce market leader in Latin AmericaMercadoLibre hosts the largest e-commerce and payments ecosystem in Latin America. In every major geography, its online marketplace tops the competition in terms of unique visitors and page views, and it accounts for about 29% of online retail sales across the region. However, Morgan Stanley expects that figure to reach 31% by 2027, meaning the company is still gaining market share.MercadoLibre's scale creates a network effect, a virtuous cycle that pulls more merchants and consumers into its ecosystem over time. That happens because each consumer makes the marketplace more valuable for merchants, and each merchant makes the marketplace more valuable for consumers. But much like Amazon, the company supercharges that flywheel with adjacent logistics support, advertising services, credit products, and payment processing.Story continuesThose adjacent solutions make its marketplace even more compelling, and MercadoLibre has been very successful across the board. It has the fastest and most extensive delivery network in Latin America, and it ranks as the third-largest digital advertiser in the region. Additionally, its financial services subsidiary (Mercado Pago) is the leading fintech platform in Argentina, Mexico, and Chile as measured by monthly active users, and the second-largest fintech platform in Brazil.MercadoLibre reported accelerating growth in the fourth quarterMercadoLibre looked strong in the fourth quarter. Total revenue increased 42% to $4.2 billion, as growth accelerated across the commerce and fintech segments, as illustrated in the chart below. Meanwhile, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income was flat at $165 million. But that was due to one-time expenses related to tax disputes from 2014 and 2022. Excluding those expenses, net income soared 166% to $383 million.The chart below shows quarterly revenue growth in the commerce and fintech segments in 2023. Notice that commerce sales accelerated sequentially throughout the year, and fintech sales accelerated sequentially in the second half of the year.Chart by author.One thing not conveyed by the chart is the momentum MercadoLibre has achieved in certain subsidiaries. Specifically, its logistics network handled a record 94.4% of shipments during the fourth quarter, up from 93.6% last year. MercadoLibre also fulfilled about 50% of shipments during the quarter, up from 43% last year. Finally, advertising services revenue growth has now exceeded 70% for seven consecutive quarters, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates.Those numbers indicate that MercadoLibre is successfully deepening its relationship with merchants, meaning the underlying network effect is indeed gaining strength.MercadoLibre shares are priced reasonably in relation to growth prospectsGoing forward, MercadoLibre has three particularly important growth engines in e-commerce, financial services, and digital advertising. To quantify those opportunities, online retail sales are forecasted to grow at 8% annually through 2032, while digital payments revenue is expected to grow at roughly 17% annually through 2031, according to Straits Research. Meanwhile, the digital advertising market is projected to grow at nearly 16% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research.To be clear, those are global estimates. Growth in Latin American may be slower given that the regional economy is expected to expand a little less quickly than the global economy, according to World Bank. Investors should also be aware that MercadoLibre generated 22% of its revenue from Argentina last year, while 53% came from Brazil and 21% came from Mexico. I mention that because the Argentine economy is currently suffering from hyperinflation.That risk notwithstanding, Wall Street expects MercadoLibre to grow revenue at 20% annually over the next five years. But there are a few reasons that estimate could be low. First, the Latin American economy may grow more quickly than expected. Second, MercadoLibre does not yet charge merchants for fulfillment services, meaning it can pull a substantial monetization lever at some point in the future. Finally, eMarketer believes the company will lead the world in ad revenue growth in 2024. That momentum could snowball as MercadoLibre gains clout in retail, much like it has for Amazon.In any case, the current valuation of 5.4 times sales looks reasonable even if the Wall Street consensus proves correct. Patient investors should feel comfortable buying a small position in this growth stock today.Should you invest $1,000 in MercadoLibre right now?Before you buy stock in MercadoLibre, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and MercadoLibre wasn’t one of them.
