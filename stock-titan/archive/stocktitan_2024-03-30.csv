Reports Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results and Business Update Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Molecular Templates, Inc. reports financial results for Q4 and full year 2023, highlighting positive clinical data for MT-6402 and MT-8421, along with a recent private placement. The company also discloses a terminated collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Positive Positive clinical data for MT-6402 and MT-8421 showcasing durable single-agent activity and potent Treg clearance, respectively. Recent $9.5 million private placement to support ongoing clinical programs. Company anticipates a cash runway into Q2 2024 after the second closing of the July 2023 Private Placement. Termination of collaboration agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb to reduce costs. Financial results for Q4 2023 show a net loss of $3.9 million, with revenues of $7.0 million and cash equivalents of $11.5 million as of December 31, 2023. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst Analysis of Clinical Trial Progress: The reported outcomes for MT-6402 and MT-8421 are noteworthy in the oncology drug development space. MT-6402's ability to activate T-cells and potentially remodel the tumor microenvironment could represent a significant advancement in treating PD-L1+ head and neck cancer. The extended duration of monotherapy activity and the lack of severe drug-related toxicities are promising signs for its efficacy and safety profile. Similarly, MT-8421's Treg depletion mechanism is an innovative approach in immuno-oncology. These developments could attract interest from larger pharmaceutical companies seeking to enhance their oncology pipelines through acquisitions or partnerships.Implications for Stakeholders: For investors, these clinical advancements suggest potential future value inflection points, such as successful phase trials or regulatory approvals. However, the termination of the collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb raises concerns about the company's ability to attract and maintain strategic partnerships, which are often important for clinical and commercial success in the biopharmaceutical industry. Financial Analyst Financial Health Assessment: The reported reduction in net loss from $22.0 million in Q4 2022 to $3.9 million in Q4 2023 reflects a significant improvement in the company's financial management. The increase in revenue, primarily from collaborative research and development agreements, is a positive indicator of the company's ability to monetize its R&D efforts. However, the cash runway into Q2 2024, extended to Q4 2024 after the recent private placement, suggests a limited financial buffer, highlighting the need for careful cash management or additional capital raising to support ongoing clinical programs.Market Impact: The financial results, combined with the clinical data, could influence the company's stock performance. While the clinical progress may provide a positive outlook, the short-term cash runway and the need for further funding could weigh on investor sentiment. The stock issuance at a price equal to the closing price on March 27, 2024, indicates a neutral market sentiment at the time of the transaction, neither undervaluing nor overvaluing the company's prospects. Market Research Analyst Competitive Landscape and Strategic Positioning: The discontinuation of the phase 1 study for MT-0169 due to slow patient enrollment underscores the competitive nature of the multiple myeloma market. It also reflects the challenges small biopharmaceutical companies face when competing with larger entities that have recently obtained approvals for new treatments. Conversely, the focus on novel therapies such as MT-6402 and MT-8421 may offer a strategic advantage by targeting unmet medical needs in oncology. These therapies' unique mechanisms could differentiate them from existing treatments and provide leverage in potential future licensing discussions or market positioning.Long-term Outlook: The company's pivot towards solid tumors with high unmet medical needs and the strategic reduction of costs following the termination of the BMS collaboration agreement may be viewed as a realignment of resources towards more promising areas. This could be a prudent move to maximize the impact of its R&D investments and improve long-term sustainability. 03/29/2024 - 08:21 AM AUSTIN, Texas, March 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Molecular Templates, Inc. (Nasdaq: MTEM, “Molecular Templates,” or “MTEM”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of proprietary targeted biologic therapeutics, engineered toxin bodies (“ETBs”), to create novel therapies with potent differentiated mechanisms of action for cancer, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Company Highlights Durable single agent activity observed with MT-6402, a PD-L1 targeting direct-cell kill agent, in heavily pre-treated patients with low PD-L1+ head and neck cancer who had progressed on multiple prior therapies including checkpoint and EGFR antibodies.Enrollment is on-going in the dose escalation study with MT-8421, a novel CTLA-4 targeting agent designed to potently deplete Tregs in the tumor environment. Unique pharmacodynamic effects demonstrating potent Treg clearance and IL-2 increases observed in patients.Recently completed $9.5 million private placement supports continued funding of clinical stage programs. Eric Poma, PhD., Chief Executive and Chief Scientific Officer of MTEM, stated, “We are very excited to see objective responses in heavily pre-treated, checkpoint-experienced head and neck cancer patients, a setting with high unmet medical need, with MT-6402. We are seeing evidence of monotherapy activity of long duration and in patients refractory to checkpoint therapy through a novel mechanism of tumor microenvironment remodeling. We believe these data demonstrate a new and potentially best-in-class approach to targeting the PD-1-PD-L1 axis.” Dr. Poma further added, “MT-8421 is currently in dose escalation as a novel direct cell-kill approach targeting CTLA-4 to potently deplete Tregs in the tumor microenvironment. Through the first dose cohort, we are already seeing promising and differentiate pharmacodynamic effects including dramatic Treg depletion in patients.” MT-6402 (PD-L1 ETB) MT-6402 was designed to activate T-cells through direct cell-kill of immunosuppressive PD-L1+ immune cells resulting in a remodeling of the tumor microenvironment.In addition, MT-6402 can deliver and induce the presentation of an MHC class I CMV antigen on tumor cells for pre-existing CD8 T-cell recognition and destruction in HLA-A*02/CMV+ patients with high PD-L1 expression on their tumors. Compelling signal of monotherapy activity with MT-6402 at higher doses in relapsed or refractory head and neck cancer (R-R HNSCC) with dose expansion study planned in low PD-L1+ R-R HNSCC patients. 10 patients with R-R HNSCC in dose escalationPatients dosed at 63, 83 (MTD), or 100 mcg/kg; median # of prior treatments of greater than 32 patients currently in responses; 1 patient (63 mcg/kg) has a confirmed PR with 70% reduction in tumor volume at cycle 18 (1 cycle = 4 weeks)1 patient (83 mcg/kg) has an uPR(37% reduction) at cycle 8 w/ reductions of 3%, 9%, and 15% across three previous cycles; the patient is on therapy in cycle 92 patients (one uPR and one 15% reduction) came off therapy for Gr1 hs-Trop elevation; guidelines now revised to allow patients to continue therapy despite advent of Gr1 hs-Trop elevation. In all instances, Gr1 hs-Trop elevations were asymptomatic and without evidence of cardiac changes. Similar troponin changes are observed in patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors.No gr 4 or gr 5 drug-related toxicities were observedPatients with responses/tumor reduction had low PD-L1 Dose expansion is on-going in patients with high PD-L1+ tumors. MT-8421 (CTLA-4 ETB) MT-8421, along with MT-6402, represents our unique approach to immuno-oncology based on remodeling the tumor microenvironment through the elimination of immunosuppressive cells and activation of CD8 T-cells.MT-8421 is designed to potently destroy CTLA-4+ Tregs via enzymatic ribosome destruction but does not have activity against low CTLA-4 expressing peripheral Tregs.Two of the three patients enrolled in the first cohort remain on study in cycle 5. Both patients show evidence of Treg clearance and T-cell activation. Enrollment is on-going in the second cohort of 48 mcg/kg for the phase I study of MT-8421. MT-0169 (CD38 ETB) MT-0169 is designed to destroy CD38+ tumor cells through internalization of CD38 and cell destruction via a novel mechanism of action (enzymatic ribosomal destruction and immunogenic cell death).A phase 1 study in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma was closed on Dec 2023 due to slow patient enrollment in the wake of multiple new approvals in myeloma. This study enrolled 14 patients and no drug-related Grade 4 or 5 adverse events have been observed. One patient with IgA myeloma who was quad-refractory was treated at 5 mcg/kg and had a stringent Complete Response for 16 cycles (1 cycle = 4 weeks) before discontinuing treatment for progression of disease.MTEM is evaluating plans to initiate an investigator sponsored study to evaluate MT-0169 in relapsed or refractory CD38+ AML patients.

The project, with up to 328 MWh capacity, aligns with Idaho Power's clean energy goals and will support the integration of wind and solar energy. Prevalon's comprehensive BESS solution includes maintenance and monitoring services, showcasing the company's expertise in energy storage solutions. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Market Analyst The agreement between Prevalon Energy LLC and Idaho Power represents a strategic move in the energy sector, particularly for the growing battery energy storage market. The commitment to a 328MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) is a substantial investment in grid resiliency and aligns with broader trends of integrating renewable energy sources into the power grid.From an energy market perspective, this project is notable for its scale and the implication that large utilities are increasingly turning to battery storage solutions to manage peak demand challenges. The integration of BESS with Idaho Power's long-term plan to incorporate over 5,000 MW of wind and solar energy indicates a shift towards sustainable energy practices and a reduction in reliance on traditional fossil fuels.Investors should note the potential for growth in companies that specialize in energy storage solutions, as this technology is critical for balancing intermittent renewable energy production. The long-term service agreement included in the contract suggests a steady revenue stream for Prevalon, which could positively impact Mitsubishi Power Americas' financial performance. Renewable Energy Consultant The utilization of Prevalon's Battery Energy Storage Platform by Idaho Power is a significant step towards achieving a 100% clean energy goal by 2045. The bespoke nature of the solution, including safety and security protocols, indicates a tailored approach to meeting the specific needs of the utility, which may set a precedent for future projects in the industry.From a renewable energy standpoint, the ability to store energy produced from wind and solar sources is essential for mitigating the variability of these resources. The BESS's capability to store and dispatch energy as needed provides a more stable and reliable grid, which is important for the adoption of renewables on a larger scale.This project's impact on the business landscape extends beyond the immediate stakeholders. It signals to the market that renewable energy and storage technologies are viable and increasingly necessary investments. As such, companies in the renewable energy sector may experience increased demand for similar storage solutions, influencing stock market valuations and investment trends. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial implications of the contract between Prevalon and Idaho Power requires a focus on the project's scale and the service agreement's duration. The financial health of Prevalon and its parent company, Mitsubishi Power Americas, could be bolstered by the predictable income from the service agreement and the potential for additional contracts as the industry grows.The investment in BESS technology is not just a revenue opportunity but also a strategic positioning within the energy sector. As demand for renewable energy sources rises, the need for energy storage solutions like those provided by Prevalon will likely increase, potentially leading to market expansion and increased shareholder value.However, investors should be aware of the capital intensity and long-term nature of such infrastructure projects, which may affect short-term liquidity but promise long-term returns. The project's success and its alignment with industry trends toward sustainability could enhance investor confidence and attract further investment in the sector. 03/29/2024 - 08:07 AM Contract further establishes Prevalon as an experienced global leader in battery energy storage solutions with over 30 projects and 3GWh of utility-scale projects deployed worldwide Agreement emerged from a competitive bidding process initiated by Idaho Power to secure resources for providing reliable, cost-effective service to its customers HEATHROW, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Prevalon Energy LLC, a Mitsubishi Power Americas company, announces it has contracted with Idaho Power for a complete Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) along with a robust long-term service agreement.

Power REIT Receives Audit Opinion with Going Concern Explanation,2024-03-29T21:42:00.000Z,Neutral,Negative,"Power REIT discloses unqualified audit opinion with a going concern paragraph in its Annual Report, maintaining financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.","Power REIT Receives Audit Opinion with Going Concern Explanation Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Power REIT discloses unqualified audit opinion with a going concern paragraph in its Annual Report, maintaining financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. Positive None. Negative Power REIT faces a going concern issue as highlighted in the audit opinion, which may raise concerns among investors about the Trust's ability to continue operating without significant changes. Financial Analyst The inclusion of a going concern explanatory paragraph in Power REIT's audited financial statements signals a potential red flag for investors and creditors. It suggests that the auditors have substantial doubt about the Trust's ability to continue its operations for a reasonable period of time, typically regarded as one year beyond the date of the financial statements. This could imply that the Trust is facing significant financial distress, liquidity issues, or uncertainties that may hamper its ability to meet its obligations.Investors should assess the Trust's cash flow projections, current market conditions and management's plans to mitigate these going concern risks. The market's reaction to such disclosures can be negative, leading to a potential decrease in stock price due to the heightened risk profile. The long-term implications could include restructuring, asset sales, or even bankruptcy if the Trust cannot stabilize its financial position.It is essential to scrutinize the footnote 3 mentioned in the release, as it likely provides more context on the Trust's financial situation and the specific factors that led to the going concern opinion. Understanding these details can help stakeholders make more informed decisions regarding their investment in or association with Power REIT. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the disclosure made by Power REIT in compliance with NYSE American LLC Company Guide Section 610(b) is a procedural necessity. It is designed to ensure transparency in the financial markets by mandating that companies publicly announce the receipt of audit opinions that contain going concern paragraphs. This requirement protects investors by providing them with critical information that could affect their investment decisions.For Power REIT, this disclosure does not represent an amendment to their financial statements or Annual Report, but it does highlight the importance of regulatory compliance and the role of auditors in safeguarding the interests of the public. Additionally, it underscores the Trust's obligation to keep stakeholders informed about its financial health and any risks that may impact its continuity. Market Research Analyst The real estate investment trust (REIT) sector is typically characterized by stable cash flows derived from rental income, which supports the sustainability of such entities. However, when a REIT like Power REIT receives a going concern note, it indicates a departure from the norm and may suggest sector-specific or company-specific challenges.An analysis of the broader market conditions, including interest rate trends, property market dynamics and competitive pressures, is important to contextualize Power REIT's situation. For instance, if the industry is facing headwinds due to economic downturns or rising interest rates, which affect property values and financing costs, Power REIT's challenges may be symptomatic of larger sectoral issues.Understanding the Trust's portfolio composition, geographic focus and tenant diversification can provide further insights into its risk exposure. Investors and analysts should compare Power REIT's performance and risk factors with its peers to gauge its relative position in the market and potential for recovery. 03/29/2024 - 05:42 PM Old Bethpage, New York, March 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Power REIT (NYSE-AMEX: PW and PW.PRA) (“Power REIT” or the “Trust”), today announced that, as previously disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed on March 29, 2024 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the audited financial statements contained an unqualified audit opinion from its independent registered public accounting firm that included an explanatory paragraph related to the Trust’s ability to continue as a going concern.

(NASDAQ: SINT) announced a public offering of its common stock to raise funds for working capital and general corporate purposes. The offering, subject to market conditions, is managed by Maxim Group and is made under an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3. Positive None. Negative The offering's completion, size, and terms are uncertain, posing risks to investors. There is a possibility of dilution for existing shareholders due to the sale of additional shares. Financial Analyst The announcement by SINTX Technologies of its intention to sell shares of common stock in a public offering is a strategic move that warrants a financial analysis. Such offerings are typically aimed at raising capital to fund ongoing operations, reduce debt, or finance expansion plans. The use of proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes suggests a broad application, which could either indicate a healthy investment into the company's growth or a need to cover operational shortfalls.One must consider the current financial health of SINTX, including its cash flow, debt levels and recent earnings reports. If the company has been performing well, this offering could be seen as an opportunity to accelerate growth. However, if financials have been weak, it might raise concerns about the company's ability to generate sufficient revenue internally. The involvement of Maxim Group LLC as the sole placement agent on a 'reasonable best efforts' basis indicates a non-firm commitment offering, which means the placement agent is not obligated to purchase any unsold shares. This could reflect a level of risk associated with the offering.The market's response to this offering will be telling. A successful offering at a favorable price could lead to a positive market reaction, while any signs of struggle might negatively impact investor confidence. The timing and size of the offering, as well as the pricing terms, will be critical factors in determining its success and the subsequent effect on the company's stock price. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the announcement by SINTX Technologies needs to be contextualized within the broader industry trends. Advanced ceramics are a key component in various high-tech industries, including medical devices, aerospace and automotive sectors. The demand for these materials is influenced by technological advancements and economic cycles.It is essential to assess the competitive landscape and the market position of SINTX. If the company has a strong market presence or unique technological advantages, the capital raised could further strengthen its position. Conversely, if the company is facing stiff competition and pricing pressures, investors may be more cautious. Additionally, the timing of the offering in relation to market conditions cannot be overlooked. A bullish market may welcome additional shares, while a bearish market could lead to an unfavorable outcome for SINTX.The offering's success will depend on investor perception of SINTX's growth prospects and the health of the advanced ceramics market. It would be prudent to monitor industry reports and forecasts to gauge the potential impact of this offering on the company's market share and financial performance in the long term. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding public offerings is a critical aspect to consider. SINTX Technologies is making the offering pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement, which allows them to sell securities to the public without the need for a separate registration for each offering. This method provides flexibility and speed in capital raising but also requires careful adherence to SEC regulations.The preliminary prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus are key documents that provide investors with information about the terms of the offering, risks involved and the company's financial condition. Potential investors and stakeholders should scrutinize these documents to understand the legal terms and conditions of the offering.It's also important to note that the offering is on a 'reasonable best efforts' basis, which means that the placement agent has agreed to use its best efforts to sell the securities, but there is no guarantee that all securities will be sold. This type of arrangement can affect the certainty of the capital to be raised and, consequently, the execution of the company's stated purposes for the offering. 03/29/2024 - 04:00 PM SALT LAKE CITY, UT, March 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SINTX Technologies, Inc.

The company increased its cash position through private placement financing, securing up to $185 million, with an initial upfront investment of $115.6 million. Topline results from the Phase 2 trial of AVTX-009 in hidradenitis suppurativa are expected in 2026, with an anticipated cash runway into 2027. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of AVTX-009, a Phase-2 ready anti-IL-1β monoclonal antibody (mAb), by Avalo Therapeutics is a strategic move that could potentially expand the company's pipeline with a new therapeutic candidate targeting inflammatory diseases. Monoclonal antibodies are engineered proteins that can bind to specific targets in the body and anti-IL-1β therapies are designed to block the activity of the interleukin-1 beta, a cytokine that plays a key role in inflammation. The financial infusion from private placement financing, amounting to $185 million, strengthens Avalo's cash position significantly, enhancing its ability to fund ongoing operations and clinical development, including the planned Phase 2 trial for hidradenitis suppurativa—a chronic skin condition.For investors, the extended cash runway into 2027 is a positive signal, suggesting a reduced risk of near-term cash crunches that could necessitate dilutive financing rounds. However, it's important to monitor the company's burn rate and how effectively the capital is allocated towards advancing AVTX-009 through the clinical trial phases. The anticipated topline results from the Phase 2 trial in 2026 will be a critical milestone, as positive data could drive the stock price up, while negative results could have the opposite effect. Medical Research Analyst The entry of AVTX-009 into Phase 2 trials for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) represents a significant advancement in Avalo Therapeutics' clinical portfolio. HS is a painful, long-term skin condition characterized by abscesses and scarring, primarily affecting areas bearing apocrine sweat glands. Current treatments for HS are limited and a successful anti-IL-1β therapy could meet a substantial unmet medical need, potentially leading to a significant market opportunity for Avalo.From a research perspective, the targeting of IL-1β is scientifically grounded, as IL-1β is implicated in the pathogenesis of HS and other inflammatory conditions. The therapeutic landscape for HS is sparse and if AVTX-009 demonstrates efficacy and safety in the upcoming trials, it could become a leading treatment option. The long-term implications for Avalo's growth and market share in the dermatology sector hinge on these clinical outcomes. Stakeholders should watch for enrollment numbers, trial progression and interim analyses as indicators of the trial's prospects. Market Research Analyst Understanding the competitive landscape of the dermatology market, particularly in the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa, is important for assessing Avalo Therapeutics' potential with AVTX-009. HS is a relatively underserved medical condition with a high burden of disease, which means there is a significant market gap for effective treatments. If AVTX-009 proves to be effective, Avalo could capture a substantial share of this niche market.However, it is important to consider the risks associated with investing in biotech companies, especially those in the clinical trial phase. The timeline until 2026 for topline results from the Phase 2 trial indicates a long waiting period for definitive data. This timeline should be factored into investment decisions, as the biotech sector is known for its volatility and investment horizons may vary among stakeholders. The company's valuation will likely fluctuate based on trial updates, regulatory news and market sentiment towards biotech investments. 03/29/2024 - 04:01 PM Acquired AVTX-009, Phase-2 ready anti-IL-1β mAb, in March 2024Increased cash position with private placement financing in March 2024 providing up to $185 million, including initial upfront investment of $115.6 millionTopline results from planned Phase 2 trial of AVTX-009 in hidradenitis suppurativa expected in 2026Expected cash runway into 2027 WAYNE, Pa. and ROCKVILLE, Md., March 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Avalo Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: AVTX), today announced business updates and year-end financial results for 2023. “We are very excited about the acquisition of AVTX-009 and concurrent financing of up to $185 million, $115.6 million of which we received upfront. The progress we made in 2023 to strengthen our balance sheet helped enable these transactions. I am proud of the team’s efforts and continued dedication in executing our strategy focused on the treatment of inflammatory conditions,” said Dr. Garry Neil, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. “Our focus in 2024 is executing operationally on the development of AVTX-009 for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa. Our experienced team is ready to hit the ground running on progressing the drug candidate and is motivated by the potential of developing a meaningful treatment for patients suffering from hidradenitis suppurativa, many of whom are searching for improved treatment options.” Corporate Updates On March 27, 2024, Avalo acquired AVTX-009, a Phase 2 ready anti-IL-1β mAb, through an acquisition of AlmataBio, Inc. The consideration included stock valued at $15 million, as well as a $7.5 million payment due upon closing of the private placement investment. Avalo is also required to pay development milestones to the former AlmataBio stockholders including $5 million due upon the first patient dosed in a Phase 2 trial in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and $15 million due upon the first patient dosed in a Phase 3 trial, both of which are payable in cash, Avalo stock, or a combination thereof at the election of the former AlmataBio stockholders. On March 28, 2024, Avalo closed a private placement led by Commodore Capital and TCGX, with participation from BVF Partners, Deep Track Capital, OrbiMed, Petrichor, and RA Capital Management for gross proceeds of up to $185 million, including $115.6 million of initial upfront funding received at close. The upfront investment is expected to fund operations through Avalo’s planned Phase 2 data readout in hidradenitis suppurativa and into 2027.As part of the private placement, the Company issued (i) an aggregate of $115.6 million of non-voting convertible preferred stock and (ii) warrants to purchase Avalo’s common stock or an equivalent amount (as converted to common stock) of non-voting convertible preferred stock for an aggregate exercise price of $69.4 million. The warrants are exercisable for approximately $5.80 per underlying share of common stock until the earlier of five years from the date of issuance or 30 days after the public announcement of the first patient dosed in a Phase 2 trial of AVTX-009 in HS. On an as-converted basis and after accounting for the financing and acquisition (excluding the exercise of the warrants), the total number of shares of Avalo common stock outstanding would be approximately 23.4 million immediately after the closing of the transactions. Program Updates and Milestones: AVTX-009: Anti-IL-1β monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting inflammatory diseases. Avalo intends to pursue the development of AVTX-009 in hidradenitis suppurativa and expects topline data from its planned Phase 2 trial in hidradenitis suppurativa in 2026.In addition to hidradenitis suppurativa, Avalo intends to develop AVTX-009 in at least one other chronic inflammatory indication. Quisovalimab (AVTX-002): Anti-LIGHT mAb targeting immune-inflammatory diseases. Avalo is conducting a strategic review of the quisovalimab program. AVTX-008: B and T Lymphocyte Attenuator (BTLA) agonist fusion protein targeting immune dysregulation disorders. Avalo is conducting a strategic review of the AVTX-008 program. 2023 Financial Update: As of December 31, 2023, Avalo had $7.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. We raised approximately $46.2 million of net proceeds from equity financings in 2023 and fully retired our original $35 million of debt with principal payments of $21.2 million, inclusive of the full payoff of the loan in September 2023. The decrease in net loss was primarily attributable to a $26.2 million decrease in operating expenses driven by significantly reduced research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses partially offset by a decrease of $14.2 million in license and other revenue. The significant reduction of research and development expenses was driven by fewer development programs ongoing during 2023 (due to divestitures in both 2022 and 2023), the AVTX-002 trial reading out in June of 2023 with no new trials initiated in the second half of the year, and a reduction of manufacturing costs due to the timing of manufacturing runs. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased due to a smaller infrastructure to support the focused pipeline, severance in 2022 that did not repeat, as well as cost savings initiatives. Net loss per share decreased as a result of the decrease in net loss and due to an increase in the shares outstanding. In March 2024, we closed a private placement financing for gross upfront proceeds of $115.6 million. Avalo estimates upfront net proceeds of approximately $105 million after deducting estimated transaction fees and expenses from both the private placement financing and the acquisition of AlmataBio. We expect future research and development expenses and cash used in operating activities to increase in 2024 as a result of our development plans to initiate and progress a Phase 2 trial in hidradenitis suppurativa. Topline results from this planned Phase 2 trial are expected in 2026 and the upfront funding is expected to fund operations through this data readout and into 2027.

About AVTX-009AVTX-009 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG4) that binds to interleukin-1β (IL-1β) with high affinity and neutralizes its activity. IL-1β is a central driver in the inflammatory process. Overproduction or dysregulation of IL-1β is implicated in many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. IL-1β is a major, validated target for therapeutic intervention. There is evidence that inhibition of IL-1β could be effective in hidradenitis suppurativa and a variety of inflammatory diseases in dermatology, gastroenterology, and rheumatology. About quisovalimab (AVTX-002)Quisovalimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb), directed against human LIGHT (Lymphotoxin-like, exhibits Inducible expression, and competes with Herpes Virus Glycoprotein D for Herpesvirus Entry Mediator (HVEM), a receptor expressed by T lymphocytes). There is increasing evidence that the dysregulation of the LIGHT-signaling network which includes LIGHT, its receptors HVEM and LTβR and the downstream checkpoint BTLA, is a disease-driving mechanism in autoimmune and inflammatory reactions in barrier organs. Therefore, we believe reducing LIGHT levels can moderate immune dysregulation in many acute and chronic inflammatory disorders. Quisovalimab previously demonstrated proof of concept in COVID-19 induced acute respiratory distress syndrome including reduction in mortality and respiratory failure, as well as a positive signal in patients with Crohn’s Disease. About AVTX-008AVTX-008 is a fully human B and T Lymphocyte Attenuator (BTLA) agonist fusion protein in the IND-enabling stage. AVTX-008 is differentiated by having specific binding to BTLA, with no binding to LIGHT or CD160. AVTX-008 also has high-serum stability and solubility. About Avalo Therapeutics Avalo Therapeutics is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the treatment of immune dysregulation. Avalo’s lead asset is AVTX-009, an anti-IL-1β mAb, targeting inflammatory diseases. Avalo’s pipeline also includes quisovalimab (anti-LIGHT mAb) and AVTX-008 (BTLA agonist fusion protein).

The company raised preferred equity to support its drilling program and is progressing towards a merger with Fury Resources. Despite a decrease in revenue and production compared to Q4 2022, Battalion remains optimistic about its operational performance and cost management. Positive Expansion of acreage with 41,000 net acres across three counties Successful drilling operations with completion of wells under budget and strong initial results Raised $55.0 million through preferred equity to support drilling program Progress towards merger with Fury Resources Management Positive net income available to common stockholders of $27.0 million for Q4 2023 Adjusted EBITDA of $10.0 million for Q4 2023 Negative Decrease in revenue and production compared to Q4 2022 Realized hedge losses totaling approximately $3.0 million in Q4 2023 Increase in lease operating and workover expenses per Boe year-over-year Increase in gathering and other expenses per Boe due to midstream disruptions and plant curtailments Increase in general and administrative expenses per Boe due to audit, legal, and transaction costs Energy Sector Analyst The recent update from Battalion Oil Corporation indicates a strategic expansion in their operations, with an emphasis on cost efficiency and production enhancement. The company's execution of a six-well program and the successful completion of wells below budget with strong initial production rates are positive indicators for operational efficiency. The mention of year-end reserves of approximately 68.1 million barrels of oil equivalent and a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of approximately $598.5 million provides a solid foundation for the company's valuation and future revenue streams.The acid gas injection (AGI) project coming online and its potential to save up to $2 million per month in gas treating costs is a significant development. This cost-saving measure, once fully operational, could materially improve Battalion's margins and profitability. The preferred equity raises totaling $55 million are also noteworthy as they demonstrate the company's ability to secure funding to support its drilling program and potentially reduce financial leverage.However, the decrease in production and revenue compared to the previous year, alongside increased per Boe expenses, signals potential operational challenges. The rise in general and administrative expenses due to the pending merger with Fury Resources suggests a short-term increase in costs that investors should monitor closely. The impact of this merger on Battalion's financials and market position will be a focal point for stakeholders. Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) Expert The proposed merger with Fury Resources Management is a pivotal event for Battalion Oil Corporation. Such transactions can lead to synergies that enhance operational capabilities and market reach, potentially leading to increased shareholder value. However, the costs associated with mergers, including audit and legal fees, can be substantial, as evidenced by the increase in general and administrative expenses per Boe. It is essential for investors to assess whether the long-term benefits of the merger justify these short-term costs.Furthermore, the net income reported for the fourth quarter, alongside the adjusted diluted net loss after selected items, presents a mixed financial picture. These figures, in conjunction with the announced equity raises, suggest that the company is actively managing its capital structure in anticipation of the merger. The outcome of this transaction will likely have significant implications for the company's financial health and strategic direction.Investors should also consider the implications of the proxy statement and other materials filed with the SEC. These documents will provide critical information about the merger's terms, the rationale behind it and how it aligns with Battalion's long-term strategy. The reaction of the stock market to these developments will be telling of the perceived value of the merger to Battalion's future. Financial Analyst Examining Battalion Oil Corporation's financial health, the reported net income of $27.0 million for Q4 2023 is a robust indicator, especially when juxtaposed with the adjusted diluted net loss of $16.6 million. This discrepancy suggests non-recurring expenses or adjustments that have impacted profitability, which stakeholders must dissect to understand the company's core earnings potential.The liquidity position, with $57.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and the total indebtedness of $200.2 million, is a critical measure of Battalion's financial stability. The company's ability to raise preferred equity not only bolsters its liquidity but also reflects investor confidence in its strategy and management. However, the cost of capital associated with preferred equity is typically higher than debt, which could affect future earnings.Investors should closely monitor the EBITDA decline from $22.7 million in Q4 2022 to $10.0 million in Q4 2023, as it reflects the company's operational performance and ability to generate cash flow from its core business activities. This decline, if indicative of a trend, could affect Battalion's ability to service its debt and fund future operations, thereby impacting its stock price. 03/29/2024 - 07:44 PM HOUSTON, March 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Battalion Oil Corporation (NYSE American: BATL, “Battalion” or the “Company”) today announced financial and operating results for the fourth quarter of 2023. Key Highlights Approximately 41,000 net acres, 91% HBP in three contiguous blocks across Ward, Winkler and Pecos Counties with substantial remaining location inventoryBrought previously announced AGI project online in Q1 2024 treating over 20 MMcf/dRecommenced drilling operations in Monument Draw in Q4 2023 to execute a six well program Completed two wells in Q4 2023, brought online in Q1 2024 under budget with strong initial resultsDrilled two additional wells in Q1 2024, currently completingCommenced drilling operations on two additional wells in Q1 2024, currently drilling ahead Generated full year sales volumes of 13,784 barrels of oil equivalent per day (“Boe/d”) (48% oil)Year-end 2023 reserves of approximately 68.1 million barrels of oil equivalent (“MMBoe”) with a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of approximately $598.5 million.Executed a $35.0 million preferred equity raise in December 2023 and an additional $20.0 million preferred equity raise in March 2024 to support drilling programContinuing strategic alternatives initiative and are working toward closing our previously announced merger agreement with Fury Resources Management CommentsDuring Q4 2023, following the preferred equity raise, the Company re-commenced its drilling operations in Monument Draw after operating a three-well pad on non-operated acreage adjacent to the asset. The company also prepared additional locations across all three asset areas to support additional activity in Ward, Winkler, and Pecos Counties. Since the quarter close, the two well Glacier pad drilled in Q4 2023 has been completed and is on production. These wells came online below budget, above projected type curve, with substantial pressure support and 30-day IP’s over 1,950 Boe/d and 1,750 Boe/d, respectively. Two additional wells (Rio Bravo pad) have been drilled to total depth and are currently being completed. The drilling rig has moved onto an additional two-well pad (Vermejo pad) in Monument Draw. All operations have been favorable to plan from both a capital and timing perspective. During the fourth quarter, workover operations for the acid gas injection (“AGI”) project were substantially completed. Since that time, the facility has restarted operations and began taking acid gas from the Company with approximately 200 MMcf being recently treated at AGI and approximately 175 MMcf of sweet gas being returned to the Company for sales to our midstream partner. As the facility continues to come online, the Company will benefit from the return to production of currently curtailed volumes of up to 750Bbl/d. Additionally, when the AGI is operating at full capacity, we expect to save up to $2.0 million per month in gas treating costs. Matt Steele, Chief Executive Officer, commented “The operations team has performed exceptionally well on our Monument Draw drilling campaign. The most recent Glacier pad wells represent some of the best the Company has ever drilled from both a cost and performance basis. Bringing the AGI back online to treat our gas represents a new era at Battalion. The difficult steps we took last year to right size the Company and focus on operational excellence are beginning to pay dividends.” Results of OperationsAverage daily net production and total operating revenue during the fourth quarter of 2023 were 12,022 Boe/d (46% oil) and $47.2 million, respectively, as compared to production and revenue of 15,696 Boe/d (51% oil) and $76.8 million, respectively, during the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 is attributable to an approximate 3,674 Boe/d decrease in average daily production and a $10.21 decrease in average realized prices (excluding the impact of hedges). Excluding the impact of hedges, Battalion realized 99.7% of the average NYMEX oil price during the fourth quarter of 2023. Realized hedge losses totaled approximately $3.0 million during the fourth quarter 2023. Lease operating and workover expense was $11.87 per Boe in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus $9.89 per Boe in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in lease operating and workover expense per Boe year-over-year is primarily attributable to a decrease in average daily production as a large portion of our lease operating expenses are fixed costs. Gathering and other expense was $13.31 per Boe in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus $11.31 per Boe in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily related to midstream disruptions and plant curtailments and an increased percentage of total production requiring H2S treatment, as well as inflationary impacts on costs associated with our own hydrogen sulfide treating plant. General and administrative expense was $4.93 per Boe in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $2.46 per Boe in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase is primarily due to audit, legal and transaction costs associated with the potential merger with Fury Resources. These costs will be substantially reduced in future quarters. For the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company reported a net income available to common stockholders of $27.0 million and net income per diluted share available to common shareholders of $1.63 per share available to common stockholders. After adjusting for selected items, the Company reported an adjusted diluted net loss available to common stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2023 of $16.6 million, or an adjusted diluted net loss of $1.01 per common share (see Reconciliation for additional information). Adjusted EBITDA during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was $10.0 million as compared to $22.7 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 (see Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation table for additional information). Liquidity and Balance SheetAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $200.2 million of indebtedness outstanding and approximately $0.3 million of letters of credit outstanding. Total liquidity on December 31, 2023, made up of cash and cash equivalents, was $57.5 million. On November 8, 2023, the Company obtained a commitment letter from its existing equity stockholders to purchase additional preferred equity securities in an amount up to $55.0 million. An aggregate of 35,000 shares of preferred stock were sold on December 15, 2023, under such support letter for proceeds of $34.1 million, net of discount. On March 27, 2024, the remaining 20,000 shares under such support letter were sold for proceeds of $19.5 million, net of discount.

The company holds $34.6 million in debt and equity securities. Negative Significant decrease in revenues due to lower COVID-19 vaccination sales. High expenses despite workforce reductions. Challenges in financial comparability due to pandemic sales surge. Financial Analyst The financial results presented by Retractable Technologies, Inc. indicate a significant revenue contraction of 54% year-over-year, which is a stark contrast to the pandemic-induced sales surge. This downturn is largely attributable to the decline in COVID-19 vaccination sales, both domestically and internationally. The company's efforts to reduce operating expenses by 29.2% and workforce reductions reflect a strategic response to the changing market conditions. However, it is important to note that despite these cost-cutting measures, the company's overhead remains elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels, suggesting that the firm's operational efficiency has not fully reverted to historical norms. From a financial perspective, the unrealized loss of $10.5 million on securities indicates a potential overexposure to market volatility or a shift in investment strategy that may not have been fully optimized. The realized gain of $5.6 million, while positive, does not offset the unrealized losses, which could be a point of concern for investors evaluating the company's portfolio management effectiveness. The adequate liquidity position and ongoing sales and development efforts are positive signs, but the overall financial health of the company will likely depend on its ability to adapt to post-pandemic market dynamics and drive growth in non-COVID-19 related product segments. Market Research Analyst The data presented reveals a shifting landscape in the medical devices sector, particularly for companies like Retractable Technologies that experienced a temporary boost from pandemic-related sales. The 78.9% plummet in international revenues underscores the volatility of relying on emergency sales for growth. It is essential for the company to diversify its product portfolio and strengthen its core business to mitigate the risks associated with such volatility. The retention of inventory by customers suggests a potential overestimation of ongoing demand, which could have led to excess production and subsequent revenue declines. Moreover, the absence of sales to the U.S. government in 2023 compared to the significant volume in 2021 raises questions about the company's reliance on government contracts and its ability to secure similar deals in the future. The market will be closely watching Retractable Technologies' ability to navigate the post-pandemic environment and the success of their new product development will be critical for future revenue streams and market positioning. Investment Analyst Analyzing the company's financials, the sharp decrease in gross profit from $95.4 million in 2021 to $9.1 million in 2023 suggests a significant reduction in profitability, reflecting the end of a pandemic-driven high-margin product cycle. The company's strategy to invest in securities has resulted in a sizable portfolio, but the unrealized loss raises questions about the alignment of this strategy with the company's core operations and risk profile. Investors should consider the long-term sustainability of Retractable Technologies' revenues beyond the scope of pandemic-related products. The company's focus on new product development is a positive step, yet the execution and market acceptance of these products will be pivotal. The current financials may not be indicative of future performance, especially as the company attempts to stabilize its operations in a normalizing market. Careful scrutiny of the company's investment activities and the performance of new products will be essential for understanding its future growth potential and risk exposure. 03/29/2024 - 03:20 PM LITTLE ELM, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Retractable Technologies, Inc. (NYSE American: RVP) reports the following information relating to the year ended December 31, 2023. Further details concerning the results of operations as well as other matters are available in Retractable’s Form 10-K filed on March 29, 2024 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Our revenues for 2023 decreased 54.0% as domestic and international COVID-19 vaccination sales decreased. We had revenues of approximately $43.6 million as compared to approximately $94.8 million in the prior year. Domestic revenues decreased 33.7% and international revenues decreased 78.9%. In addition to the decline in demand for COVID-19 vaccination products, we experienced a decline in demand which may be due to customer retention of inventory from prior periods. Cost of manufactured product decreased 49.0% due to a decline in units sold and operating expenses decreased 29.2% primarily due to the lack of stock option expense in 2023. Comparability of 2023 to 2020-2022 financial results is challenging due to the unusual volume of pandemic sales. Below is a table which details our revenues as well as gross profit, total operating expenses, and income or loss from operations since 2018. As previously reported, a 2020 agreement with the U.S. government enabled us to significantly expand our facilities but increased our overhead costs in recent years. In 2022 and 2023, we reduced our workforce in an effort to reduce our expenses, but expenses remain higher than prior to 2020.

In addition, the Company has continued investing in securities. We purchased a net amount of $9.9 million in securities during 2023, resulting in ownership of $34.6 million in debt and equity securities by year-end. Our income statement reflects an unrealized loss of $10.5 million and a realized gain of $5.6 million on our debt and equity securities.

The company aims to expand wave energy technology globally with key projects in Israel, the US, and Portugal. Positive Impressive 1,076% revenue growth and 36% decrease in net loss showcase Eco Wave Power's financial resilience in 2023. Securing grants like the Innovate UK grant and other funds bolsters the company's financial position and project development. Successful grid connection in Israel, investment agreement for the US project, and license approval in Portugal mark significant milestones for Eco Wave Power. Feasibility studies conducted for various projects worldwide indicate the company's commitment to exploring new markets and opportunities. Financial overview reveals a decrease in operating expenses and a net loss reduction of 36% compared to 2022, ending the year with $8.4 million in cash and deposits. CEO's positive outlook for 2024, despite clean energy stock market challenges, emphasizes the company's belief in its technology and future growth potential. Negative Clean energy stock market challenges and underperformance of WAVE stock reflect broader sector trends and economic uncertainties. R&D expenses expected to increase significantly due to upcoming projects, potentially impacting overall financial performance. Despite positive financial indicators, the company's market cap remains below its cash position, indicating investor caution. CEO's disappointment in WAVE stock performance highlights potential concerns among shareholders despite the company's financial stability. Financial Analyst The recent financial results reported by Eco Wave Power Global AB indicate a substantial revenue increase of 1,076% and a significant decrease in net loss by 36%. These figures suggest a positive trajectory for the company's financial health and operational efficiency. The revenue growth is particularly noteworthy as it excludes funds from grants and other sources, implying that the core business operations are scaling effectively. However, the company's operating expenses saw a decrease, which may reflect cost-saving measures or a strategic realignment of resources.It's essential to assess the liquidity position, with the company ending the year with $8.4 million in cash and deposits. This liquidity is critical for funding ongoing projects and potential expansions. The performance bond issued in Portugal demonstrates a commitment to delivering the commercial wave energy project, which could be a pivotal milestone for the company and the industry. Moreover, the strategic co-investment agreement for the U.S.-based project indicates confidence from major industry players and may serve as a catalyst for future growth.Investors should also consider the broader market context. The underperformance of clean energy stocks, as mentioned by the CEO, suggests sector-specific challenges that could affect investor sentiment. Nonetheless, the company's progress and strategic partnerships, coupled with global initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act, could position it favorably in the long term if market conditions improve and the focus on renewable energy intensifies. Energy Sector Analyst The strategic developments reported by Eco Wave Power, such as the grid connection of the EWP-EDF One Project in Israel and the investment agreement for the Port of Los Angeles project, are indicative of the company's operational progress in the wave energy sector. The successful connection to the national grid in Israel is a significant milestone, reflecting the company's capability to deliver on its technological promises and may serve as a proof of concept for potential clients and investors.The legislative support in California, with the signing of Senate Bill 605, provides a favorable regulatory environment for wave energy, which could benefit Eco Wave Power's project in the Port of Los Angeles. This regulatory tailwind, combined with the final license acquisition in Portugal, underscores the company's ability to navigate complex regulatory landscapes, a critical factor for expansion in the energy sector.However, the feasibility studies conducted for major energy companies like Shell and Chevron signal the company's intent to diversify its client base and explore new applications for its technology, potentially reducing reliance on project-specific revenue. This diversification strategy could mitigate risks associated with the construction and implementation of large-scale projects, which are often subject to delays and increased costs. Sustainability Investment Advisor The financial results and operational achievements of Eco Wave Power align with the growing trend towards sustainable and renewable energy investments. The company's focus on wave energy, an underexploited renewable resource, positions it within a niche market with significant growth potential. The emphasis on decarbonization and profitability addresses the dual investor interest in environmental impact and financial returns.The CEO's commentary on the disappointing performance of WAVE stock, despite positive operational progress, highlights the discrepancy that can exist between company performance and stock market valuation. It also reflects the current market dynamics where clean energy stocks have struggled, potentially offering a more attractive entry point for long-term investors who believe in the sector's future.The planned stock repurchase program signals management's confidence in the company's valuation and future prospects. This action could be perceived positively by the market, as it often indicates that the company's leadership believes the stock is undervalued. Investors with a focus on sustainability and long-term growth in the renewable energy sector may find Eco Wave Power's recent developments and future outlook align with their investment criteria. 03/29/2024 - 01:59 PM The Company Announces 1,076% Revenues Increase, 36% Decrease in Net Loss, an Investment Agreement with a Major Energy Company for its Port of Los Angeles Project, and the Securing of Final License for the Construction of its First Commercial Project in Portugal STOCKHOLM, March 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Eco Wave Power Global AB (publ) (""Eco Wave Power"" or the ""Company"") (Nasdaq: WAVE), a leading, publicly traded onshore wave energy technology company, today announced that it has filed its annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the ""Annual Report"") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""). The Annual Report, which contains Eco Wave Power's audited consolidated financial statements, can be accessed on the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov as well as via the Company's website in the section titled SEC Filings. Management Commentary The economic landscape in 2023 was marked by unpredictability and numerous challenges. At the year's start, both consumers and economists braced for a possible recession. Despite these worries, Eco Wave Power demonstrated resilience by increasing its revenues by 1076% (not including funds from grants and other sources) and decreasing its net loss by 36% (compared to 2022), ending the year with $8.4 million in cash and deposits. In 2023, Eco Wave Power won the Energy Catalyst Round 10 Innovate UK grant (as part of a consortium including Toshiba, Hitachi, University of Manchester, the University of Exeter, the Queen Mary University of London and others) to design a pilot microgrid project for remote islands. The total amount of the grant is GBP 1,499,644 (approximately $1.9 million), out of which Eco Wave Power's share will be GBP 456,500 (approximately $580 thousand). Additional funds were received from other grants, such as the GREENinMED grant funded by the European Union, the ILIAD Consortium grant as part of the European Union's Green Deal, and from the Energy Catalyst round 8 program of Innovate UK.Although the Company's cash burn rate substantially decreased, Eco Wave Power demonstrated significant and instrumental progress with all its key projects:- In Israel, we successfully connected the EWP-EDF One Project in the Port of Jaffa to the national electrical grid, marking the first time in the history of Israel that wave energy officially connected to the National Electrical Grid, through a Power Purchase Agreement. Since then, the project has been supplying electricity harnessed from the power of the waves to the Israeli national electric grid. An opening ceremony for the project will be held as soon as situation in Israel enables it.- At the Port of Los Angeles, in January 2024, we signed a strategic co-investment agreement with a major Energy Company (full name disclosed in the 20F report), for the implementation of our first U.S-based project while we are also moving forward with the licensing process. We have submitted our comprehensive project engineering plans to the port authorities and have formally requested the final required licenses from both the Port of Los Angeles and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. As soon as licenses are received, we expect a very short implementation time of around 6 months for our first U.S. project. In addition, in early October 2023, the Governor of California, Gavin Newsom, signed into law California Senate Bill 605 (""SB 605""), landmark legislation for wave energy in the United States. We believe that SB 605 underscores the potential of wave energy to offer both economic and environmental advantages, and it is anticipated to facilitate the progression of our project while also fostering the development of other prospective initiatives across the country.- In Portugal, we received the final approval necessary for the commencement of the construction works of our first commercial-size project in Porto (TURH license) from APDL Port Authority. As a result, we have issued a performance bond to APDL, meant to solidify our commitment for the construction of the first commercial wave energy project within a 2-year period. We believe this will be the first wave energy project in the world to show significant energy production from the power of the waves.In 2023, Eco Wave Power also conducted several feasibility studies that enabled us and our clients to explore new markets for wave energy implementation. Among such studies, we have performed a U.S. feasibility study for Shell MRE, a feasibility study for installing our wave energy technology on offshore gas drilling platform for Chevron Corporation, a feasibility study ordered by Jesa Group for a commercial project in Morocco, and a feasibility study and detailed project planning performed for Rogan Associates for a commercial scale project in Greece.In December 2023, Eco Wave Power submitted an official request to the Financial Supervisory Authority of Sweden (""SFSA""), to receive an authorization for the repurchase of American Depositary Shares corresponding to up to 10 percent of the total number of shares in the Company, which is the maximum amount permitted by the Swedish Law. The Company plans to proceed with the repurchase action as soon as such approval is granted.CEO commentary: The economic landscape in 2023 was marked by unpredictability and numerous challenges. At the year's start, both consumers and economists braced for a possible recession. When faced with such challenges, we, at Eco Wave Power, understood that we must adapt and learn how to navigate through the turbulence, and have learned over the past year that adaptability is a cornerstone of success in business, especially in today's rapidly changing economic landscape. Our adaptation process worked, and we were able to demonstrate our resilience by increasing our revenues by 1,076% (not including funds received from grants and other sources) and decreasing our net loss by 36% (compared to 2022) ending the year with $8.4 million USD in cash and deposits. Although the Company's burn rate of cash has decreased substantially, we were able to achieve significant milestones, such as the grid connection of our Israeli Project, an investment agreement with a major energy company for our first U.S. project at the Port of Los Angeles and the securing of the final license for our first commercial-scale project in Portugal, that is expected to be finalized within a period of two years. We have also reinforced our financial position by providing feasibility studies and project planning engineering services, in addition to applying for and securing multiple grants. While Eco Wave Power had an eventful year, in the financial markets, clean energy stocks, including WAVE Stock, did not perform well, as we believe high interest rates and lagging efforts to combat climate change have impacted the sector. According to CNN, Plug Power shares have slipped 63% this year, Enphase Energy shares have plunged 60%, SolarEdge Technologies shares have declined 71% and NextEra Energy shares have slid 29%, showing that even the largest and most resilient energy companies have taken a hit by the financial situation in 2023. Even considering the above, we strongly believe that with the recovery in the economic landscape, and other positive initiatives, such as The Biden administration's sweeping Inflation Reduction Act (which since its passage, announced more that 270 new clean energy projects, with 132 billion USD in private investments), there will be a significant opportunity for investors in the renewable energy market. We believe that renewable energy, and wave energy in particular, is a significant part of the world's future, and offers a significant opportunity for decarbonization, combined with profitability. In fact, Peter Krull, director of sustainable investments at Earth Equity Advisors, that manages a portfolio that focuses on stocks in industries from alternative energy to battery technology to green transportation sees the current rut in clean energy stocks as a buying opportunity for investors. I would like to finish by saying that as the founder and CEO of Eco Wave Power, and one of the largest shareholders of WAVE stock, I am disappointed by the performance of the WAVE stock on the financial market (the company's market cap is currently below its cash position). However, at the same time, I would like to say that since the incorporation of the company, none of the founders of the company have sold any shares as we believe strongly in the Company, and I am very pleased to share that we believe the Company is financially stable and resilient, and has enough funding, expertise, and support from strategic partners to procced with the execution of its upcoming projects in the Port of Los Angeles, in Portugal and in other places. I believe in Eco Wave Power's team, in Eco Wave Power's technology, and in the global ambition to fight climate change. As a result, we are looking forward to receiving the Financial Supervisory Authority of Sweden's approval to purchase back up to 10% of the company's stock on Nasdaq, to reinstate our belief in our company and our technology. I am looking forward to an amazing 2024, filled with performance and operational progress! 2023 Financial Overview Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased by $280,000, or 1,076%, to $306,000 compared to $26,000 in 2022, with 2023 revenue related to feasibility study services provided in connection with feasibility studies in the United States, Israel and Morocco.Operating expenses were $2.7 million, down by 25% from 2022.- Research and development (""R&D"") expenses decreased by $379 thousand, or 42%, to $519,000 compared to $898,000 in 2022.

First-in-Disease Use of Kyverna Therapeutics' KYV-101 in Patients With Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Published in Med,2024-03-29T18:59:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Kyverna Therapeutics, Inc. announces successful treatment of two multiple sclerosis patients with KYV-101, a fully human anti-CD19 CAR T-cell product candidate, in Germany. The treatment showed an acceptable safety profile, opening doors for larger clinical studies.","First-in-Disease Use of Kyverna Therapeutics' KYV-101 in Patients With Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Published in Med Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Kyverna Therapeutics, Inc. announces successful treatment of two multiple sclerosis patients with KYV-101, a fully human anti-CD19 CAR T-cell product candidate, in Germany. The treatment showed an acceptable safety profile, opening doors for larger clinical studies. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The administration of KYV-101 to patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) represents a noteworthy development in the field of autoimmune disease treatments. The observed safety profile, notably the absence of early neurotoxicity, is a positive indicator for the potential scalability of this treatment. However, it is important to consider that these results are preliminary and derived from a very small sample size. A larger cohort will be necessary to validate these findings and fully understand the efficacy and safety of KYV-101.From a research perspective, the mechanism of action of anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, which involves genetically modifying a patient's T-cells to target specific proteins on the surface of B-cells, is a significant shift from traditional MS therapies that often focus on immunosuppression. The success of this approach could lead to a paradigm shift in MS treatment, potentially improving the quality of life for patients who do not respond to existing therapies. Healthcare Industry Analyst Kyverna Therapeutics' progress with KYV-101 could have meaningful implications for the company's valuation and the broader market for autoimmune disease treatments. The current treatment landscape for MS is competitive, with several established players. If KYV-101 advances through clinical trials and demonstrates superior safety and efficacy, it could capture a significant market share. However, the path to market for novel therapies is fraught with regulatory hurdles and commercialization challenges.Investors should monitor subsequent trial results closely, as they will provide more substantial data to assess the commercial prospects of KYV-101. Furthermore, as Kyverna is a clinical-stage company, its financial health is heavily reliant on the progression of its pipeline. The successful development of KYV-101 could attract partnership opportunities, licensing deals, or even make Kyverna a target for acquisition by larger pharmaceutical companies seeking to expand their portfolios in the immunotherapy space. Biotech Financial Analyst While the initial results for KYV-101 are promising, the financial implications for Kyverna Therapeutics hinge on the outcomes of larger, controlled clinical trials. The biotech sector is known for its volatility, especially for companies like Kyverna that are in the clinical-stage with no products currently on the market. The investment required to bring a drug from discovery to market is substantial and Kyverna will likely need to secure additional funding, which could come at the cost of share dilution or strategic partnerships.For stakeholders, the key metrics to watch in the upcoming months will include trial enrollment rates, speed of regulatory submissions and any early indicators of efficacy from expanded studies. The market's response to these developments will be telling, as positive data could lead to stock price appreciation, while any setbacks could have the opposite effect. Caution is advisable until more data is available, but the potential for KYV-101 to address an unmet need in MS therapy could represent a significant upside. 03/29/2024 - 02:59 PM Two patients were treated with KYV-101, a fully human anti-CD19 CAR T-cell product candidate, in Germany as part of a named patient program after failure to respond to conventional therapies The treatment resulted in an acceptable safety profile, with no observed clinical signs of early neurotoxicity, warranting larger clinical studies in subjects with multiple sclerosis EMERYVILLE, Calif., March 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Kyverna Therapeutics, Inc. (Kyverna), a patient-centered, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing cell therapies for patients suffering from autoimmune diseases, announces today the publication in Med1, of a report describing the first use of KYV-101, a fully human anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell product candidate, in two patients suffering from progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) as part of a named patient program for critically ill patients after both patients failed to respond to conventional therapies. ""We are very pleased about offering this potentially paradigm-shifting treatment opportunity to patients that have exhausted other medical recourses,"" said Christoph Heesen, M.D., professor for clinical and rehabilitative MS research at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in Hamburg, Germany, and senior co-author. ""Emerging findings indicating that this approach may affect disease biology in the central nervous system are promising, as preventing disease progression remains one of the most difficult challenges in MS therapy."" ""Exploring the safety profile of CAR T administration in this population and hopefully establishing that it compares favorably to hematopoietic stem cell transplant may bring the cell therapy approach to a larger number of patients in need,"" said Nicolaus Kröger, M.D., professor of Medicine and medical director, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in Hamburg, Germany, and senior co-author. ""If safe administration can be replicated in other patients and efficacy be formally established in clinical trials, this may bring a relevant therapeutic option to patients with MS."" ""We are committed to transforming the standard of treatment for patients living with multiple sclerosis,"" said Peter Maag, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Kyverna. ""The pioneering work done with KYV-101 by medical teams in Hamburg and in our trials in the U.S. helps build the data backbone needed to further advance our knowledge and hopefully accelerate development of CAR T-cell therapies in autoimmune diseases."" CAR T-cell therapy involves modifying a patient's T cells to recognize and remove B cells in the patient's body. CD19 CAR T-cell therapy specifically targets CD19, a protein expressed on the surface of B cells, which are involved in various types of autoimmune diseases. About Multiple sclerosis (MS)Multiple sclerosis is a chronic neurodegenerative autoimmune disease affecting over 2.8 million individuals worldwide2. It affects more frequently women, people of Northern European descent, and is also associated with certain environmental and genetic factors. Patients with MS can experience a range of symptoms including blurred vision, slurred speech, tremors, numbness, extreme fatigue, problems with memory and concentration, and, in severe cases, the inability to walk or stand.Current disease-modifying treatments for MS aim to reduce the frequency of disease relapses and delay progression of disability, but the disease remains a chronic condition that will progressively worsen for most patients. About KYV-101KYV-101 is an autologous, fully human CD19 CAR T-cell product candidate for use in B cell-driven autoimmune diseases. The CAR in KYV-101 was designed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to improve tolerability and tested in a 20-patient Phase 1 trial in oncology. Results were published by the NIH in Nature Medicine3. KYV-101 is currently being evaluated in sponsored, open-label, Phase 1/2 trials of KYV-101 in patients with lupus nephritis, an autoimmune disease in which more than half of patients do not achieve a complete response to current therapies and are at risk of developing kidney failure. Additionally, FDA's IND clearance has been obtained for Phase 2 trials of KYV-101 for multiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis, and a Phase 1/2 trial for systemic sclerosis. We believe that the differentiated properties of KYV-101 are critical for the potential success of CAR T cells as autoimmune disease therapies. KYV-101 is also being evaluated in investigator-initiated trials for multiple indications in multiple geographies. About Kyverna TherapeuticsKyverna Therapeutics (NASDAQ: KYTX) is a patient-centered, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing cell therapies for patients suffering from autoimmune diseases. Our lead CAR T-cell therapy candidate, KYV-101 is advancing through clinical development with sponsored clinical trials across two broad areas of autoimmune disease: rheumatology and neurology, including Phase 2 trials for multiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis, a Phase 1/2 trial for systemic sclerosis, and two ongoing multi-center, open-label Phase 1/2 trials in the United States and Germany for patients with lupus nephritis. Kyverna's pipeline includes next-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies in both autologous and allogeneic formats with properties intended to be well suited for use in B cell-driven autoimmune diseases.

TherapeuticsMD continues to evaluate strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. Negative None. Financial Analyst The shift in TherapeuticsMD's business model from a commercial pharmaceutical entity to a royalty-based one is a significant restructuring that has led to a substantial reduction in operating expenses. The 85.4% decrease in total operating expenses is a remarkable change. However, this must be weighed against the net loss from continuing operations of $7.7 million. The company's ability to manage its cash reserves, which stand at $4.3 million, is important in sustaining operations and pursuing strategic alternatives. Investors would likely monitor the company's cash burn rate closely, as well as any potential increases in license revenues that could offset losses. Market Research Analyst TherapeuticsMD's exploration of strategic alternatives indicates a potential pivot in company strategy that could affect the market's perception and valuation of the firm. The uncertain outcome of this process could introduce volatility into the stock's performance. The company's transparency regarding the lack of a set timeline for this exploration process could be a double-edged sword, providing flexibility for strategic maneuvering while potentially causing investor unease due to the open-ended nature of the outcome. Market observers would be particularly interested in any acquisition, merger, or business combination that could significantly alter the company's market positioning and financial trajectory. Pharmaceutical Industry Analyst The reported net license royalties of $1.3 million, against a backdrop of gross license royalties of $4.5 million, reflect the company's reliance on the performance of its licensed products. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and the success of royalty-based models often hinges on the market performance of the products to which a company holds rights. The $3.0 million of gross minimum royalty payments under the Mayne License Agreement suggests a baseline revenue stream; however, the growth of this stream is contingent on product sales exceeding minimum thresholds. Industry peers and investors would assess the sustainability of TherapeuticsMD's royalty income in comparison to industry norms and the potential for growth in product sales. 03/29/2024 - 04:00 PM • Evaluation of strategic alternatives continues BOCA RATON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TherapeuticsMD, Inc. (“TherapeuticsMD” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: TXMD), a company that owns rights to pharmaceutical royalties, today reported financial results for the full year ended December 31, 2023. “We continue to explore a variety of strategic alternatives with the goal of maximizing value for our shareholders,” stated Marlan D. Walker, Chief Executive Officer of TherapeuticsMD. Full Year 2023 Financial Results Net Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Net loss from continuing operations was $(7.7) million, or $(0.74) per basic and diluted common share, compared to net income from continuing operations of $1.1 million, or $0.12 per basic and $0.11 per diluted common share, for 2022. License and Service Revenues from Continuing Operations Gross license royalties totaled approximately $4.5 million under the Mayne License Agreement for the full year ending December 31, 2023. Included in this amount are $3.0 million of gross minimum royalty payments paid under the Mayne License Agreement. The Company recognizes license revenue only on amounts in excess of the gross minimum royalty amounts earned under the Mayne License Agreement. Our net license royalty income is allocated and reported in revenue, net and other income based on the proportion of the sales from each of our licensed products. Based on sales of our licensed products, the Company recognized $1.3 million in revenue, net and approximately $0.5 million in other income in the year ending December 31, 2023 related to net license royalties. Total Operating Expenses from Continuing Operations Total operating expenses from continuing operations for 2023 were $9.8 million, a decrease of $57.6 million, or 85.4%, compared to 2022, primarily attributable to lower general and administrative expenses due to the transition of the Company’s business from a commercializing pharmaceutical business to a royalty-based business. Evaluation of Strategic Alternatives The Company continues to evaluate a variety of strategic alternatives that may include, but not be limited to, an acquisition, merger, other business combination, sale of assets, or other strategic transactions involving the Company. Although the Company is exploring potential strategic alternatives, there can be no assurance of a transaction, a successful outcome of these efforts, or the form or timing of any such outcome. The Company has not set a timetable for completion of this exploration process and does not intend to disclose further developments unless and until it is determined that disclosure is appropriate or necessary. Balance Sheet As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $4.3 million.

(Nasdaq: TELO) and Argenta to conduct a study on the efficacy of Telomir-1 in treating osteoarthritis in canines. The study aims to evaluate the potential of Telomir-1 to mitigate the clinical signs of osteoarthritis and other age-related diseases, with the possibility of extending its use to humans. Telomir-1 could offer a disease-modifying therapy for canines, enhancing their quality of life and mobility. Positive Telomir Pharmaceuticals, Inc. partners with Argenta to study Telomir-1's efficacy in treating osteoarthritis in canines. Telomir-1 may potentially address age-related conditions in canines and humans through telomere regeneration. The study aims to evaluate Telomir-1's impact on symptomatic, radiographic, and histopathologic evaluations of osteoarthritis in canines. Telomir-1 could provide a disease-modifying therapy for canines with osteoarthritis, offering a potential treatment where current options only manage symptoms. Negative None. Veterinary Medicine Expert The partnership between Telomir Pharmaceuticals and Argenta to study Telomir-1's impact on canine osteoarthritis is a significant step in veterinary medicine. The focus on telomere lengthening as a potential treatment is a novel approach. Telomeres, which are protective caps at the end of chromosomes, tend to shorten as organisms age, leading to cellular aging and associated diseases. If Telomir-1 can effectively lengthen telomeres, it may not only slow down the progression of osteoarthritis but also improve overall cellular health in canines.Considering the large number of dogs affected by osteoarthritis and the limitations of current treatments, which are mainly symptomatic, a successful outcome from this study could disrupt the market for canine osteoarthritis treatments. It's important to note that while the study's success could pave the way for human trials, translating results from animal models to humans is complex and not always straightforward. Biotech Industry Analyst From an industry perspective, Telomir Pharmaceuticals' strategic collaboration with Argenta could be a smart move to leverage Argenta's expertise in animal health research. This could expedite the study and potentially enhance the credibility of the results. The focus on a disease-modifying therapy is particularly interesting as it addresses the root cause rather than just managing symptoms. This could set a new standard in the treatment of age-related diseases.The stock market often reacts positively to announcements of innovative treatments entering the study phase, especially when they target conditions with high prevalence and unmet medical needs. However, investors should be aware that this is still a pre-clinical study and there are several regulatory hurdles and a long road ahead before potential commercialization. The mention of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application indicates a forward-looking strategy but does not guarantee FDA approval or market success. Pharmaceutical Regulatory Expert The regulatory pathway for a novel drug like Telomir-1 is complex and requires rigorous evaluation of both efficacy and safety. The fact that Telomir Pharmaceuticals is already considering an IND application to the FDA suggests confidence in their pre-clinical data. However, the transition from animal studies to human trials is a critical juncture, with many compounds failing to demonstrate the same level of efficacy or safety in humans.For stakeholders, the potential benefits are substantial if Telomir-1 proves to be safe and effective in humans. However, the risks associated with investing in pre-clinical stage companies should not be underestimated. The drug development process is fraught with challenges and many candidates never make it to market. The long-term implications for Telomir Pharmaceuticals will depend on successful clinical trials and the ability to navigate the regulatory environment effectively. 03/29/2024 - 04:44 PM Study to determine the efficacy of Telomir-1 on mitigating the clinical signs of osteoarthritis and other age-related diseases This study is believed to be the first and only known study focused on reversing aging in canines BALTIMORE, March 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Telomir Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:TELO) (“Telomir” or the “Company”), a pre-clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of Telomir-1 as the first novel small molecule to lengthen the DNA’s protective telomere caps in order to potentially address age-related conditions, today announced that Telomir and global animal health contract research, development and manufacturing organisation Argenta have agreed to begin a three to six-months study on the efficacy of Telomir-1 as a treatment for osteoarthritis and other diseases of aging in canines. The study will evaluate the efficacy of Telomir-1 for mitigating the progression of osteoarthritis based on symptomatic, radiographic, gross pathologic and histopathologic evaluations. In addition, Telomir believes that this study could be used as part of its pre-clinicial program for eventually evaluating Telomir-1 in humans. It is estimated that nearly 18 million canines in the United States are affected by osteoarthritis. Of those, only one third of the afflicted canines have a confirmed diagnosis and are being treated for the disease. Current treatments only address the symptoms of osteoarthritis, using behavioral therapies like weight management and pain medications such as NSAIDs and injectables. “Osteoarthritis is the most common ailment in canines yet there are currently no treatments that combat the disease. As with human osteoarthritis, medical professionals are limited to treatments that only help manage the symptoms,” stated Chris Chapman, MD, Co-founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Telomir Pharmaceuticals. “Working with Argenta, a leading worldwide animal health research company, this study has the potential to demonstrate both the efficacy of Telomir-1 as well as a benign safety profile. We believe that Telomir-1 will offer an attractive treatment for this indication. Just as important, we believe that the results of this trial could be used to enable our submission of an Investigation New Drug Application to the FDA to study the potential effect of Telomir-1 on osteoarthritis in humans.” “Based on our initial research, we believe that Telomir-1 can offer an effective disease-modifying therapy that enhances the quality of life and mobility for canines with osteoarthritis,” commented Dr. Michael Roizen, Special Advisor on Age Reversal to Telomir Pharmaceuticals. “As with human indications, we believe that Telomir-1 may have the potential to treat age-related conditions in canines through telomere regeneration as we believe it may enable the production of more stem cells which essentially may allow the body, in effect, to repair itself.” To be added to the Telomir Pharmaceuticals email distribution list, please email telomir@kcsa.com with TELO in the subject line. About Telomir Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Telomir Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:TELO) is a pre-clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of Telomir-1 as the first novel small molecule to lengthen the DNA’s protective telomere caps in order to potentially reverse age-related conditions. Telomeres are the protective end caps of a chromosome made up of DNA sequences and proteins. As humans age, telomeres shorten, with metal reactivity accelerating the process, which presents us with an increased chance of contracting a number of degenerative and age-related diseases. Telomir’s goal is to develop and commercialize Telomir-1 (which is proposed to be dosed orally) for hemochromatosis (iron overload) and ultimately post-chemotherapy recovery and a broader range of other age-related inflammatory conditions such as osteoarthritis. The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute (Sweden) awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2009 for the discovery of how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase.

The current status does not affect the listing of the company's shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Positive None. Negative Risk of non-compliance with Nasdaq listing rules due to delayed annual report filing Financial Analyst The notification of non-compliance received by Jiuzi Holdings Inc. from the Nasdaq Stock Market is a significant indicator of potential governance or operational issues within the company. Investors often perceive such news negatively, as it may reflect underlying problems such as financial discrepancies, lack of internal controls, or even potential solvency issues. The company's failure to file its annual report in a timely manner could raise red flags about its financial health and transparency.While the immediate impact on the stock's listing status is minimal, the long-term consequences could include investor skepticism, increased volatility in the stock price and possibly a hit to the company's reputation. The market often reacts to uncertainty and this development could lead to a decline in investor confidence until the company provides the overdue financial disclosures and demonstrates a clear path to compliance. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the receipt of a Deficiency Letter from Nasdaq is a procedural step in enforcing listing standards, which are important to maintaining the integrity of the market. Jiuzi Holdings Inc. must now craft a Compliance Plan that convincingly addresses the reasons for the delay and outlines measures to prevent future occurrences.If the Compliance Plan is accepted, the extension granted could provide the company with a valuable window to rectify its reporting issues without the immediate threat of delisting. However, if the plan fails to satisfy Nasdaq's requirements, the company could face delisting proceedings, which would have serious repercussions for its ability to raise capital and for shareholders' liquidity. Market Research Analyst Within the context of the new energy vehicle (NEV) market in China, timely and accurate financial reporting is essential for assessing a company's position in this highly competitive and rapidly evolving industry. The delay in filing the annual report by Jiuzi Holdings Inc. deprives stakeholders of critical information needed to evaluate the company's performance against its peers, market trends and regulatory changes in the NEV landscape.Analyzing the potential impact on the company's market share and growth strategy is challenging without current financial data. The situation is compounded by the fact that NEV dealerships are heavily reliant on consumer trends, government policies and technological advancements, making the need for transparency and regular financial updates even more pertinent for investors and industry observers. 03/29/2024 - 04:05 PM HANGZHOU, China, March 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jiuzi Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: JZXN; the ""Company"" or “JZXN”), an emerging new energy vehicle (NEV) dealership group operating under the brand name ""Jiuzi"" in China, announced today that it has received a letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market, dated March 25, 2024 (the “Deficiency Letter”), notifying the Company that it is not in compliance with the requirements for continued listing set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) because it did not timely file its annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended October 31, 2023 (the “2023 Annual Report”). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company has 60 calendar days from the date of the Deficiency Letter to submit a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules (the “Compliance Plan”). If Nasdaq accepts the Compliance Plan, Nasdaq may grant the Company an extension until September 10, 2024 to regain compliance. The Company intends either to file its 2023 Annual Report or submit the Compliance Plan within the prescribed 60-day period. The Deficiency Letter has no immediate impact on the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market.

Repurchases can occur through open market or private transactions, block trades, or pursuant to trading plans. The program allows flexibility based on market conditions, stock price, financial performance, and alternative capital uses. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Share repurchase programs are a common strategy used by companies to manage capital allocation and signal confidence in the company's future prospects. TrustCo's decision to repurchase up to 200,000 shares represents an assertion by management that the stock is undervalued and that investing in their own shares is a good use of capital. This can be a positive signal to investors, as it often leads to an increase in earnings per share and return on equity, assuming the repurchased shares are retired.However, it's important to look at the broader context. The repurchase amount, being about 1% of outstanding shares, is relatively modest and might not have a significant impact on the market price or the company's capital structure. Investors should consider the company's historical performance, current valuation and other investment opportunities available to TrustCo. If the company forgoes investment in growth opportunities in favor of repurchases, this could be seen as a lack of viable projects to invest in, which might be a concern in the long term. Market Research Analyst When assessing the potential impact of a stock repurchase program, it's essential to consider the industry trends and market conditions. For a bank like TrustCo, factors such as interest rate environment, regulatory changes and economic forecasts can significantly influence the stock's performance. If the market conditions are favorable and the banking sector is expected to perform well, the repurchase program could be well-timed to capitalize on future growth.Moreover, investor sentiment often reacts positively to repurchase announcements, as it's perceived as a vote of confidence by the company's leadership. However, the timing and execution of the buybacks will determine the actual impact on the stock's liquidity and volatility. The flexibility of the program, allowing for repurchases over the next twelve months, gives TrustCo the ability to adapt to changing market conditions, which is a prudent approach. Legal Expert It's important to understand the legal framework governing stock repurchase programs. TrustCo's program is structured to comply with Rule 10b5-1, which provides a safe harbor for companies and their management when conducting stock buybacks. This rule is designed to protect against potential insider trading allegations by allowing companies to set up predetermined trading plans when they are not in possession of material nonpublic information.Compliance with legal requirements, including the timing, volume and manner of repurchases, is vital to avoid regulatory scrutiny. The disclosure that the program may be suspended, terminated, or modified at any time for various reasons is a standard precautionary statement that protects the company from future legal challenges if changes to the program are deemed necessary. 03/29/2024 - 04:00 PM GLENVILLE, N.Y., March 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TrustCo Bank Corp NY (TrustCo, Nasdaq: TRST) today announced that its Board of Directors has approved a stock repurchase program.

Repurchases will be made at management’s discretion over the next twelve months at prices management considers to be attractive and in the best interests of both TrustCo and its stockholders, subject to the availability of stock, general market conditions, the trading price of the stock, alternative uses for capital, and TrustCo’s financial performance. Open market purchases will be conducted in accordance with applicable legal requirements. The repurchase program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason, including market conditions, the cost of repurchasing shares, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, liquidity, and other factors deemed appropriate.

The company plans to notify the NYSE of its intent to cure the deficiency, which may involve a reverse stock split. Despite the notice, the Common Stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE. The company reassures shareholders that the notice has no immediate impact on its business operations or reporting obligations. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The notification received by MultiPlan Corporation from the NYSE regarding non-compliance with the minimum price criteria is a significant event that warrants attention from investors. The stipulation that the company's stock must maintain an average closing price of at least $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period is a standard requirement for continued listing. Falling below this threshold is often seen as a red flag, indicating potential underlying financial or operational weaknesses.From a financial perspective, the company's consideration of a reverse stock split to cure the deficiency suggests a proactive approach to maintaining its listing status. However, such a move can have mixed implications. On one hand, it could improve the perceived market value of the stock by increasing the price per share, potentially attracting institutional investors who may avoid stocks under a certain price. On the other hand, it could also be viewed as a cosmetic change that does not address the fundamental reasons for the stock's decline. Investors should closely monitor the company's performance metrics and management's execution of its Growth Plan to assess the likelihood of sustainable improvement in stock value. Market Research Analyst Market perception following a notice of non-compliance can vary. In some cases, it may lead to increased volatility as traders react to the perceived risk of delisting. For MultiPlan Corporation, the emphasis on continuing to trade on the NYSE and the assurance that business operations and reporting obligations remain unaffected is critical. It's important to note that the company's strategic focus on its Growth Plan and commitment to shareholder value could mitigate some of the negative sentiment surrounding the notice.Investors should consider the broader industry context when evaluating MultiPlan's situation. If the company operates in a sector experiencing overall challenges, the stock price issue might be symptomatic of sector-wide trends rather than company-specific problems. Conversely, if the sector is thriving, the company's inability to maintain the minimum stock price might be more concerning. Additionally, investor sentiment and confidence can be influenced by the company's transparency and communication regarding the steps it will take to regain compliance. 03/29/2024 - 04:30 PM – Company has six months to regain compliance with the minimum price criteria for continued listing on the NYSE – Company remains focused on executing its Growth Plan and on delivering results and shareholder value NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MultiPlan Corporation (NYSE: MPLN) (“MultiPlan” or the “Company”) announced today that it received notice (the “Notice”) on March 28, 2024 from the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) that, as of March 27, 2024, it was not in compliance with the continued listing standard set forth in Section 802.01C of the NYSE’s Listed Company Manual (“Section 802.01C”) because the average closing price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock (the “Common Stock”) was less than $1.00 per share over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.

Key metrics like passengers, revenue passenger miles, and load factor show steady growth year over year.","ALLEGIANT REPORTS FEBRUARY 2024 TRAFFIC Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT) reported preliminary passenger traffic results for February 2024, showcasing strong demand trends. Despite a slightly lower TRASM than expected due to a weak lead up to Spring Break, second-quarter capacity adjustments aim to optimize performance. Key metrics like passengers, revenue passenger miles, and load factor show steady growth year over year. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent report from Allegiant Travel Company presents a mixed picture of their operational performance, with a marginal increase in passengers and revenue passenger miles (RPMs), but a slight decline in load factor. This indicates a moderate growth in demand, which is essential for revenue, but the decrease in load factor could suggest inefficiencies in capacity management or a mismatch between supply and demand.From a market perspective, the capacity reduction in April by 10% year over year, aligned with the Easter shift, reflects a strategic adjustment to seasonal demand patterns. This is a common practice in the airline industry to avoid excess capacity during lean periods. However, the normalization of capacity in June to levels seen in 2018 could signal cautious optimism about summer travel demand.It's noteworthy that the preliminary financial results show a decrease in estimated average fuel cost per gallon for Q1 2024 compared to February 2024. Fuel costs are a significant expense for airlines and fluctuations can have a substantial impact on profitability. Investors should monitor how these costs will affect Allegiant's margins and overall financial performance in the coming quarters. Financial Analyst Allegiant's report indicates a slight sequential increase in Total Revenue per Available Seat Mile (TRASM) of 0.5% from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024. While this growth is positive, it fell short of initial expectations, potentially impacting investor sentiment. The company's acknowledgment of weaker-than-expected performance leading up to the Spring Break period can be seen as a short-term headwind, though the emphasis on continued demand strength could mitigate concerns.Investors should also consider the impact of the scheduled capacity reduction in April and the alignment of June aircraft utilization with 2018 levels. These operational adjustments could be a strategic move to optimize seasonal capacity and maintain profitability. However, the proof will be in the actual performance figures and whether these adjustments lead to improved financial outcomes.The disclosed fuel costs also offer a glimpse into operational expenses. With the first quarter's estimated average fuel cost per gallon being lower than that of February, there could be some cost savings. However, fuel prices are volatile and any future increases could quickly erode these savings. Aviation Industry Analyst The airline industry is highly sensitive to economic cycles, consumer behavior and seasonal trends. Allegiant's performance in February and the projections for Q1 and Q2 2024 reflect these dynamics. The modest increase in passengers year over year and the slight dip in load factor could suggest that while Allegiant is attracting more customers, it's not maximizing capacity utilization as efficiently as it might.Understanding the importance of the load factor is important for stakeholders. It measures the percentage of available seating capacity that is filled with passengers and is a critical indicator of an airline's efficiency. Allegiant's reported decrease in load factor, even if slight, could point to potential revenue losses per flight.Moreover, the decision to adjust capacity and aircraft utilization based on seasonal demand is indicative of Allegiant's agility in responding to market conditions. The airline industry often requires such flexibility to remain competitive, especially for a company like Allegiant, which positions itself with lower base airfares. Their ability to adapt to the 'Easter shift' and project demand into the summer will be essential for their operational and financial health. 03/29/2024 - 04:37 PM LAS VEGAS, March 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ: ALGT) today reported preliminary passenger traffic results for February 2024. ""First quarter demand continued the trend of outperformance during peak weeks offset by a normalized off-peak demand profile,"" stated Drew Wells, Allegiant chief revenue officer. ""Unitized revenue during the last two weeks of March exceeded prior year, highlighting continued demand strength. First quarter TRASM will come in slightly lower than initial expectations, up roughly .5 percent sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2023. This is predominantly due to a slightly weaker than expected lead up to the Spring Break period. While we communicated the shift of Spring Breaks to the back half of the month, results were softer than we anticipated in those few lead up weeks. Second quarter capacity considers this normalization with April capacity down 10 percent year over year, accounting for the Easter shift forward. Additionally, June aircraft utilization is currently on par with 2018 levels to optimize capacity during our seasonally strong summer peaks. Early bookings into June, coupled with peak demand trends observed during the first quarter, suggest continued demand strength into peak summer travel periods.""

(NASDAQ:SCWO) announces collaborations with DIU, Arcadis, and Clean Earth to advance PFAS remediation for defense sites and a new contract with the City of Orlando. Financially, the company reported a 75% decrease in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, along with increased operating expenses. Operational highlights include a new contract with Orlando and participation in environmental initiatives in Africa's Great Lakes region. Positive Collaboration with DIU, Arcadis, and Clean Earth for PFAS remediation and a contract with Orlando. Revenue decreased by 75% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Total Operating Expenses increased due to building the pipeline and technology commercialization. Working capital increased to $13,528,000 as of December 31, 2023. New contract with Orlando for deploying an AirSCWO 6 service unit. Participation in environmental initiatives in Africa's Great Lakes region. Expected deployment to Orange County Sanitation District in the first half of 2024. Transitioning to a larger manufacturing facility and building a C-Suite for business scaling. Negative Revenue decline of 75% for the year. Increase in Total Operating Expenses. Delays in deployment to Orange County Sanitation District. Transition process to a larger manufacturing facility may pose operational challenges. Financial Analyst The reported 75% decrease in year-over-year revenue for 374Water Inc. is a significant downturn, indicative of challenges in the sales cycle or market adoption rates. The revenue decline from $3,016,000 to $744,000, despite ongoing operations and manufacturing efforts, suggests a potential reassessment of the company's sales strategy or market position may be necessary. The increase in operating expenses, particularly in Compensation and Related, as well as General and Administrative, reflects an investment in workforce and marketing, which the company justifies by its focus on future growth and customer acquisition. However, investors should be vigilant about the company's ability to convert these expenditures into revenue-generating opportunities.Furthermore, the positive working capital growth from $7,061,000 to $13,528,000 offers a cushion that may enable the company to weather the downturn and continue its operations without immediate liquidity concerns. This financial buffer could be critical for long-term strategies, such as the completion of the transition to a larger manufacturing facility and the appointment of a permanent CEO, which could streamline operations and catalyze growth. The contract with the City of Orlando and the involvement in the environmental initiative with DIU are promising developments, yet their impact on the bottom line will be more accurately assessed in future financial reports. Environmental Technology Expert The integration of the AirSCWO 6 service unit into Orlando's Iron Bridge Water Pollution Control Facility is a noteworthy application of 374Water's technology, offering the potential to process significant volumes of sludge and enhance operational efficiency. The technology's ability to treat no less than 400 metric tons of sludge monthly reflects its scalability and potential impact on waste management practices. The collaboration with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) to address PFAS contamination is of environmental significance, as PFAS are known for their persistence and potential health risks. The deployment of advanced treatment technologies like AirSCWO could position 374Water as a key player in the field of environmental remediation.Moreover, the Homa Bay Blueprint initiative demonstrates the company's commitment to social impact, targeting improved health and ecological conditions in Africa's Great Lakes region. The involvement of multiple stakeholders, including governmental and educational institutions, underscores the collaborative approach necessary for impactful environmental projects. While these initiatives are promising in terms of corporate responsibility and technological validation, their direct financial impact remains to be quantified in subsequent operational results. 03/29/2024 - 04:05 PM Announced Collaboration with DIU, Arcadis and Clean Earth to Advance PFAS Remediation for Defense SitesAnnounced new contract with City of OrlandoDURHAM, NC / ACCESSWIRE / March 29, 2024 / 374Water Inc.

Cash and cash equivalents stood at $12.9 million as of December 31, 2023, up from $6.2 million in 2022. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results of Elicio Therapeutics indicate a year-over-year increase in research and development (R&D) expenses, which is a common occurrence for clinical-stage biotechnology companies focused on advancing their product pipelines. The increase in general and administrative (G&A) expenses is attributed to the costs associated with operating as a public company post-reverse merger. Investors should note that such increases are expected as the company scales up its operations and enters more advanced stages of clinical trials.Another point of interest is the net loss per share decrease, which is largely due to the increase in the weighted average common shares outstanding following the reverse merger. This dilution effect is typical following such corporate actions and should be considered when evaluating the company's performance and future prospects. The cash and cash equivalents position has improved, which is critical for the company's ability to fund ongoing trials without immediate additional capital raising, thereby potentially reducing near-term dilution risk for current shareholders. Medical Research Analyst From a medical research perspective, the clinical progress of Elicio's lead vaccine candidate, ELI-002, is noteworthy. The vaccine is targeting a significant unmet medical need in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a notoriously difficult-to-treat cancer with limited effective therapies. The initial data showing a correlation between T cell response and relapse-free survival (RFS) is promising and suggests that ELI-002 may have a meaningful impact on patient outcomes if these results can be replicated in larger studies.The fact that the data monitoring committee confirmed the recommended Phase 2 trial dose without safety concerns is a positive sign for the ongoing trials. However, it's important to remain cautious as many therapies that show promise in early-stage trials do not always translate into success in later stages or gain regulatory approval. Oncology Clinical Trial Expert The progression of Elicio's vaccine candidate into a randomized Phase 2 trial is a significant milestone. The design of this trial, focusing on patients with KRAS-mutated PDAC, targets a specific patient population that could benefit most from the therapy. The use of biomarker-driven endpoints, such as tumor biomarker responses and biomarker clearance, is indicative of a precision medicine approach that is increasingly favored in oncology trials.Moreover, the publication of Phase 1a data in a prestigious journal like Nature Medicine adds credibility to the research and can increase visibility among the scientific community. It's essential for investors to monitor the enrollment and data readouts from these trials, as positive results could lead to significant value inflection points for the company. 03/29/2024 - 08:30 AM ELI-002 2P clinical immunogenicity data were accepted for a poster presentation at the AACR Annual Meeting 2024ELI-007 and ELI-008 preclinical data were accepted for a poster presentation at the AACR Annual Meeting 2024Phase 2 randomized trial in PDAC is underway with enrollment expected to complete in the fourth quarter of 2024ELI-002 7P initial clinical trial data expected in the second quarter of 2024Private placement with gross proceeds of $6.0 million closed in March 2024 BOSTON, March 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Elicio Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ELTX,“Elicio Therapeutics” or “Elicio”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a pipeline of novel immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, today reported financial results for the year ending December 31, 2023, and provided recent business highlights. “2023 was a momentous year for Elicio with the completion of a successful reverse merger, presenting clinical data from our first-in-human trial and advancing ELI-002 into a randomized Phase 2 trial,” said Robert Connelly, Elicio’s Chief Executive Officer. “Already in 2024 we have built on 2023’s progress with our Phase 1a clinical data being published in Nature Medicine and announcing the first patients were dosed in the randomized Phase 2 trial. We continue to focus on advancing our lead cancer vaccine candidate, ELI-002, and the progression of our randomized Phase 2 study as a monotherapy for patients with PDAC. We have an exciting year ahead as we expect to share data from the AMPLIFY-7P Phase 1 study of ELI-002 7P in the second quarter.” Corporate Updates AMPLIFY-7P Phase 1a: Completed enrollment of 14 patients in the third quarter of 2023 with initial clinical data for ELI-002 7P expected in the second quarter of 2024.The independent data monitoring committee completed the safety review of ELI-002 7P Phase 1 trial patients and confirmed the recommended Phase 2 trial dose. AMPLIFY-7P Phase 2: First patients dosed in a randomized Phase 2 study of ELI-002 7P, an investigational therapeutic cancer vaccine, administered as an adjuvant monotherapy treatment for patients with KRAS-mutated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (“PDAC”). AMPLIFY-201 Phase 1a: Data from the first-in-human study of ELI-002 2P published in Nature Medicine shows: The data were as of September 6, 2023, based on 25 patients with solid tumors (20 pancreatic, 5 colorectal) who were positive for minimal residual mKRAS disease after locoregional treatment.Direct ex vivo mKRAS-specific T cell responses were observed in 21/25 patients (84%; 59% both CD4+ and CD8+).Tumor biomarker responses were observed in 21/25 patients (84%) and biomarker clearance in 6/25 patients, as determined by tumor-informed circulating tumor DNA (24%; 3 pancreatic, 3 colorectal).At 8.5 months median follow-up the median RFS of the 25-patient cohort was 16.33 months.Efficacy correlated with T cell response (≥ versus < median: 12.75-fold over baseline):Median tumor biomarker reduction was -76.0% compared to -10.2% in above versus below median T cell responders, respectively (p<0.0014).Median RFS was not reached compared to 4.01 months in above versus below median T cell responders, respectively (HR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.63, p=0.0167).Patients with greater than median T cell response had an 86% reduction in the risk of progression or death.The association of RFS with T cell response was not correlated to baseline prognostic variables including tumor stage, recovery from prior cytotoxic therapy as assessed by absolute neutrophil count or immune system subsets such as %CD4+ or %CD8+ of CD3+ lymphocytes.RFS was shorter in patients who began treatment with a low absolute lymphocyte count.No safety concerns were identified, and no dose limiting toxicities and no ≥ grade 3 treatment related adverse events were observed. 2023 Financial Results R&D expense for 2023 was $23.8 million, compared to $18.1 million for 2022. The increase in R&D expense was primarily due to increased manufacturing and clinical trial expenses as Elicio initiated the AMPLIFY-7P Phase 1a study and generated a clinical trial product to supply the ongoing Phase 2 trial. G&A expense for 2023 was $11.9 million, compared to $5.6 million 2022. The increase in G&A expense was primarily attributable to professional fees, personnel expenses, and insurance associated with operating as a public company. Net loss for 2023 was $35.2 million, compared to $28.2 million for 2022. Net loss per share for 2023 was $6.96 compared to $89.27 for 2022.

By combining expertise in immunology and immunotherapy, Elicio is engineering investigational Amphiphile (“AMP”) immunotherapies intended to precisely target and fully engage the lymph nodes, the site in our bodies where the immune response is orchestrated. Elicio is engineering lymph node-targeted AMPlifiers, immunomodulators, adjuvants, and vaccines for an array of aggressive cancers. About the Amphiphile Platform Our proprietary Amphiphile (“AMP”) platform delivers investigational immunotherapeutics directly to the “brain center” of the immune system – the lymph nodes. We believe this site-specific delivery of disease-specific antigens, adjuvants and other immunomodulators may efficiently educate, activate, and amplify critical immune cells, potentially resulting in the induction and persistence of potent adaptive immunity required to treat many diseases. In preclinical models, we have observed lymph node-specific engagement driving therapeutic immune responses of increased magnitude, function, and durability. We believe our AMP lymph node-targeted approach will produce superior clinical benefits compared to immunotherapies that do not engage the lymph nodes based upon preclinical studies. Our AMP platform, originally developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has broad potential in the cancer space to advance a number of development initiatives through internal activities, in-licensing arrangements or development collaborations and partnerships. The AMP platform has been shown to deliver immunotherapeutics directly to the lymph nodes by latching on to the protein albumin, found in the bloodstream, as it travels to lymphatic tissue. In preclinical models, we have observed lymph node-specific engagement driving immune responses of increased magnitude, function, and durability.

We are pleased to see the positive results coming from the successful acquisition and integration of Range Environmental Resources and Range Natural Resources, which provide traditional mine reclamation and incidental mining services, and Collins Building & Contracting which provides abandoned mine land reclamation,” stated Cavanaugh. “As part of our long-term growth strategy, during 1Q 2024 we have repositioned our Range Environmental business to focus on larger, longer-term mine projects, transitioned our Range Natural mining operations to a subcontractor model to achieve greater scale with less capital investment, and allocated more employees and equipment to several recently-awarded and more seasonal abandoned mine land jobs through Collins Building.” “As a result of these strategic initiatives, we anticipate revenue for 1Q 2024 to be approximately $3.5 million, which compares favorably to revenue for 1Q 2023 of $3.0 million, and a full year 2024 revenue target similar to full year 2023 levels.” Cavanaugh added, “We are very excited about the progress we are making to develop long-term revenue streams for our company, and look forward to sharing future updates with shareholders throughout the upcoming year.” Non-GAAP Financial Information In addition to our results under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), in this release we also present certain other supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”). We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expenses related to restricted stock grants and stock options issued to directors and employees and consultants, and any one-time non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA is one of the primary metrics used by management to evaluate our financial performance, analyze the effectiveness of our business strategies, and make budgeting and capital allocation decisions. However, this non-GAAP measure does have certain limitations and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), earnings (loss) per share or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP.

Failure to comply may lead to delisting from Nasdaq.","Caravelle International Group Announces Receipt of Nasdaq Deficiency Notice Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Caravelle International Group (Nasdaq: CACO) received a notice from Nasdaq regarding non-compliance with filing its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended Oct 31, 2023. The company has 60 days to submit a compliance plan to Nasdaq, with a possible extension of 180 days. Failure to comply may lead to delisting from Nasdaq. Positive None. Negative Possible delisting from Nasdaq if compliance is not regained in time. Market Research Analyst The notice received by Caravelle International Group regarding its non-compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) could have a ripple effect on investor confidence. Typically, when a company delays its financial reporting, it raises concerns about the potential discovery of accounting irregularities or operational issues. Investors may become wary, which can lead to increased volatility in the company's stock price. The company's commitment to rectify the situation is positive, but until the actual filing and content of the report are reviewed, uncertainty remains. The impact of this notice should be monitored closely as it could influence not only Caravelle's stock but also the broader ocean technology sector, which relies on investor trust and transparent financial disclosures. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the delay in filing the Annual Report could signal underlying financial difficulties or complexities within Caravelle International Group. The market reacts to uncertainty and such delays often result in a negative perception, potentially affecting the stock's performance. If the company's plan to regain compliance is not accepted by Nasdaq and the stock is delisted, it would significantly reduce the stock's liquidity and accessibility, deterring institutional investors and potentially leading to a lower stock price. On the other hand, if the company manages to file within the grace period and the report does not reveal any significant issues, the stock could recover quickly. Analyzing the company's past financial health and the industry's financial reporting standards could offer insights into what to expect when the report is finally released. Legal Expert The legal implications of Caravelle's non-compliance with Nasdaq's reporting requirements are serious. The company's securities may face delisting, which is a complex legal process with implications for shareholder rights and the company's ability to raise capital.

The G700 offers increased range, speed, and cabin comfort, setting new industry standards. Positive Gulfstream G700 receives FAA type certification for customer deliveries. Performance improvements include shorter takeoff and landing distances. Range increased to 7,750 nautical miles at Mach 0.85 or 6,650 nm at Mach 0.90. Maximum operating speed raised to Mach 0.935, the fastest in the Gulfstream fleet. Cabin altitude reduced to 2,840 ft while flying at 41,000 ft, enhancing passenger comfort. G700 features whisper-quiet noise levels, panoramic windows, and fresh air circulation. General Dynamics, the parent company, generated $42.3 billion in revenue in 2023. Negative None. Aerospace Engineer The certification of Gulfstream's G700 by the FAA is a significant milestone in aerospace engineering, particularly in the business aviation sector. The confirmed performance enhancements regarding the balanced field length and landing distance not only exceed the initial projections but also optimize the aircraft's operational efficiency. These improvements could potentially lead to reduced fuel consumption and lower operating costs, which are key factors in the competitive landscape of business jets. Additionally, the increased range and speed capabilities of the G700 position it as a leading contender in the long-range business jet market, potentially influencing fleet composition decisions for corporate and private operators. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the G700's advanced features, such as the reduced cabin altitude and whisper-quiet noise levels, address the growing demand for enhanced passenger comfort and wellbeing during flight. This is particularly relevant in the luxury segment, where differentiation is often driven by customer experience. The G700's entry into the market could capture a significant share of high-net-worth individuals and corporate clients, leading to an increase in sales for Gulfstream. Moreover, the timing of the certification and delivery could influence General Dynamics' stock performance, as investors often react positively to the successful launch of new products that promise to drive future revenue streams. Financial Analyst Examining the financial implications, the G700's certification may have a positive impact on General Dynamics' financial performance. The development and certification process of a new aircraft requires substantial investment and reaching this point allows the company to begin recouping those costs through customer deliveries. The enhancements in performance and comfort could justify a premium pricing strategy, potentially leading to higher profit margins. Investors should monitor the adoption rate of the G700 in the market, as it could serve as an indicator of General Dynamics' future financial health. However, it is also important to consider the capital expenditure and research and development costs associated with such advancements and the time required to achieve a return on investment. 03/29/2024 - 10:31 AM All-New G700 Certified with Even More Performance Enhancements SAVANNAH, Ga., March 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of General Dynamics (NYSE: GD), today announced the all-new Gulfstream G700 has received Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) type certification, paving the way for customer deliveries of the most spacious aircraft in business aviation.

""We have successfully completed the most rigorous certification program in company history with the G700,"" said Mark Burns, president, Gulfstream. ""I'd like to thank our world-class team of flight test, certification and engineering professionals, along with the many others at Gulfstream who have contributed to this accomplishment. The G700 brings a new level of performance and cabin comfort to business aviation and is doing so while meeting the highest certification standards our industry has ever seen."" In September 2023, Gulfstream announced G700 performance enhancements for range, speed and cabin altitude. The aircraft's range increased to 7,750 nautical miles/14,353 kilometers at Mach 0.85 or 6,650 nm/12,316 km at Mach 0.90, gaining 250 nm/463 km at both speeds over original projections. The G700's maximum operating speed increased from Mach 0.925 to Mach 0.935, making it the fastest in the Gulfstream fleet. Along with the range and speed increases, Gulfstream announced that the G700 cabin altitude, already the lowest in business aviation, was further reduced to 2,840 ft/866 m while flying at 41,000 ft/12,497 m, providing even more comfort for passengers. The G700 cabin also features whisper-quiet noise levels, 20 Gulfstream Panoramic Oval Windows and 100% fresh, never recirculated air. ""I would also like to extend my thanks to the FAA G700 certification team for their support,"" said Burns. ""On behalf of Gulfstream's more than 20,000 employees worldwide, I am proud and excited to begin our G700 customer deliveries.""

Oncology Research Analyst The recent updates on ADG126, a masked anti-CTLA-4 SAFEbody, are particularly significant for the field of oncology, especially for metastatic microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC), a subset of CRC that has traditionally been difficult to treat with immunotherapy. The reported clinical benefits and the expanded phase 2 trial indicate a potential advancement in therapeutic options. The introduction of a higher 20 mg/kg loading dose regimen is a strategic approach to rapidly achieve therapeutic drug levels, which may improve initial response rates and potentially extend survival benefits. However, it is essential to monitor the long-term outcomes and side effects associated with higher dosing frequencies.Moreover, the technology's versatility, as evidenced by collaborations with Exelixis and Sanofi, could lead to further innovation in antibody-based therapies. This versatility, along with a robust cash balance, positions Adagene to potentially sustain operations and fund research through 2026, which is reassuring for investors. The financial stability may also allow for more aggressive development strategies without the immediate need for additional capital raises. Biotechnology Market Analyst Adagene's strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical giants like Exelixis, Sanofi and Roche underscore the commercial potential of their SAFEbody precision masking technology. The milestone payment from Exelixis and the financial terms of the collaboration with Sanofi reflect the industry's confidence in Adagene's platform. Furthermore, the potential milestone payments of up to $2.5 billion with tiered royalties from Sanofi suggest significant future revenue streams if the candidates reach commercialization.From a market perspective, the successful advancement of ADG126 and other candidates in Adagene's pipeline could capture a sizeable market share in the antibody therapeutics space. The company's approach to addressing safety and efficacy challenges, as seen with ADG206, could set a new standard for immunotherapy treatments. However, the long development timelines typical of biotech must be considered, with pivotal data not expected until 2024. Thus, while the near-term impact on the stock may be limited, the long-term potential for growth is considerable, contingent upon successful clinical outcomes. Financial Analyst Adagene's announcement has several financial implications. The company's cash balance of approximately $110 million, which is projected to fund operations into 2026, suggests a lower risk of dilutive financing in the near term. This financial runway is critical for a clinical-stage biotechnology company as it provides the necessary buffer to reach key milestones without the immediate pressure of fundraising. However, investors should be aware that clinical trials are inherently risky and any setbacks could impact the company's financial position and stock performance.The partnerships and milestones achieved with industry leaders not only validate Adagene's technology but also provide non-dilutive capital, which is favorable for current shareholders. Investors will likely focus on the upcoming clinical data readouts, as positive results could lead to an increase in stock valuation due to the potential impact on future earnings. It's important to monitor the company's burn rate and any changes in the projected cash runway, as these are critical factors in assessing the company's financial health. 03/29/2024 - 09:00 AM - Data for masked anti-CTLA-4 SAFEbody® ADG126 (muzastotug) highlight best-in-class therapeutic index and demonstrate clinical benefits in metastatic microsatellite-stable (MSS) colorectal cancer (CRC) with higher, more frequent and repeat dosing of anti-CTLA-4 therapy in combination with anti-PD-1 - - Ongoing combination phase 2 dose expansion in MSS CRC increased to over 50 patients, including initiation of a new, unprecedented 20 mg/kg loading dose regimen, with data anticipated during 2024 - - Validation of SAFEbody masking technology by Exelixis and Sanofi showcases versatility of platform across modalities including antibody-drug conjugates, bi-specific and monoclonal antibodies - - Cash balance of approximately US$110 million funds streamlined operations into 2026 - SAN DIEGO and SUZHOU, China, March 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Adagene Inc. (“Adagene”) (Nasdaq: ADAG), a platform-driven, clinical-stage biotechnology company transforming the discovery and development of novel antibody-based therapies, today reported financial results for the full year 2023 and provided corporate updates. “The SAFEbody precision masking technology platform remains at the core of our value proposition given its ability to enhance next generation antibody-based therapies that span modalities, including bispecific T-cell engagers and antibody-drug conjugates, both areas where a wider therapeutic index is needed to fully address solid tumors,” said Peter Luo, Ph.D., Chairman, CEO and President of R&D at Adagene. He continued, “Turning to our clinical pipeline, we remain steadfast in our belief that anti-CTLA-4 therapy can be reimagined as a cornerstone of cancer care by enabling higher, more frequent and repeated doses in combination with anti-PD-1 and other therapies. With our SAFEbody platform, we have a 30-fold improved therapeutic index for ADG126 and a mechanism enabling CTLA-4 mediated intratumoral Treg depletion. We are taking anti-CTLA-4 therapy to a new level unleashing this proven immunotherapy where safety has limited its therapeutic potential.” “In particular, our new loading dose regimen in late-stage MSS CRC patients enables our masked anti-CTLA-4 therapy to reach a high initial concentration, close to the steady state of activated species within the tumor tissue to immediately engage the CTLA-4 pathway and stop the tumor from aggressive growth. This loading dose strategy, together with repeated maintenance doses at 10 mg/kg showing limited treatment-related grade 3 and no higher toxicities with minimal late-onset toxicities for ADG126, is expected to engage the CTLA-4 target consistently, thereby maintaining and sustaining clinical benefit, via both the initial response rate and prolonged survival benefit. We look forward to reporting more clinical results for the ADG126 combination dose expansion in MSS CRC later this year.” PIPELINE HIGHLIGHTS Phase 1b/2 data for ADG126, a masked anti-CTLA-4 SAFEbody targeting a unique epitope of CTLA-4 on regulatory T cells (Tregs) in tumor tissue as driven by the fundamental biology of CTLA-4, showed a potential best-in-class profile in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab)*, in MSS CRC, PD-1 experienced and PD-L1 low tumors: Results presented at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Gastrointestinal (GI) Symposium from dose escalation and dose expansion cohorts of ADG126 in combination with pembrolizumab (200 mg/Q3W) demonstrated a differentiated safety profile for ADG126 at doses from 6 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg in heavily pre-treated advanced/metastatic patients (N=46): Limited dose-dependent toxicities were observed.Grade 3 TRAEs occurred in 5/46 patients (10.8%), with no Grade 4 or 5 TRAEs and a discontinuation rate of 6.5% (3/46). In dose escalation across tumor types, two partial confirmed responses (PRs) were observed among the three patients treated with ADG126 10 mg/kg Q3W, which triggered expansion cohorts at this dosing regimen. One of the patients had PD-1 refractory cervical cancer and the other had endometrial cancer. Both confirmed PRs are sustained after more than one year with repeat dosing while maintaining robust safety profiles.In dose expansion of patients with MSS CRC, 12 evaluable patients without liver metastases were treated at the active, potent dose of 10 mg/kg Q3W: Two confirmed PRs were observed in nine of these patients without peritoneal and liver metastases, resulting in an overall response rate of 22% in this subset.An additional seven of these nine patients experienced stable disease (SD) for an overall disease control rate of 100% (2 PRs and 7 SD).Observation of these clinical activities triggered further expansion into the second stage of the Simon’s 2-stage design for this dose level. In a preliminary progression-free survival (PFS) analysis of those MSS CRC patients free of liver and peritoneal metastasis, a median PFS of seven months was observed in those treated with ADG126 10 mg/kg at two dosing frequencies pooled together [every three weeks (n=9) and every six weeks (n=6)]. The durable clinical activity of ADG126 in combination with pembrolizumab will continue to be evaluated as a larger cohort of subjects becomes evaluable at the 10 mg/kg Q3W dose level.Following the ASCO GI Symposium, Adagene announced progress and expansion of the ADG126 clinical program, which increases the ongoing phase 2 dose expansion in MSS CRC to over 50 patients. Updates included: Enrollment of 12 additional patients in the second stage of the Simon’s 2-stage design was completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 for the ongoing phase 2 dose expansion cohort evaluating ADG126 10 mg/kg Q3W in combination with pembrolizumab in MSS CRC. These Part 2 results will supplement data from Part 1 of the dose expansion in MSS CRC as recently presented at the 2024 ASCO GI Symposium.Given the ADG126 safety profile, evaluation of the 20 mg/kg loading dose regimen has been initiated in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced/metastatic cancer. Pending outcome of the ongoing safety evaluation, the company plans to evaluate the efficacy profile of the loading dose regimen in expansion cohorts, followed by maintenance with ADG126 10 mg/kg Q3W in combination with pembrolizumab at sites in the US and Asia Pacific.Clearance received from China’s Center for Drug Evaluation to initiate clinical evaluation of ADG126 in combination with pembrolizumab. This enables the company to broaden its dose expansion cohorts for MSS CRC at selected dosing regimens, and potentially in other tumor types, in its clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck. Additionally, the company recently initiated dosing of a small number of patients with advanced/metastatic cancers at 30 mg/kg ADG126 monotherapy Q3W in China to define the potential maximum tolerated dose of ADG126 monotherapy. Phase 1b/2 data for ADG116, an unmasked anti-CTLA-4 NEObody™ targeting a unique epitope, showed a favorable safety profile and clinical responses, both in monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD-1: ADG116 monotherapy has demonstrated a favorable safety profile at doses up to 15 mg/kg (N=59) and an overall response rate (ORR) of 13% (3/23 evaluable), including confirmed and durable PRs in multiple tumor types.In combination with anti-PD-1 therapy, ADG116 (3 mg/kg Q6W) (N=22) showed a manageable safety profile and an encouraging efficacy profile in dose escalation. Clinical responses from the combination cohorts include a complete response (CR) sustained for nearly two years in a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patient dosed with repeat cycles of ADG116 3 mg/kg (initially every three weeks, then every six weeks) plus toripalimab (ORR = 20%; 1/5 evaluable). An initial PR was also observed in a patient with MSS CRC dosed with repeat cycles of ADG116 3 mg/kg every six weeks plus toripalimab, further demonstrating the potential clinical benefit associated with targeting a unique epitope of CTLA-4 and the essential effects of Treg depletion.ADG116 is clinically active and ready to advance into further clinical development as resources allow. Phase 1 evaluation is ongoing for ADG206, a masked, IgG1 FC-enhanced anti-CD137 POWERbody™ in patients with advanced/metastatic tumors: Adagene has enrolled 10 patients in an ongoing phase 1 trial of ADG206 to evaluate safety, efficacy and tolerability profiles for this next generation anti-CD137 candidate. Dose escalation continues with a cohort ongoing at 3 mg/kg Q3W. No maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has yet been reached.Preclinical data demonstrated that ADG206 was well tolerated and had robust anti-tumor activity as a single agent in multiple tumor models, with 4-fold stronger anti-CD137 agonistic activity of its activated form than a benchmark antibody (urelumab analog) that displayed dose-dependent liver toxicity with an MTD of 0.1 mg/kg Q3W.ADG206 is the company’s first SAFEbody with Fc enhancement, called a POWERbody, to advance into clinic. ADG206 combines SAFEbody precision masking, Fc enhancement and targeting of a unique epitope to solve the safety and efficacy challenges of anti-CD137 therapies, reflecting versatility of Adagene’s dynamic antibody discovery and masking platform. COLLABORATIONS Exelixis: In June 2023, Adagene received a US$3.0 million milestone payment from Exelixis for the successful nomination of lead SAFEbody candidates for the second collaboration program under a technology licensing agreement to develop novel masked antibody-drug conjugate candidates. Sanofi: Adagene and Sanofi are collaborating to develop both bispecific and monoclonal SAFEbody antibody candidates, preparing preclinical candidates using Adagene’s SAFEbody precision masking technology for future development and commercialization by Sanofi. The collaboration announced in March 2022 included an upfront payment of US$17.5 million for the initial two programs, an option fee for two additional programs, potential milestone payments of up to US$2.5 billion, and tiered royalties. Roche: Roche is sponsoring and conducting a phase 1b/2 multi-national trial to evaluate ADG126 in a triple combination with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in first-line hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Adagene retains global development and commercialization rights to ADG126.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents were US$109.9 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to US$143.8 million as of December 31, 2022. Total borrowings from commercial banks in China (denominated in RMB) decreased to US$21.9 million as of December 31, 2023 from US$27.8 million as of December 31, 2022. The associated loan proceeds were primarily used to pay for the company’s R&D activities in China. Net Revenue:Net revenue was US$18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to US$9.3 million in 2022. The increase of approximately 95% reflects net revenue recognized upon fulfillment of certain performance obligations associated with the collaboration and technology licensing agreements with Exelixis and Sanofi, respectively. Net revenue also included a milestone payment of US$3.0 million from Exelixis received in June 2023. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses were US$36.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to US$81.3 million in 2022. The decrease of approximately 55% in R&D expenses reflects clinical focus on and prioritization of the company’s masked, anti-CTLA-4 SAFEbody ADG126. Administrative Expenses:Administrative expenses were US$8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to US$11.9 million in 2022. The decrease was due to both a reduction in personnel and in office-related expenses as a result of cost-control measures. Other Operating Income, Net:Other operating income, net was US$3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Other operating income, net included a one-time compensation payment from a contract manufacturer for a preclinical-related outsourcing arrangement. Net Loss:Net loss attributable to Adagene Inc.’s shareholders was US$18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to US$80.0 million in 2022. Ordinary Shares Outstanding:As of December 31, 2023, there were 55,145,839 ordinary shares issued and outstanding. Each American depository share, or ADS, represents one and one quarter (1.25) ordinary shares of the company. Non-GAAP Net Loss:Non-GAAP net loss, which is defined as net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders for the period after excluding share-based compensation expenses, was US$11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to US$69.5 million in 2022. Please refer to the section in this press release titled “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” for details. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe company uses non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year, which are non-GAAP financial measures, in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. The company believes that non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year help identify underlying trends in the company’s business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain expenses that the company includes in its loss for the year. The company believes that non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year provide useful information about its results of operations, enhances the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allows for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by its management in its financial and operational decision-making. Non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to operating profit, loss for the year or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of its operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year and the reconciliation to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to the company’s data. The company encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year represent net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders for the year excluding share-based compensation expenses. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense arising from the grant of stock-based awards to employees. The company believes that the exclusion of share-based compensation expenses from the net loss in the Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results assists management and investors in making meaningful period-to-period comparisons in the company's operating performance or peer group comparisons because (i) the amount of share-based compensation expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the company’s underlying performance, (ii) such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of the timing of grants of new stock-based awards, and (iii) other companies may use different forms of employee compensation or different valuation methodologies for their share-based compensation. Please see the “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” included in this press release for a full reconciliation of non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per ordinary shares for the year to net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders for the year/period.

The test verified the missile's effectiveness in anti-air warfare, anti-surface warfare, and ballistic missile defense, highlighting its critical role in countering evolving threats. Positive None. Negative None. Defense Technology Analyst The successful test of the enhanced SM-6 missile is a significant development in defense technology, with implications for both national security and the defense industry. The SM-6 Dual II's (Block IA) advanced capabilities, including the ability to intercept sophisticated medium-range ballistic missiles, represent a leap forward in missile defense. This technology enhances the U.S. Navy's layered defense strategy and provides a more versatile response to aerial threats.From a defense contractor's perspective, this successful test is likely to solidify Raytheon's position as a key player in the missile defense sector. The approval of SM-6 sales to allied nations indicates the potential for international market expansion, which could contribute to Raytheon's revenue growth and positively influence its stock performance. The dual-use capability of the missile for anti-air, anti-surface and ballistic missile defense in a single system offers cost efficiency, a factor that can appeal to both domestic and international defense customers facing budget constraints. Military Procurement Specialist The integration of the SM-6 with the Aegis Combat System Baseline 9.C2 variant represents a strategic advancement in military procurement. This integration is not just about adding new hardware; it involves complex software enhancements and system compatibility checks. The successful test indicates a mature product that could streamline the procurement process for the U.S. Navy and allied forces, potentially leading to quicker deployment and operational readiness.Furthermore, the Department of Defense's approval for the sale of SM-6 missiles to allied nations could lead to increased standardization among allies' defense systems. This interoperability is important for joint operations and coalition defense strategies, potentially leading to stronger military alliances and a more robust collective defense posture. International Relations Analyst The approval of SM-6 sales to allied nations is a strategic move that extends beyond pure business implications. It has the potential to strengthen U.S. alliances by providing partners with advanced defensive capabilities, which can contribute to regional stability and deterrence. However, such sales must be carefully managed within the context of international arms control regimes and diplomatic relations, as they can also influence global arms race dynamics and regional power balances.The transfer of advanced military technology like the SM-6 to other countries is often subject to international scrutiny and can impact U.S. foreign policy. It is essential to consider the political implications of these sales, including how they may affect relationships with nations not included in the agreements. Such considerations can impact long-term strategic objectives and require a nuanced approach to maintain a balance between defense industry growth and diplomatic priorities. 03/29/2024 - 03:06 PM Test of enhanced software succeeds against sophisticated medium-range ballistic missile PACIFIC MISSILE RANGE FACILITY, Hawaii, March 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- A Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) built by Raytheon, an RTX (NYSE: RTX) business, intercepted a medium-range ballistic missile target at sea in its final seconds of flight, after being fired from the USS Preble (DDG 88). This test verified some of the missile's enhanced capabilities when launched from a Baseline 9.C2 variant of the Aegis Combat System. The SM-6 missile can perform anti-air warfare, anti-surface warfare and advanced ballistic missile defense at sea. This latest flight test, designated as Flight Test Aegis Weapon System (FTM)-32, involved the SM-6 Dual II (Block IA) configuration with newly qualified software that significantly enhances the missile's capabilities for the U.S. Navy fleet. ""This test demonstrated that the latest versions of the SM-6 and combat system provide the critical capability to destroy an incoming sophisticated missile threat,"" said Kim Ernzen, president of Raytheon Naval Power. ""Raytheon is committed to ensuring our technology stays ahead of evolving threats and is available to sailors as quickly as possible."" FTM-32 was the seventh flight test of the SM-6 against ballistic missile targets and the fourth test utilizing the Dual II (Block IA) configuration. Deployed on U.S. Navy ships, SM-6 delivers a proven over-the-horizon offensive and defensive capability by leveraging the time-tested Standard Missile airframe and propulsion system. It's the only missile that supports anti-air warfare, anti-surface warfare and sea-based terminal ballistic missile defense in one solution, and it's enabling the U.S. and its allies to cost-effectively increase the offensive might of surface forces. The U.S. Department of Defense has approved the sale of SM-6 to several allied nations.

The company expanded its market share, introduced new service offerings, and acquired ICS assets. However, net income from continuing operations increased to $3.0 million, while adjusted EBITDA decreased to $2.6 million due to higher operating expenses. Positive Revenue increased by 9.4% to $42.6 million in 2023. Services revenue grew by 26.6% in Q4 of 2023. The company acquired certain assets of Innovative Cinema Solutions Net income from continuing operations increased to $3.0 million. Gross profit increased to $10.6 million or 24.8% of revenues in 2023. Negative Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $2.6 million in 2023. Income from operations decreased to $0.6 million in 2023. The company experienced a decrease in total revenue for the fourth quarter despite growth in services and projection screens. Market Research Analyst The growth in revenue by 9.4% for Strong Global Entertainment indicates a positive market response to their strategic initiatives, particularly in the laser projection and services sectors. The expansion into Europe and the acquisition of ICS assets are strategic moves that could potentially open up new revenue streams and consolidate the company's market position. However, the decrease in revenue for the fourth quarter, alongside the decision to exit the content business, suggests a re-alignment of the company's focus towards its core competencies. It's important to observe how this focus shift will affect the company's long-term revenue diversification.The mixed results in operational income and net income versus the decrease in EBITDA highlight a concerning increase in administrative expenses. Investors should closely monitor how these expenses are managed moving forward, as they have the potential to erode profit margins despite top-line growth. The emphasis on driving cash flow from core entertainment products and services lines is an indication of the company's commitment to improving operational efficiency. Financial Analyst Strong Global Entertainment's improved gross margins reflect effective cost management in the production and delivery of their services and products. The increase in net income from continuing operations, despite a decline in income from operations, could be indicative of non-operational income streams or one-time benefits, which should be scrutinized for sustainability. Investors would benefit from understanding the nature of these income streams to assess the company's financial health accurately.The decline in Adjusted EBITDA, despite increased profitability from products and services, is a red flag that needs to be addressed. It may signal underlying inefficiencies or growing pains associated with scaling operations, such as the integration of ICS. The company's ability to streamline operations and control costs as it scales will be important for maintaining investor confidence and ensuring long-term value creation. Industry Analyst The entertainment technology sector is highly competitive and Strong Global Entertainment's focus on laser projection upgrades and expanded service offerings suggests an alignment with industry trends towards high-quality visual experiences. The company's strategic exit from the content business could be seen as a move to concentrate on technological advancements in cinema experiences, which may be more in line with their core strengths and market demand.However, the timing of immersive screen projects and the European expansion will require careful execution to avoid overextension. The company's first Seismos immersive flooring project represents an innovative step in the sector, potentially setting a new standard for immersive experiences. The success of these initiatives will hinge on the company's ability to deliver consistent and high-quality service while managing the costs associated with such cutting-edge technologies. 03/29/2024 - 04:30 PM Charlotte, N.C., March 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Strong Global Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE American: SGE) (the “Company” or “Strong Global Entertainment”) today announced operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.

Upgrades to laser projection continue to drive customer demand.Services revenue grew 26.6% during the fourth quarter of 2023, and 34.0% for the full year, with increased market share, new service offerings, and contribution from the Innovative Cinema Solutions (“ICS”) acquisition adding to revenues in late 2023.Screen systems revenue increased 5.3% during the fourth quarter of 2023, and grew 7.2% for the full year, largely related to marketplace momentum around laser screen replacements and expansion into Europe. This growth was partially offset by the timing of immersive screen projects.

Mark Roberson, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We delivered solid results for full year 2023, achieving revenue growth and improved gross margins as demand for laser projection and customer upgrade initiatives increased as the year progressed. The Company also completed the acquisition of ICS assets in the fourth quarter, increasing the scale and scope of our services business. As part of our annual planning process, we evaluated the performance of all our lines of business and initiated a plan to exit the content business, as we strategically focus the Company’s resources on driving cash flow from our core entertainment products and services lines.” Select Financial Highlights ●Revenue increased 9.4% to $42.6 million in 2023 from $39.0 million in 2022 due to increased sales of projection screens and equipment, as well as increased demand for installation and maintenance services. For the fourth quarter, total revenue decreased despite growth in both services and projection screens due to the timing of a large distribution sale in the prior year. The increase in demand from cinema customers was due to a combination of increased sales efforts, expanded market share and a rebound in the rate of investment by exhibitors for the upgrade of their auditoriums, particularly related to the pace of laser projection upgrades. Strong Global Entertainment expects the upgrade activity to be a multi-year catalyst in the industry. ●Gross profit increased to $10.6 million or 24.8% of revenues in 2023 compared to $9.5 million or 24.3% in 2022. The increase resulted primarily from increased demand for large format projection cinema screens and installation and maintenance services. ●Income from operations was $0.6 million in 2023 compared to $2.4 million during 2022. As increased gross profit was offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses, including costs of operating as a stand-alone public company. ●Net income from continuing operations was $3.0 million as compared to $2.3 million in 2023. ●Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $2.6 million as compared to $3.2 million in the prior year, as increased profitability from products and services from continuing operations was offset by the increased general and administrative costs primarily related to expenses associated with operating as a stand-alone public company.

The FG® logo and Fundamental Global® are registered trademarks of Fundamental Global LLC. Use of Non-GAAP Measures Strong Global Entertainment, Inc. prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). In addition to disclosing financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company discloses information regarding Adjusted EBITDA (“Adjusted EBITDA”), which differs from the commonly used EBITDA (“EBITDA”). Adjusted EBITDA both adjusts net income (loss) to exclude income taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization, and excludes share-based compensation, impairment charges, severance, foreign currency transaction gains (losses), transactional gains and expenses, gains on insurance recoveries, and other cash and non-cash charges and gains. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of performance defined in accordance with GAAP. However, Adjusted results EBITDA is used internally in planning and evaluating the Company’s operating performance. Accordingly, management believes that disclosure of these metrics offers investors, bankers and other stakeholders an additional view of the Company’s operations that, when coupled with the GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of the Company’s financial. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or to net cash from operating activities as measures of operating results or liquidity. The Company’s calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, and the measures exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating the Company’s performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (i) they do not reflect the Company’s cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, (ii) they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company’s working capital needs, (iii) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on the Company’s debt, (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements, (v) they do not adjust for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in the Company’s statements of cash flows, (vi) they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters management considers not to be indicative of the Company’s ongoing operations, and (vii) other companies in the Company’s industry may calculate these measures differently than the Company does, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Management believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). The Company also presents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because (i) management believes these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the Company’s industry, (ii) management believes investors will find these measures useful in assessing the Company’s ability to service or incur indebtedness, and (iii) management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA internally as benchmarks to evaluate the Company’s operating performance or compare the Company’s performance to that of its competitors.

Despite a decline in sales, the company reported increased profitability, cash flow, and EBITDA in the fourth quarter. The company's strategic focus on reducing inventories and debt, along with maintaining price discipline, contributed to its financial performance. Escalade's management highlighted efforts to strengthen the balance sheet, improve margins, and prioritize debt reduction for the future. Positive Improved gross margin and cash generation in the fourth quarter Reduction in net leverage and debt Focus on working capital discipline and inventory reduction Significant increase in cash flow from operations Efforts to strengthen balance sheet and prioritize debt reduction Strategic focus on reducing inventories and debt Maintained price discipline and improved sales mix Opportunities for value creation and product innovation Expectation of lower interest expense and improved financial position Negative Decline in net sales for both fourth quarter and full year 2023 Decrease in operating income and EBITDA for full year 2023 Net income decline compared to 2022 Reduction in gross margin for full year 2023 Lower cash flow from operations for full year 2023 Financial Analyst Escalade, Inc.'s financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 demonstrate a mixed financial performance, with notable strengths in operational efficiency and a disciplined approach to cost management. The decline in net sales by 9.2% and 16.0% for the quarter and full year respectively, indicates a challenging market environment, potentially reflective of broader economic trends affecting consumer discretionary spending. However, the improvement in gross margin by 192 basis points in the fourth quarter suggests effective cost containment strategies and a successful shift towards a more profitable sales mix.The significant increase in cash flow from operations, up 43.9% from the previous year, highlights strong internal cash generation capabilities. This is a positive sign for investors as it suggests the company is not only managing its expenses well but is also improving its working capital management. The reduction of debt by $21.1 million in the fourth quarter, resulting in a lower net debt to EBITDA ratio, is indicative of a robust balance sheet and a prudent approach to leverage. This could potentially increase the company's financial flexibility and resilience against market volatility.While the overall decrease in operating income and EBITDA for the full year is a concern, the management's focus on inventory reduction and operational improvements may set a foundation for margin expansion in the future. The strategic exit from Mexico, despite incurring shutdown costs, could be seen as a realignment of resources towards more profitable ventures. For investors, these actions may signal a company positioning itself for long-term stability and profitability, despite short-term headwinds. Market Research Analyst Escalade's performance in the sporting goods and recreational equipment sector reflects broader consumer trends, where discretionary spending has been impacted by economic factors. The company's ability to improve demand in specific product categories like basketball and indoor games could indicate a strategic alignment with evolving consumer preferences. However, the overall decline in net sales raises questions about the company's market share and competitive positioning.The emphasis on working capital discipline and inventory management is a notable strategic move. By reducing inventories, Escalade is likely aiming to match supply with demand more closely, potentially reducing the risk of overstocking and the need for discounting, which can erode margins. This approach could be particularly advantageous in a sector where product life cycles are short and consumer tastes change rapidly.The strategic focus on direct-to-consumer channels and product innovation is critical for growth within the industry. Escalade's efforts to enhance its online presence and develop new products could capture increased market share and mitigate the impact of softer consumer demand across traditional retail channels. Investors should monitor the effectiveness of these strategies in driving revenue growth and maintaining customer engagement in the long term. Debt Market Analyst The reduction of Escalade's net debt to EBITDA ratio from 2.8x to 2.2x is a significant improvement, signaling a stronger credit profile. For bondholders and potential lenders, this is a reassuring development as it suggests a lower risk of default. The company's proactive debt management, coupled with its ability to generate robust cash flows, may lead to more favorable borrowing terms in the future, including lower interest rates and access to a broader range of financing options.Escalade's senior secured revolving credit facility with $66.8 million of availability provides liquidity that could be used for strategic initiatives or to weather potential downturns. The company's commitment to further debt reduction in 2024 could enhance its financial stability and investor confidence. However, the balance between debt reduction and necessary investments in brand and product portfolio will be important for sustaining growth and competitiveness in the market.Investors should also consider the potential impact of the company's exit from Mexico on its debt profile. While the move is likely to result in one-time costs, the long-term effect on the company's financial leverage could be positive if it leads to a more streamlined and efficient operation. 03/29/2024 - 04:00 PM EVANSVILLE, Ind., March 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Escalade, Inc. (NASDAQ: ESCA, or the ""Company""), a leading manufacturer and distributor of sporting goods and indoor/outdoor recreational equipment, today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. FOURTH QUARTER 2023 RESULTS(As compared to the fourth quarter 2022) Net sales decreased 9.2% to $65.5 millionGross margin improved 192 basis points, to 24.3%Operating income increased 1.6% to $5.0 millionEBITDA totaled $6.4 million, an increase of 11.1%Net income of $2.9 million, or $0.21 per diluted share vs. $2.7 million, or $0.20 per diluted share for 2022Cash provided by operations of $20.6 million vs $14.3 million in 2022FULL YEAR 2023 RESULTS(As compared to full year 2022) Net sales decreased 16.0% to $263.6 millionGross margin declined 3 basis points, to 23.4%Operating income decreased 32.3% to $17.8 millionEBITDA totaled $23.5 million, a decrease of 27.6%Net income of $9.8 million, or $0.71 per diluted share vs. $18.0 million, or $1.31 per diluted share for 2022Cash provided by operations of $48.3 million vs. $8.6 million in 2022For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023, Escalade reported net income of $2.9 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, versus net income of $2.7 million, or $0.20 per diluted share for the fourth quarter in 2022. Total net sales declined 9.2% on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, primarily due to softer consumer demand across the majority of the Company's product categories, partially offset by improved demand in our basketball and indoor games product categories. Escalade reported fourth quarter gross margin of 24.3%, an increase of 192 basis points versus the prior-year quarter, driven by a combination of continued price discipline, a more favorable sales mix and a decline in freight and storage costs, when compared to the prior-year period. The Company generated $20.6 million of cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter 2023, compared to $14.3 million generated in the prior-year period. The year-over-year increase in cash flow from operations was supported by higher profitability, together with improved net working capital efficiency resulting from a focused inventory reduction initiative. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (""EBITDA"") increased 11.1% to $6.4 million in the fourth quarter 2023, versus $5.8 million in the prior-year period. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $66.8 million of availability on its senior secured revolving credit facility maturing in 2027. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company utilized its strong cash flow from operations to reduce its debt by $21.1 million, resulting in a ratio of net debt to trailing twelve month EBITDA of 2.2x at December 31, 2023, down from 2.8x at the end of 2022. Escalade's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock. The dividend is payable on April 22, 2024 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on April 15, 2024. Effective January 1, 2023, Escalade transitioned to a conventional twelve-month reporting calendar. Please see the accompanying table in our footnotes for a comparison of the days in each quarter for 2022 and 2023. MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY ""We delivered a strong finish to the year, highlighted by improved gross margin, robust cash generation, and a significant reduction in net leverage,"" stated Walter P. Glazer, Jr., President and CEO of Escalade. ""During a period of softer consumer demand driven by changes in discretionary spending, we successfully maintained our price discipline on in-line product while clearing excess inventory acquired during the Covid era supply chain disruptions, reduced both fixed and variable costs, and continued to drive a more favorable sales mix, culminating in fourth quarter growth in earnings per share and cash flow despite lower sales."" ""Our strategic focus on working capital discipline continues to prioritize a reduction in our inventories,"" continued Glazer. ""During the fourth quarter, we reduced total inventories by nearly $13 million, resulting in improved working capital efficiency. The efforts of our team were aided by an improving wholesale inventory environment coupled with stabilizing consumer demand, particularly in our basketball and indoor games categories."" ""Improved profitability and cash conversion contributed to significant year-over-year growth in fourth quarter cash flow from operations, which allowed us to reduce our debt and further strengthen our balance sheet,"" continued Glazer. ""We generated more than $20 million of operating cash flow in the fourth quarter, an increase of 43.9% versus the prior-year period. In 2023, we reduced our outstanding indebtedness by $44 million, including $20 million in the fourth quarter alone, bringing our ratio of net debt to trailing twelve-month EBITDA to 2.2x at year-end 2023. Looking ahead to 2024, we will continue to prioritize further debt reduction, while continuing to invest in our industry-leading brands and product portfolio."" ""Our fourth quarter gross margin benefited from a favorable sales mix and freight cost reductions,"" continued Glazer. ""While gross margin increased more than 190 basis points year-over-year to 24.3% in the fourth quarter, gross margin declined on a sequential basis versus the third quarter of 2023, partially as a result of our focus on inventory reduction. Given lower inventory costs, reduced freight and storage expenses, operational improvements, and continued price discipline, we see a pathway to improve margins as we move through 2024."" ""Our exit from Mexico is proceeding as planned,"" stated Glazer. ""We wound down most operations in the fourth quarter, incurring severance and other shut-down costs during the period."" ""We remain optimistic regarding opportunities for value creation in the year ahead,"" stated Glazer. ""While consumer demand remains relatively soft across most of our categories so far this year, we continue to see encouraging signs of growth within our direct-to-consumer channel as well as opportunities for product innovation across our portfolio. Inventory levels at retail are lower in most categories following prudent inventory management during the holiday season by our retail partners. Finally, we expect to benefit from lower interest expense as a result of successfully reducing our debt levels and an improved mix of lower cost fixed rate debt. Looking ahead, we believe that our strong, diverse portfolio of recreational brands positions us to successfully navigate the current macroeconomic environment.""

They highlight the importance of using technology to shape future environments, reach ESG targets, and make buildings more intelligent and sustainable. Positive None. Negative None. Sustainability Analyst Examining the intersection of technology and ESG within the commercial property sector reveals a rapidly evolving landscape. The adoption of sophisticated Building Management Systems (BMS) allows for a more granular and dynamic approach to energy management, which could significantly reduce the carbon footprint of buildings. The scalability of such technology means that a single operator could potentially optimize hundreds of buildings simultaneously, leveraging data analytics to pinpoint inefficiencies and rectify them in real-time.However, the benefits extend beyond mere energy savings. Intelligent buildings can contribute to the social and governance pillars of ESG by enhancing tenant comfort and safety, thus potentially increasing the property's value and attractiveness to investors. In the long term, this tech-driven approach to ESG could become a market differentiator, setting a new standard for the industry.The challenge lies in the upfront investment and the need for skilled personnel to manage these systems effectively. As the technology becomes more prevalent, the industry may face a skills gap that needs to be addressed through education and training programs. Real Estate Investment Analyst The integration of ESG-focused technology in real estate is not just a trend but a strategic investment that could reshape the industry's financial landscape. Investors are increasingly scrutinizing the ESG performance of their portfolios and properties that excel in these criteria are likely to see enhanced marketability and potentially higher returns. The ability to monitor and improve a building's ESG performance at scale could translate into significant operational cost savings, leading to an improved net operating income (NOI) for property owners.It is important to note that while the potential for increased valuation is there, the initial capital expenditure for such technologies might be substantial. Investors and stakeholders must weigh the long-term benefits against short-term financial impacts. Additionally, as regulatory pressures mount for greener buildings, properties equipped with advanced ESG technologies may also benefit from incentives or avoid potential penalties, influencing both their competitive and risk profiles. 03/29/2024 - 10:15 AM With technology's increasing footprint within our built environment today and in the future, CBRE's Su-Fern Tan and Taronga Ventures' Julian Kezelman explore its true potential in the ESG space.NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 29, 2024 / CBRE Group, Inc.CBRETechnology forms the fabric of everything humans interact with, including their built environment.At the Property Council of Australia's first Technology Summit in Sydney, CBRE's Phil Rowland underscored the importance of harnessing the potential of technology to shape the diversity of our future surroundings.""It's important that we make our industry more productive, our places and precincts more relevant and inclusive to our tenants and the public.

Market Research Analyst The preliminary data from Vincerx Pharma's ongoing clinical trials for VIP236 and VIP943, alongside the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023, are significant for investors and stakeholders. The progress in clinical trials can affect the company's valuation as it may signal the potential for future revenue streams if the drugs are successful. Moreover, the expected cash runway into Q3 2024 provides insight into the company's financial health and its ability to sustain operations and research without the immediate need for additional financing.From a market perspective, the advancements in the VersAptx platform and the preclinical data could position Vincerx as an innovative player in the oncology space. The reported decrease in R&D and G&A expenses reflects a more streamlined operation which could be seen as a positive move towards achieving profitability. However, the net loss figures indicate ongoing challenges in reaching financial stability. The balance between innovation potential and current financial health is a delicate one that investors need to monitor closely. Oncology Doctor The introduction of VIP236 and VIP943, both leveraging the VersAptx platform, represents a promising development in cancer therapeutics. VIP236's design aims to mitigate chemotherapy-related side effects, which could improve patient quality of life and adherence to treatment protocols. VIP943's preliminary pharmacokinetic data suggest a favorable safety profile, which is encouraging for its potential use in treating hematologic malignancies.As an oncologist, the efficacy of these drugs in early trials is as important as their safety profile. The partial responses observed in the enitociclib trials, particularly at lower doses, suggest a strong potential for this drug in combination therapies. These developments could lead to more targeted and effective treatment options for patients with various forms of cancer, which is always the ultimate goal in oncology. Financial Analyst Reviewing the financial results, Vincerx's significant reduction in R&D and G&A expenses indicates a strategic realignment, potentially improving the company's cost structure. However, the sharp decrease in cash reserves from $52.5 million to $12.8 million raises concerns about the sustainability of operations beyond early Q3 2024 without additional funding or revenue generation. The reported net losses underscore the importance of the clinical trials' outcomes.Investors should weigh the potential of the company's pipeline against its burn rate and consider the implications of the funding gap that may arise after Q3 2024. The company's ability to either secure additional financing or advance its pipeline to a stage that could attract partnership or acquisition interest will be critical to its continued viability. 03/29/2024 - 03:20 PM VIP236, first-in-class small molecule-drug conjugate (SMDC), preliminary Phase 1 data and update on pipeline progress will be presented by management at a virtual investor event on April 8 at 2:00 PM PT Phase 1 trial ongoing for VIP943, a best-in-class anti-CD123 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC); preliminary data anticipated on or around the 2024 European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Meeting; in addition, pharmacokinetic data will be shared at the 2024 American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting Expected cash runway into early Q3 2024 PALO ALTO, Calif., March 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vincerx Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: VINC), a biopharmaceutical company aspiring to address the unmet medical needs of patients with cancer through paradigm-shifting therapeutics, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a corporate update. “The last calendar year was pivotal for Vincerx,” said Ahmed Hamdy, M.D., Chief Executive Officer. “Having progressed three clinical programs, including VIP236 and VIP943, both developed with our VersAptxTM platform, and enitociclib, we firmly established ourselves as a clinical-stage cancer therapeutics company with novel product candidates that aim to improve safety and efficacy over traditional chemotherapy.” Raquel Izumi, Ph.D., Chief Operations Officer, added, “VIP236, our first-in-class SMDC, is in a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial for advanced and metastatic solid tumors. To date, we have dosed 20 patients across two dosing schedules and results from the once every 3-week dosing schedule continue to show a strong safety profile with dose-dependent clinical activity. We are excited to share more details regarding the preliminary Phase 1 data during the 2024 AACR Annual Meeting.” Dr. Izumi continued, “VIP943, our best-in-class anti-CD123 ADC, is in a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial in hematologic malignancies. Enrollment in the third cohort is underway with a total of 9 patients dosed. Preliminary pharmacokinetic data from the first two cohorts show very little payload in circulation, which aligns with the favorable safety profile observed in nonhuman primates in our preclinical studies. We look forward to sharing pharmacokinetic data for VIP943 during AACR and more details regarding the preliminary Phase 1 data on or around EHA. Enitociclib, our highly selective CDK9 inhibitor, in a Phase 1 dose-escalation study with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has signaled encouraging efficacy in Phase 1 combination studies in peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and double-hit B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Earlier this year, we reported partial responses at doses below expected efficacy levels, highlighting the drugs synergistic potential with other treatments.” Dr. Hamdy concluded, “We entered 2024 with strong momentum and remain focused on aggressively advancing our programs and maximizing the value of our next-generation VersAptx platform.” FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2023 CLINICAL PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS VersAptx™ Platform VersAptx is Vincerx’s versatile and adaptable, next-generation bioconjugation platform. The modular nature of this platform enables the combination of different targeting, linker, and payload technologies to develop bespoke bioconjugates to address different cancer biologies.Recent preclinical data demonstrated the ability of our legumain linker + KSPi payload with CellTrapper effector chemistry to enhance the potency of TRODELVY® and ENHERTU®, two marketed ADCs, by conjugating TRODELVY's TROP2 and ENHERTU's HER2 antibodies with our effector chemistry. The results of this study demonstrated a significant improvement in the potency of both drugs, with TRODELVY potency amplified by a factor of 20 and ENHERTU potency by a factor of 8.Vincerx published a manuscript in Frontiers in Pharmacology titled, “Neutrophil elastase as a versatile cleavage enzyme for activation of αvβ3 integrin-targeted small molecule drug conjugates with different payload classes in the tumor microenvironment.”Vincerx presented a preclinical poster at the 2023 AACR Annual Meeting demonstrating the promise of VIP924, a first-in-class CXCR5-targeted ADC from the VersAptx platform. VIP236 VIP236 is a αVβ3 SMDC conjugated to an optimized camptothecin (CPT) from the VersAptx platform. VIP236 is a first-in-class product candidate designed to deliver its optimized CPT payload directly to tumor tissues to overcome the chemotherapy-related side effects and transporter liabilities of this well-established class of anticancer drugs. Preclinical studies have shown 11 times more optimized CPT is delivered to the cancerous tissues than found circulating in the blood. Additionally, the active component of VIP236 is designed to bypass cancer resistance mechanisms.The favorable characteristics of VIP236, including improved linker attachment, stable solubility, and tumor-specific payload release, were featured in a peer-reviewed publication titled, “Unleashing the Potential of Camptothecin: Exploring Innovative Strategies for Structural Modification and Therapeutic Advancements,” by Zheng Chen in the March 14, 2024 issue of Journal of Medicinal Chemistry.To date, the VIP236 Phase 1 dose-escalation trial (NTC05371054) has enrolled 20 patients with advanced or metastatic cancer unresponsive to standard therapies.Vincerx will present more details around the preliminary Phase 1 data at the upcoming 2024 AACR Annual Meeting, accompanied by a virtual investor event to review the data and provide a pipeline update on April 8 at 2:00 PM PT. The event can be accessed through the Investors Page on the Vincerx website. VIP943 VIP943 is a novel CD123-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) from the VersAptx platform.In August 2023, Vincerx received IND clearance for a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial of VIP943 in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) (NCT06034275).In September 2023, Vincerx announced the dosing of its first patient in that study.Enrollment in the third cohort is underway, with a total of 9 patients dosed. Preliminary pharmacokinetic results continue to show very little payload circulating in the blood, validating the favorable safety profile observed in nonhuman primates in preclinical studies.Vincerx will present more details regarding the preliminary Phase 1 data for VIP943 on or around the 2024 EHA Annual Meeting. Enitociclib Enitociclib is a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor designed to block the activation of RNA polymerase II, leading to the reduction of oncogenes MYC and MCL1.In 2023, Vincerx presented preclinical data supporting the continued advancement of enitociclib at multiple medical congresses. Vincerx also published a manuscript titled, “Enitociclib, a Selective CDK9 Inhibitor, Induces Complete Regression of MYC+ Lymphoma by Downregulation of RNA Polymerase II Mediated Transcription” in Cancer Research Communications, an AACR journal.Enitociclib is currently in a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial (NTC05371054) evaluating the combination of enitociclib, venetoclax, and prednisone in DLBCL and PTCL. This trial is being conducted in collaboration with the NIH.Earlier this year, Vincerx announced that 2 out of 3 patients with PTCL had a partial response (PR). The first patient saw a 91% reduction in their tumor burden, while the second patient saw an 86% reduction in pulmonary lesions and resolution of skin lesions. In addition, 1 out of 2 patients with DH-DLBCL had a PR after one cycle of treatment, seeing an 80% reduction in tumor burden. These responses occurred at doses below expected efficacy levels. VIP924 VIP924 is a first-in-class CXCR5-targeted ADC from the VersAptx platform.Vincerx presented preclinical data at the 2023 AACR Annual Meeting demonstrating significant activity in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) lymphoma mouse models.Vincerx shared preclinical data at the 2023 ASH Annual Meeting showing superior activity and safety compared with commercially available B-cell targeted ADCs.IND application anticipated in late 2025 or early 2026, pending funding. FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS Vincerx had $12.8 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023, as compared to $52.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2022. Based on its current business plans and assumptions, Vincerx believes its available capital will be sufficient to meet its operating requirements into early third quarter of 2024.Research and development (R&D) expenses for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 were $3.7 million and $29.0 million, respectively, as compared to $11.5 million and $49.8 million, respectively, for each of the same periods in 2022. The year over year decrease of approximately $20.9 million is primarily the result of decreases in third party service and supplier expenses, including manufacturing services associated with our ADC program of approximately $9.7 million and clinical services of approximately $2.6 million, as well as decreases in expenses related to headcount, including declines in stock-based compensation expense of approximately $3.3 million and employee salaries of approximately $3.1 million as a result of our headcount reduction in June 2022.General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 were $1.8 million and $13.6 million, respectively, as compared to $4.0 million and $18.9 million for the same periods in 2022. The year over year decrease of approximately $5.2 million was primarily driven by decreases in stock-based compensation expense of $2.8 million, professional services of $1.4 million, and a decrease in expenses related to headcount of $0.7 million.For the fourth quarter and full year 2023, Vincerx reported a net loss of $4.9 million, or $0.23 per share, and a net loss of $40.2 million, or $1.89 per share, respectively. For the fourth quarter and full year 2022, Vincerx reported a net loss of $13.8 million, or $0.65 per share, and a net loss of $63.0 million, or $3.00 per share, respectively.

Positive GigaMedia reported a revenue decrease of 23.2% in 2023, reaching $4.3 million. The company's gross profit for 2023 was $2.4 million, with an operating loss of $3.2 million and a net loss of $3.5 million. Operating expenditures were reduced by approximately 10.7% in 2023.

The company recorded a $2.2 million valuation loss on investments. GigaMedia's full-year operating loss slightly increased to $3.2 million in 2023. Market Research Analyst The reported financial results from GigaMedia Limited indicate a significant revenue decline of 23.2%, which is a red flag for investors and stakeholders. This decline is attributed to the termination of a non-performing game and scaling back of related workforce and overheads. While the reduction in operating expenditures by 10.7% shows management's commitment to cost control, it may not be sufficient to offset the revenue losses in the short term. The reported net loss of $3.5 million, although narrower before investment valuation adjustments, suggests that the company's core operations might be underperforming. The slight decrease in cash reserves also points to a need for careful financial management going forward.From a market perspective, the company's pivot towards developing AI-powered tools for content renovation in casual games could be a strategic move to differentiate its offerings. However, the success of such tools as a commercialized solution remains speculative. Investors should monitor the company's ability to leverage these tools to drive future growth and whether this can translate into improved financial performance. Financial Analyst Analyzing GigaMedia's balance sheet strength, the company maintains a solid financial position with a cash reserve of $38.8 million, which is reassuring for debt management and operational flexibility. However, the net asset value of $3.87 per share should be weighed against the net loss per share of $0.31 to gauge the true value offered to shareholders. The company's decision to not take on any bank loans is a conservative approach that avoids interest expenses, but this strategy might limit potential for aggressive expansion or investment in new revenue streams.Investors should also consider the impact of the $2.2 million valuation loss on investments. This non-operational loss can be seen as a one-time event, but it also raises questions about the company's investment strategies and risk management practices. The long-term implications of these investment losses on the company's growth and profitability should be carefully scrutinized. 03/29/2024 - 09:00 AM TAIPEI, March 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- GigaMedia Limited (NASDAQ: GIGM) today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Highlights For 2023, GigaMedia reported revenues of $4.3 million, with a gross profit of $2.4 million, an operating loss of $3.2 million and the net loss of $3.5 million. The revenues decreased by 23.2% in 2023. During 2023, we terminated a non-performing game while streamlined others, and correspondingly scaled back related workforce, costs and overhead. As a result, we managed to slash operating expenditures down by approximately 10.7%. All in all, the net loss before including investment valuation adjustment was narrowed to $1.3 million, less than half of that in 2022. However, pursuant to requirements of the accounting standards, we recorded a $2.2 million valuation loss on our investments, and the net loss became $3.5 million, $0.7 million higher than 2022. On the balance sheet side, we maintained a solid financial position with a small cash burn rate in 2023, and our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash amounted to $38.8 million at the end of 2023, slightly decreased from $39.1 million at the end of 2022. In 2024, we will be devoted in developing AI-powered tools to enhance efficiency on renovating contents in our casual games. Besides in-house application, we will also explore potentials for the tools to become a commercialized solution of platform for publishing AI-assisted creation of products. We believe achieving sophistication in AI is very crucial in boosting our productivity and accelerate the growth of our business. Fourth Quarter and Full Year Overview Consolidated 4Q revenues decreased by 18.8% quarter-on-quarter mainly due to seasonality, and by 21.1% year-over-year due to certain licensed games declined.

Given potential changes in economic conditions and consumer spending, the evolving nature of digital entertainments, and various other risk factors, including those discussed in the Company's 2022 Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as referenced below, actual results may differ materially. Since late 2023, we have being taking measures to re-examine mechanisms in our legacy casual games and to reconstruct players' ecosystem. While the effect would take some time to exhibit, we believe that will lead to a healthier gross margin in the long-run for our own offerings. Meanwhile, our business strategies always include expanding through mergers and acquisitions. ""We will continue reviewing strategic opportunities that would enable us to accelerate our growth and enhance shareholders' value,"" stated CEO James Huang. Use of Non-GAAP Measures To supplement GigaMedia's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company uses the following measure defined as non-GAAP by the SEC: EBITDA. Management believes that EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is a useful supplemental measure of performance because it excludes certain non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization and that EBITDA is a measure of performance used by some investors, equity analysts and others to make informed investment decisions. EBITDA is not a recognized earnings measure under GAAP and does not have a standardized meaning. Non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A limitation of using EBITDA is that it does not include all items that impact the Company's net income for the period. Reconciliations to the GAAP equivalents of the non-GAAP financial measures are provided on the attached unaudited financial statements.

Negative None. 03/29/2024 - 11:00 AM OAKLAND, Calif., March 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- American Bureau of Shipping, CALAMCO, Fleet Management Limited, Sumitomo Corporation and TOTE Services, LLC (""TOTE Services"") today announced the execution of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to jointly conduct a feasibility study (hereinafter ""Study"") with the aim to be one of the pioneers in establishing a comprehensive and competitive supply chain for the provision of clean ammonia ship-to-ship bunkering in the US West Coast. This Study will be conducted at the Port of Oakland, Benicia and nearby major ports in U.S. West Coast. Ammonia, which does not emit any CO2 when combusted, has long been considered one of the most promising alternative marine fuels to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) direct emissions within the shipping industry which aligns with the revised International Maritime Organization (IMO) strategy to reach net-zero emissions from international shipping ""close to"" 2050 on a life-cycle basis. CALAMCO is a California based cooperative composed of grower members, as well as the largest ammonia distributer in California. The Study aims to explore possibility to utilize CALAMCO's existing ammonia storage terminal at port of Stockton for a pilot demonstration project of ammonia bunkering for car carriers calling at port of Benicia and container vessels calling at port of Oakland as first step toward wide adoption of ammonia as marine fuel in the US West Coast. Port of Benicia is one of the key vehicle-handing ports in U.S. West Coast, while Port of Oakland also rank among top 10 of US largest container ports.

CALAMCO has many years of safe and efficient operational experience at the Port of Stockton."" Kishore Rajvanshy, Managing Director at Fleet Management Limited, said, ""We are pleased to lend our technical expertise to this important clean ammonia study, which ultimately aims to facilitate carbon-free trade between the Far East and the US West Coast. Our focus on designing dual fuel vessels and implementing safe and reliable ammonia bunkering has positioned us well in recent years. We have also collaborated closely with our ship-owning clients, providing support in the development of ammonia bunkering vessels, as well as ammonia-fuelled container vessels and bulk carriers. As one of the world's largest ship managers, we are committed to supporting our clients' green energy transition and contributing to the broader decarbonisation efforts within the shipping industry.""

The launch aims to provide efficient payment solutions to Private & Commercial banking clients, enabling direct payments to Dime Business Checking accounts within minutes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The introduction of Zelle for Business by Dime Community Bancshares represents a strategic move to enhance their digital banking services. This service allows for real-time payments, which is a growing demand among businesses for efficiency and improved cash flow management. By adopting this technology, Dime is likely aiming to attract and retain business clients who value quick and seamless transactions.From a financial perspective, this could lead to increased transaction volumes and higher customer engagement, potentially boosting fee-based revenue. However, it's essential to monitor how this service will affect the bank's operational costs and whether it will require additional investments in security and fraud prevention measures. The impact on Dime's stock performance will largely depend on the adoption rate of Zelle for Business among its customers and the competitive response from other financial institutions. Market Research Analyst The launch of Zelle for Business by Dime Community Bancshares taps into the trend of digital transformation within the banking sector. With businesses increasingly seeking digital solutions, this move could position Dime favorably within the market. It's important to evaluate customer reception, as the value proposition hinges on convenience and speed.Market differentiation could be a significant factor. If Dime's implementation of Zelle for Business offers unique features or superior user experience compared to competitors, it could capture a larger market share. Conversely, if the service is undifferentiated, the impact on Dime's market positioning might be minimal. Understanding the competitive landscape and customer preferences will be key in assessing the strategic value of this launch. Cybersecurity Expert With the rollout of Zelle for Business, cybersecurity becomes a paramount concern for Dime Community Bancshares. Real-time payment systems are attractive targets for cybercriminals due to the speed and irreversibility of transactions. The bank must ensure robust security protocols to protect against unauthorized transactions and data breaches.The reputation and trust of Dime's customers hinge on the bank's ability to safeguard their assets. Any security incident related to Zelle for Business could have significant reputational and financial implications. It's critical for stakeholders to understand the measures Dime is taking to secure this new service and how these measures compare with industry standards.

Positive Positive end-of-Phase 2 meeting with FDA regarding pivotal Phase 3 trials for episodic and chronic migraine treatment. Expected announcement of interim analysis results for chronic migraine study in Q2 2024 and full study results in Q3 2024. Private placement agreements for $15 million in senior secured convertible notes with Daewoong Pharmaceutical Co., Completion of enrollment for Phase 2 study of ABP-450 for chronic migraine treatment with plans for interim analysis in Q2 2024. Sufficient funding for late-stage clinical development and corporate operations through June 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent announcement by AEON Biopharma regarding the alignment with FDA on Phase 3 trial designs for ABP-450 is a significant milestone in the company's clinical development pathway. The ability to progress to Phase 3 trials often serves as a positive signal to investors about the potential of a drug candidate. In this case, the focus on both episodic and chronic migraine, which are prevalent conditions with substantial market demand, suggests a large target market for AEON's product.The announcement of topline data from the interim analysis of the ongoing Phase 2 study expected in Q2 2024, followed by full study data in Q3 2024, provides a clear timeline for investors to monitor AEON's progress. Additionally, the $15 million in private placement agreements indicates a vote of confidence from strategic partners and provides necessary capital to fund the late-stage clinical development. Investors should be aware that the company's financial runway is projected to last through June 2024, which aligns with the expected data release, potentially reducing financial risk in the short term.However, it is important to note that the biopharmaceutical sector is highly volatile, with significant risks associated with clinical trials. The success of Phase 3 trials is not guaranteed and any setbacks could have a material impact on the company's financial health and stock price. Medical Research Analyst The strategic importance of AEON Biopharma's ABP-450 for the prevention of chronic and episodic migraine cannot be understated. Migraine is a common and debilitating condition, affecting a significant portion of the population. Current treatments often have limitations in terms of efficacy, safety and patient satisfaction, thus a new effective treatment could disrupt the market.ABP-450, as a proprietary botulinum toxin complex, represents a novel approach in the preventive treatment of migraines. The completion of patient enrollment for the Phase 2 study and the planned interim analysis are critical steps in validating the efficacy and safety profile of the drug. The design of the study, being randomized and double-blind, is the gold standard for clinical trials and strengthens the credibility of the results.From a medical research perspective, the interim analysis could provide early indications of the drug's effectiveness. If the data is positive, it could accelerate the drug's time to market and increase the likelihood of a successful Phase 3 trial. Conversely, negative results could lead to a reassessment of the drug's viability or the need for additional studies, potentially delaying market entry. Market Research Analyst The migraine treatment market is a multi-billion-dollar industry with a continuous demand for better prophylactic treatments. AEON Biopharma's focus on both episodic and chronic migraine indicates an understanding of the diverse needs within this market. The company's alignment with the FDA on the Phase 3 trials design and endpoints is a pivotal step in ensuring the trials' relevance to both regulatory requirements and market expectations.Given that the Phase 2 study of ABP-450 has enrolled patients across multiple international sites, it suggests a global strategy for the company. This broad patient base could help in understanding the drug's efficacy across different demographics, which is essential for market adoption. Additionally, the partnership with Daewoong Pharmaceutical Co., LTD for the private placement indicates strategic collaboration, potentially opening doors to the Asian market, where Daewoong has a strong presence.Investors should monitor the upcoming topline data releases, as positive results could position AEON as a strong contender in the migraine prevention space. The impact on the stock market will likely correlate with the clinical outcomes, with potential for significant appreciation in value if the drug proves to be effective and safe. 03/29/2024 - 03:45 PM – Recent end-of-Phase 2 meeting with FDA resulted in alignment on the design and endpoints for the proposed pivotal Phase 3 trials for the preventive treatment of both episodic and chronic migraine – – Topline data from planned interim analysis of ongoing Phase 2 study in chronic migraine are expected to be announced in Q2 2024; On track to announce top-line data from the full study in Q3 2024 – – Announced private placement agreements for $15 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured convertible notes – IRVINE, Calif., March 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AEON Biopharma, Inc.

We are now well-positioned to plan for the initiation of our pivotal Phase 3 program,” commented Marc Forth, AEON’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Recently, we announced plans to conduct an interim analysis of our ongoing Phase 2 study of ABP-450 as a preventive treatment for chronic migraine, which completed enrollment in December 2023. We expect to announce the topline data from the interim analysis in the second quarter of 2024 and we anticipate the interim analysis to be statistically powered to demonstrate efficacy.” Recent Clinical and Corporate Highlights Episodic Migraine End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with U.S. FDA: Announced a productive end-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) following the Phase 2 data in episodic migraine the Company released in October 2023. The meeting resulted in a preliminary alignment on the design and endpoints for the proposed pivotal Phase 3 trials for the preventive treatment of both episodic and chronic migraine. Chronic Migraine Phase 2 Study of ABP-450: Announced completion of enrollment with the last patient first visit in the Phase 2 study of ABP-450 for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine. The Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of ABP-450 for the prevention of chronic migraine in adults who suffer from 15 or more headache days per month and at least 8 migraine days per month. The study has enrolled a total of 492 patients across approximately 50 sites in the United States, Canada and Australia.The Company introduced an updated development plan for ABP-450 that includes an interim analysis of the ongoing Phase 2 study of ABP-450 for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine in the second quarter of 2024. With data from over 300 participants that have completed the two 12-week treatment cycles, the Company anticipates the interim analysis to be statistically powered to show efficacy. $15 Million Private Placement Agreements In March 2023, the Company entered definitive agreements relating to a private placement of $15 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured convertible notes with its strategic partner, Daewoong Pharmaceutical Co., LTD. The Company has closed the first installment of $5 million and anticipates closing the second installment of $10 million in April 2024, subject to the closing conditions set forth in the definitive agreements. Proceeds from the private placement will be used to support the late-stage clinical development of ABP-450 and for general working capital purposes. The Company believes its cash, cash equivalents and investments, including the $15 million of private placement proceeds, will be sufficient to fund its planned clinical studies, as well as support corporate operations through June 2024. Key Upcoming Milestones Ongoing Chronic Migraine Phase 2 Study Expect to announce topline data from the planned interim analysis of the ongoing Phase 2 program for ABP-450 in chronic migraine in the second quarter of 2024.On track to announce topline results from the Phase 2 study of ABP-450 as a preventive treatment for chronic migraine in the third quarter of 2024. Episodic Migraine Program Next Steps – The Company is continuing to plan for the initiation of its proposed pivotal Phase 3 program for ABP-450. About Migraine Migraine is a complex neurological disease characterized by recurrent episodes of headaches that affects approximately 40 million people in the United States and approximately a billion people worldwide, making migraine the third most prevalent illness in the world. Patients that live with migraine experience symptoms that include recurring throbbing headache pain, nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, touch and smell. Migraine can be categorized as episodic migraine or chronic migraine. AEON projects that approximately 9.4 million Americans live with episodic migraine, which is characterized by fewer than 15 headache days per month and between 6 to 14 migraine days per month, but each individual attack can be just as debilitating. About ABP-450 (prabotulinumtoxinA) Injection ABP-450 contains a 900 kDa botulinum toxin type-A complex produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The active part of the botulinum toxin is the 150 kDa component, and the remaining 750 kDa of the complex is made up of accessory proteins that the Company believes help with the function of the active portion of the botulinum toxin. When injected at therapeutic levels, ABP-450 blocks peripheral acetylcholine release at presynaptic cholinergic nerve terminals by cleaving SNAP-25, a protein integral to the successful docking and release of acetylcholine from vesicles situated within the nerve endings leading to denervation and relaxation of the muscle. About AEON Biopharma AEON is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing its proprietary botulinum toxin complex, ABP-450 (prabotulinumtoxinA) injection, or ABP-450, for debilitating medical conditions, with an initial focus on the neurosciences market. AEON recently completed a Phase 2 study of ABP-450 for the treatment of cervical dystonia and has an ongoing Phase 2 study of ABP-450 for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine. ABP-450 is the same botulinum toxin complex that is currently approved and marketed for cosmetic indications by Evolus under the name Jeuveau. ABP-450 is manufactured by Daewoong in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, in a facility that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, Health Canada and European Medicines Agency, or EMA. AEON has exclusive development and distribution rights for therapeutic indications of ABP-450 in the United States, Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and certain other international territories. The Company has built a highly experienced management team with specific experience in biopharmaceutical and botulinum toxin development and commercialization.

Given these circumstances, the results were reasonable though not what we hoped for.” Mr. O’Brien continues, “There will be some residual effects of the 2023 conditions present in Q1 2024 but, we hope the rest of the year will see a return to growth, some expansion in margins and increased food division sales.” Sales for the Full Year were $38,324,806, down approximately 16% when compared to sales of $45,840,469 in the corresponding period a year ago.Full Year, 2023 net income was $2,775,864, or $0.22 per share, compared to a net income of $7,021,604, or $0.57 per share, in Full Year, 2022.Basic weighted average shares used in computing earnings per share amounts were 12,434,886 and 12,379,316 for full year, 2023 and full year, 2022 respectively.2023 Non-GAAP operating cash flow: The Company shows 12 months operating cash flow of $4,598,698, or $0.37 per share. This compares with operating cash flow of $8,442,735, or $0.68 per share, in the corresponding 12 months of 2022 (see the table that follows for details of these calculations). The NanoChem division and ENP subsidiary continue to be the dominant sources of revenue and cash flow for the Company. New opportunities continue to unfold in detergent, water treatment, oil field extraction, turf, ornamental and agricultural use to further increase sales in these divisions.

Therefore Operating Cash Flow is adjusted by the pre tax Net income or loss of the non-controlling interest(minority interest) in both entities. The 2022 number given in the financials is after tax figure. A pretax minority interest number now appears in the financials for full year 2023 and future years. b) Non-GAAP – amounts exclude certain cash and non-cash items: Depreciation and Stock compensation expense (2023 = $2,081,399, 2022 = $1,676,579), Interest expense (2023 = $498,666, 2022 = $292,949), Interest income (2023 = $113,809, 2022 = $132,233), Gain on investment (2023 = 506,098, 2022 = $341,424), gain on sale of asset (2023 = 4,589, 2022 = N/A), Gain on previously held equity interest - acquisition of ENP Peru (2023 = N/A, 2022 = $335,051), Deferred income tax recovery (expense) (2023 = $250,917, 2022 = $71,295), Income tax (2023 = 118,182, 2022 = 217,151), and pretax Net income attributable to non-controlling interests (2023 = $980,121, 2022 = $995,144). Also, the legal and accounting costs associated with the attempted merger of FSI and Lygos (2023 = N/A, 2022 = $417,974(see news releases)) are removed to arrive at Operating Cash Flow. Although included in operating expenses these onetime expenditures were not related to operations of FSI. *See the financial statements for all adjustments. c) The revenue and gain from the 50% investment in the private Florida LLC announced in January 2019 are not treated as revenue or profit from operations by Flexible Solutions given the Company only purchased 50% of the LLC. The profit is treated as investment income and therefore occurs below Operating income in the Statement of Operations. As a result, the gains from all investments (2023 = $506,098, 2022 = $341,424), including those from the Florida LLC, are removed from the calculation to arrive at Operating Cash Flow. d) Non-GAAP – amounts represent depreciation and stock compensation expense.

The company has until April 15, 2024, to regain compliance. EZGO plans to appeal the decision and is exploring options like a reverse stock split. Positive None. Negative EZGO received a delisting notice due to its Ordinary Shares closing bid price being $0.10 or less for ten consecutive trading days, indicating financial struggles. The potential delisting from Nasdaq could harm the company's reputation and investor confidence, leading to further stock price declines. EZGO's need for a reverse stock split to regain compliance may result in shareholder dilution and negative market sentiment. Financial Analyst The notice of delisting received by EZGO Technologies Ltd. from Nasdaq is a significant development that can have a material impact on the company's stock liquidity and market perception. Delisting often leads to a decrease in investor confidence and can result in a lower stock price due to the reduced visibility and trading volume that comes with being removed from a major exchange. The closing bid price falling as low as $0.10 indicates a severe lack of investor confidence and market support for the stock.Considering a reverse stock split is a common strategy to address the issue of non-compliance with minimum bid price requirements. This move can potentially bring the per-share price back above the $1.00 threshold. However, it is essential to note that while this may temporarily satisfy exchange listing requirements, it does not address the underlying business challenges that may have led to the stock's decline in value. Shareholders should closely monitor the company's operational performance and management's strategic decisions following such corporate actions. Market Research Analyst From a market dynamics perspective, EZGO's position as a provider of short-distance transportation solutions in China places it within a competitive and rapidly evolving industry. The sector is influenced by factors such as technological advancements, regulatory changes and consumer preferences. A delisting could hinder the company's ability to raise capital and invest in innovation or expansion, potentially affecting its competitive edge.Moreover, the appeal to Nasdaq's Hearings Panel suggests that the company is actively seeking to remedy the situation, but the success of such an appeal is uncertain. If the appeal fails and delisting occurs, the company may find it challenging to attract institutional investors and could become reliant on less regulated markets with higher volatility. Stakeholders should evaluate the company's strategic initiatives and market position to assess the long-term implications of the delisting process. Legal Expert Navigating the complexities of Nasdaq's compliance requirements is a critical legal challenge for EZGO. The delisting process is governed by specific rules outlined in Nasdaq's Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). The company's right to appeal provides a procedural safeguard, allowing EZGO to present a plan to regain compliance. It is important for investors to understand that the appeal process is a legal recourse that can delay, but not necessarily prevent, delisting.Should the company proceed with a reverse stock split, it must ensure adherence to both Nasdaq's procedural guidelines and any applicable securities laws. Any misstep in this process could lead to further regulatory scrutiny or investor lawsuits. Investors should consider the legal risks associated with the delisting notice and the company's compliance efforts when assessing the potential impact on their investment. 03/29/2024 - 11:00 AM CHANGZHOU, China, March 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- EZGO Technologies Ltd.

The company's buyback program aims to enhance shareholder value and comply with regulatory requirements. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst ASML's recent disclosure of their share buyback transactions provides a clear signal of the company's confidence in its intrinsic value. Share buybacks often indicate management's belief that the stock is undervalued, which can be an optimistic sign for investors. By reducing the number of shares outstanding, earnings per share (EPS) could potentially increase, making the remaining shares more valuable. This action could also support the stock price in the short term by creating additional demand for the shares.However, it's essential to assess the opportunity cost of such buybacks. The funds used for repurchasing shares could alternatively be invested in research and development or other growth opportunities. Investors should consider whether the buyback is the best use of capital, especially in the context of ASML's strategic position within the semiconductor industry, which is capital intensive and highly competitive. Market Research Analyst ASML operates in the semiconductor industry, which is currently facing dynamic challenges, including supply chain disruptions and fluctuating demand due to economic uncertainties. The share buyback program might be a strategic move to stabilize stock prices amidst such volatility. Investors should take note of the industry trends and how they might influence ASML's financial health and stock performance in the long run.Furthermore, the timing and size of the buybacks, as reported, can give insights into the company's market perception. The weighted average prices paid for the shares could be compared to historical stock performance to gauge whether the company secured a favorable price, thus effectively utilizing shareholder funds. Economist From an economic perspective, share buybacks can be reflective of broader economic conditions. In a low-interest-rate environment, companies like ASML may find it more financially sensible to return value to shareholders through buybacks rather than holding excess cash or making less attractive investments. It's a deployment of capital that must be scrutinized in the context of macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates, inflation and economic growth expectations.Investors should also consider the impact of such financial decisions on the company's balance sheet. Although buybacks can improve financial ratios, they also reduce the company's cash reserves, which could be a concern if economic conditions deteriorate. Balancing these factors is key to understanding the potential implications for ASML's financial stability and future growth prospects. 03/29/2024 - 09:00 AM ASML reports transactions under its current share buyback program VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands – ASML Holding N.V.

Indigo Partners Announces Plans to Distribute Frontier Group Holdings Common Stock to its Limited Partners,2024-03-29T18:05:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Indigo Partners  announces the distribution of Frontier Group Holdings, Inc. shares to its members, including significant shareholders William A.

Franke, George Roberts, and an investment fund advised by Wildcat Capital Management. The distribution marks the end of a 10-year investment fund managed by Indigo. The company will no longer be a 'controlled company' under Nasdaq rules post-distribution. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The distribution of Frontier Group Holdings stock by Indigo Partners to its members, including significant shareholders like William A. Franke, marks a pivotal moment in the company's ownership structure. This reallocation of approximately 44% of shares outstanding could lead to enhanced liquidity in the market as shares previously held in a private fund become available for public trading. Investors may see this as a positive signal, potentially increasing the stock's attractiveness due to the broader distribution of ownership and the anticipated corporate governance changes.However, the transition from a 'controlled company' to one with a more independent corporate governance structure may introduce new dynamics to the board's decision-making process. The requirement for a compensation committee and nominations committee consisting solely of independent directors could lead to changes in executive compensation and board composition, potentially impacting the company's strategic direction. This shift may be seen as aligning with best practices for corporate governance, potentially increasing investor confidence in the long term. Financial Analyst Frontier Group Holdings' transition away from 'controlled company' status under Nasdaq rules post-distribution could attract institutional investors seeking companies with strong governance practices. The installation of independent committees for compensation and director nominations is likely to be well-received by the market, as these structures are designed to mitigate conflicts of interest and promote transparency.On the financial side, this redistribution of shares may not immediately affect the company's fundamentals, but the market's perception of the company's governance and potential for future growth could influence the stock price. Investors will be closely monitoring the company's performance and governance changes to assess the impact on Frontier's market valuation and operational efficiency. Corporate Governance Expert Frontier's impending corporate governance changes are a significant development, as they reflect a commitment to aligning with Nasdaq's independence requirements. The resignation of William A. Franke from the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is a step towards enhancing the board's independence. This move may be interpreted as strengthening the checks and balances within the company's leadership, potentially leading to more balanced and shareholder-friendly decisions.It is important for investors to understand that while these changes are expected to be beneficial in fostering an independent board culture, they may also lead to initial uncertainties as the company adjusts to the new governance framework. The market will need time to assess how these changes affect Frontier's strategic decisions and whether they will indeed translate into value creation for shareholders. 03/29/2024 - 02:05 PM William A. Franke, George Roberts, and an Investment Fund Advised by Wildcat Capital Management Continue to Support Frontier Group Holdings as Significant Shareholders PHOENIX, March 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Indigo Partners LLC (""Indigo"") has advised Frontier Group Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: ULCC) (""Frontier"" or ""the Company""), parent company of Frontier Airlines, Inc., that it will distribute the shares of Frontier common stock owned by an affiliated investment fund to its members, including William A. Franke, Chair of the Frontier Board of Directors, and Indigo Partners investors, including George Roberts and an investment fund advised by Wildcat Capital Management, an investment advisor to a number of clients, including David Bonderman. The pro-rata, in-kind distribution is pursuant to the dissolution of the investment fund managed by Indigo established to acquire the Company in late 2013, which had a term of 10 years. Indigo currently holds 178,834,034 shares of common stock of Frontier, representing approximately 80% of the shares outstanding1.

Indigo intends to distribute the shares pro-rata to its investors unaffiliated with Mr. Franke on or around April 1, 2024. ""During the past 10 years, we have made significant progress solidifying Frontier's position as a preeminent leader in the ultra-low-cost carrier category,"" said Mr. Franke. ""While the Indigo limited partnership has come to its natural conclusion, I look forward to continuing to serve as Chair of the Frontier Board and participating in the upside of the Company's bright future."" ""I am pleased to have had the opportunity to work with Bill and David to invest in and support Frontier's growth into an industry leader throughout the duration of this limited partnership,"" said Mr. Roberts. ""As we look to this next stage in Frontier's growth, I am confident that Frontier will build on the momentum created to date."" ""I have long supported Frontier and believe it has the right strategy to compete and grow going forward,"" said Mr. Bonderman. Upon the effectiveness of the share distribution, the Company will no longer be a ""controlled company"" under the applicable rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC. Accordingly, the Company will make certain corporate governance changes following permitted phase-in periods. Among other things, the Company will be required to have a compensation committee consisting solely of independent directors, and a director nominations process whereby directors are selected by a nominations committee consisting solely of independent directors or by a vote of the Board of Directors in which only independent directors participate. As a result, William A. Franke has resigned from the Company's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Mr. Franke will remain a director and the Chair of the Board.

This achievement marks a major milestone in the integration project, showcasing the rapid development of AI technology in military aviation. Positive None. Negative None. Defense Technology Analyst The integration of Shield AI's Hivemind AI pilot into Kratos' MQM-178 Firejet represents a significant advancement in the field of autonomous military technology. The ability to rapidly adapt and deploy AI pilots across various aircraft types showcases a level of agility and innovation that is vital for maintaining a competitive edge in defense technology. This development not only enhances operational effectiveness by providing a no-risk-to-American-life solution but also has the potential to reshape military force structures. The emphasis on a high-speed, high-maneuverability and low-signature solution indicates a strategic focus on contested environments where stealth and agility are paramount.From a business perspective, the successful demonstration of this technology positions both companies at the forefront of the defense market, potentially leading to increased interest from the Department of Defense and allied nations. The mention of a sub $500K price range per aircraft suggests a cost-effective solution that could disrupt traditional procurement models and lead to a reevaluation of budget allocations within the defense sector. Aerospace Market Analyst The collaboration between Shield AI and Kratos is indicative of the evolving landscape of the aerospace defense market, where traditional hardware is increasingly being augmented with sophisticated software capabilities. The rapid development cycle, as highlighted by the transition from contract signing to flight in under 180 days, demonstrates an accelerated pace of innovation that could pressure competitors to invest more heavily in R&D to keep up.The market implications for Kratos could be significant, as this partnership and the resulting product line diversification may attract investor attention and potentially lead to stock market revaluation. The anticipated AI-piloted XQ-58 Valkyrie flights and the further development of the Kratos BQM-177 are events that market participants will likely monitor closely for their potential to generate new contracts and revenue streams. Military Strategy Consultant The strategic implications of AI-piloted aircraft are profound for military operations. The ability to deploy unmanned systems in high-threat environments without risking personnel aligns with a broader trend towards minimizing casualties in conflict scenarios. The tactical versatility of the Firejet, capable of both offensive and defensive roles, suggests a shift towards more adaptable and multi-role unmanned systems in future force structures.From a strategic standpoint, the development of portable autonomy software could lead to rapid redeployment and reconfiguration of assets, enabling forces to respond more dynamically to emerging threats. The long-term benefits of such technology could include reduced training costs, enhanced mission capabilities and the potential for a more robust and resilient military posture. 03/29/2024 - 08:55 AM Shield AI and Kratos use Firejet as a test surrogate ahead of AI-piloted flights on Kratos Valkyrie SAN DIEGO, March 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Shield AI, Inc., a defense technology company building the world's best AI pilot, and Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. (Nasdaq: KTOS), a Technology Company in the Defense, National Security and Global Markets and an industry-leading provider of high-performance, jet-powered unmanned aerial systems (UAS), today announced the successful completion of the first phase of Shield's AI-piloted flight-testing on-board Kratos platforms as the two companies move toward productizing Shield AI's pilot for the XQ-58 Valkyrie. Having successfully flown AI pilots on five aircraft — three classes of quadcopters, the MQ-35A V-BAT, and the F-16 in fully autonomous air combat training — Shield AI's Hivemind AI pilot has now successfully flown on and controlled the Kratos MQM-178 Firejet. These successful flights are a major milestone in the comprehensive integration project as Shield AI and Kratos look to ultimately productize another configuration of the Valkyrie, in this case with Shield AI's Hivemind AI pilot. ""Our substantial investments in autonomy and AI design tools, infrastructure, and pipelines are what enable Shield AI to rapidly integrate Hivemind onto different classes of aircraft and most importantly, fly them safely. We're getting faster and faster. It was over three years from signing the contract to flying the F-16; now, it's less than 180 days for the Kratos Firejet. The vision of portable autonomy software for military hardware has been realized, flown, and deployed by Shield AI,"" said Ryan Tseng, Shield AI's CEO and Co-Founder. ""AI pilots will eventually fly all aircraft and will have a larger global impact than self-driving cars. The MQM-178 Firejet marks the sixth type of aircraft that our AI pilot Hivemind has flown. It is the second jet-powered aircraft after our AI piloted F-16 dogfights. The AI-piloted XQ-58 Valkyrie flights later this year will be the seventh aircraft and then the Kratos BQM-177 will be the eighth. Kratos and Shield AI's joint focus on the rapid development of AI-piloted aircraft has been a terrific collaboration that is helping redefine military force structures,"" said Brandon Tseng, Shield AI's President and Co-Founder and a former Navy SEAL. The MQM-178 Firejet fills a variety of end-to-end weapons-release training roles as a jet target aircraft system, supporting surface-to-air and air-to-air engagements. Additionally, the Tactical Firejet offers an offensive/defensive jet UAS system in the sub $500K price range per aircraft with substantial mission systems and performance capabilities. In either mission configuration (target/tactical), the Firejet delivers a high-speed, high-maneuverability, low-signature solution for replicating threats or enabling no-risk-to-American-life operational effectiveness with a level of contested environment capability. ""The collaboration between Kratos and Shield AI over these past months has been nothing short of exceptional and represents the rapid development and testing possible when motivated commercial technology companies work together with a common objective—being first to market with relevant systems to support U.S. National Security. Our joint efforts have brought together the best of both worlds – Kratos' proven jet-powered uncrewed aircraft and Shield AI's expertise in AI and software development. We're thrilled about the progress we've made and even more excited to share further breakthroughs in the near future,"" said Steve Fendley, President of Kratos' Unmanned Systems Division.

Positive AERKOMM and IX Acquisition Corp have finalized a Business Combination Agreement. The combined entity will be known as AKOM Inc., with AERKOMM transferring its listing to Nasdaq under 'AKOM'. The transaction includes a $35 million private placement and an adjusted enterprise value of $200 million. Potential earnout shares are also part of the agreement. The completion of the transaction is anticipated in Q3 2024. Negative None. Telecommunications Industry Analyst The satellite communications sector is undergoing significant transformation, driven by advances in technology and increased demand for high-speed, reliable connectivity. The business combination between AERKOMM and IX Acquisition Corp, coupled with the $35 million PIPE investment, indicates a strategic move to enhance AERKOMM's financial standing and market reach. The transition to Nasdaq is a pivotal step for AERKOMM, as it not only aligns with the company's growth strategy but also potentially increases its visibility and access to capital among a larger pool of investors. The satellite technology market is poised for growth, with Aerospace & Defense and Civilian Telecommunications sectors expected to triple in value by 2030. This growth trajectory, supported by AERKOMM's innovative multi-orbit satellite technologies and partnerships, positions the company favorably within the industry. The company's focus on high throughput, interoperability and virtualization is particularly noteworthy, as these capabilities are critical for meeting the evolving demands of both public and private sector clients. However, it's essential to monitor the execution of AERKOMM's strategy post-transaction, especially given the competitive landscape and the technical challenges associated with deploying advanced satellite systems. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, AERKOMM's adjusted enterprise value of $200 million, with an additional potential $200 million in earnout shares, reflects a significant valuation that hinges on the company achieving certain milestones. The full equity rollover by existing shareholders into the pro forma AKOM suggests strong confidence in the future of the combined entity. The PIPE investment serves as a vote of confidence from both new and existing investors, providing necessary capital to fuel growth initiatives. It is essential, however, to scrutinize the terms of the earnout shares, as they could dilute current shareholders' equity if not structured favorably. Moreover, maintaining a secondary listing on Euronext could offer liquidity benefits and a diversified investor base. As the transaction progresses towards its expected completion in Q3 2024, investors should closely follow the company's performance against the set milestones that trigger the earnout shares, as well as the integration of IXAQ's management expertise to enhance institutional-grade practices within AERKOMM. Aerospace & Defense Market Analyst Examining the Aerospace & Defense implications, AERKOMM's collaboration with leading satellite constellation operators across multiple orbits, including LEO, MEO, GEO and HEO, is a strategic advantage. The company's semiconductor glass antenna technology, which offers a 50% increase in throughput, is a testament to its innovative edge. The emphasis on interoperability and virtualization aligns with the current trend towards a more integrated and flexible satellite communication infrastructure, which is vital for defense applications such as UAV communications. AERKOMM's anticipated first major contract in 2024 could serve as a proof point for its technology's application in the defense sector. The Aerospace & Defense market is notably stringent with its requirements for reliability and security and AERKOMM's ability to meet these demands will be important for its success in this vertical. Investors should track AERKOMM's progress in securing contracts and partnerships within this sector, as they will be significant indicators of the company's capability to deliver on its technological promises and drive growth. 03/29/2024 - 10:00 AM SILICON VALLEY, Calif., March 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AERKOMM Inc. (Euronext: AKOM, OTCQX: AKOM, “AERKOMM”), an innovative satellite technology company providing multi-orbit broadband connectivity solutions, and IX Acquisition Corp (Nasdaq: IXAQU, “IXAQ”), a SPAC focused on the technology, media and telecommunications industries, have entered into a definitive Business Combination Agreement (“BCA”) and raised US $35 million in a private placement. The combined business will be called AKOM Inc. (“AKOM”) and its ordinary shares are expected to result in AERKOMM transferring its listing from Euronext/OTCQX to Nasdaq under the ticker ""AKOM”, following the closing of the business combination. It is the intention of the combined business to also maintain a secondary listing on Euronext. Transaction highlights Adjusted enterprise value of AERKOMM is US $200 million, as well as up to US $200 million of earnout shares for the AERKOMM shareholders, if certain milestones are achieved.Transaction supported by a fund-raise of US $35 million common equity PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) subscribed concurrently with the signing of the BCA. The PIPE investors consist of new and current shareholders in AERKOMM. There may be more capital raised prior to the business combination, but there is no minimum cash condition for the transaction.Existing AERKOMM shareholders are anticipated to roll 100% of their equity and may own approximately two-thirds of the new combined pro forma AKOM, subject to final amounts of PIPE capital raised and of cash retained in IXAQ trust.The Nasdaq-listing is intended to enable AKOM to execute its strategy to provide carrier-neutral and software-defined infrastructure to deliver mission-critical, multi-orbit satellite broadband connectivity.Completion of the transaction is expected in Q3 2024, which is subject to SEC review, to approval by IXAQ and AERKOMM shareholders and to the satisfaction of certain other customary closing conditions. AERKOMM is an innovative satellite technology company, providing carrier-neutral and software-defined infrastructure for multi-orbit, end-to-end satellite broadband connectivity, serving both public and private sectors, including Aerospace & Defense and Civilian Telecommunications. AERKOMM has a range of next-generation satellite technologies that offer broadband connectivity by collaborating with satellite partners and mobile network operators to link users and platforms on the edge to core infrastructure hubs. AERKOMM has established a strong engagement with leading satellite constellation operators spanning multiple orbits, including low-earth orbit (LEO), medium-earth orbit (MEO), geostationary earth orbit (GEO) and highly elliptical orbit (HEO). Additionally, AERKOMM’s technology is currently being implemented in the Aerospace & Defense market, having been tested live in selected defense assets. AERKOMM is developing partnerships with both public and private sector clients that have increasing demands for multi-beam and multi-orbit satellite communications solutions. AERKOMM holds a strong market position. Its target markets, Aerospace & Defense and Civilian Telecommunications, are expected to grow from c. $20bn to c. $60bn by 2030 (Sources: Fortune Business Insights, Boeing 2023 Annual Report, NSR Report, Teal Group). AERKOMM has considerable technical expertise with executives and innovators drawn from semi-conductors, aerospace, defense, telecoms dual-use and satellite communications sectors. AERKOMM’s strong capabilities deliver differentiated solutions: High throughput. AERKOMM’s semiconductor glass antenna transmits and receives 50% Mbps more throughput per square-inch compared to previous state-of-the-art satellite broadband terminals.Interoperability. AERKOMM’s universal terminals, including multi-orbit glass semiconductor antennas and software-defined radio modems, provide carrier-neutral broadband connectivity. These terminals are designed to meet the diverse needs of users across various sectors, delivering high-quality connectivity and performance.Virtualization. AERKOMM’s software-defined core network waveforms integrate satellites and constellations across all major orbits, as well as advanced 5G and emerging 6G non-terrestrial networks (NTN). This approach enhances flexibility, scalability and efficiency, allowing for dynamic adaptation to evolving communication needs. Louis Giordimaina, AERKOMM Chief Executive commented: “We are delighted to be collaborating with the IXAQ team, who bring considerable sector and financial experience and expertise. We will benefit from the resources of the IXAQ team, who also have a proven track record in the international technology, media and telecoms sectors. “We are well positioned to address extremely fast-growing markets – Aerospace & Defense and Civilian Telecommunications. We are developing a range of pioneering multi-orbit satellite technologies with the capability to provide end-to-end broadband connectivity in collaboration with our satellite partners. “In the defense sector, we have been leveraging our team’s long-time focus on commercial aviation to demonstrate applications for satellite communications for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Our technology is achieving positive results in real-world settings and we anticipate commencing our first major contract in 2024. We will also continue to invest in our talent and partnerships as we position our technology to scale-up.” Karen Bach, IXAQ Chief Executive commented: “We launched IXAQ with a team of executives from the digital infrastructure and telecommunications sectors in order to add value to the management teams of our target company – in AERKOMM we have found the right opportunity. “Switching AERKOMM’s listing to Nasdaq and combining with our team of experienced operators will support the business to rapidly evolve into an institutional-grade company that is well-positioned to capitalize on the numerous opportunities in its expanding markets.” Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, both as amended.

The CEO highlighted strategic advancements and product development progress, emphasizing agreements with MDA and advancements in chip development. Positive Total revenues increased by 1% to $10.7 million in 2023 compared to $10.6 million in 2022. Gross profit decreased by 22% to $4.8 million in 2023 from $6.1 million in 2022. Operating loss rose to $41.8 million in 2023 from $22.3 million in 2022, mainly due to higher R&D costs. Cash and cash equivalents increased to $14 million in 2023 from $11.9 million in 2022. Strategic agreements with MDA and advancements in chip development were highlighted by the CEO. Negative Operating loss increased significantly in 2023 compared to 2022. Gross profit margin decreased due to lower gross margins in projects in 2023. R&D expenses surged to $29.1 million in 2023 from $16.8 million in 2022. General and administrative expenses rose to $14.6 million in 2023 from $9.2 million in 2022. Financial Analyst The financial results of SatixFy Communications Ltd. highlight a modest revenue increase alongside a significant rise in operating losses, primarily due to escalated Research and Development (R&D) costs. The focus on developing space-grade ASICs, despite reducing gross margins, indicates a strategic decision to invest in product maturity, potentially positioning the company for future growth in the satellite communications market. However, the substantial increase in R&D expenses without corresponding European Space Agency grants and tax credits raises questions about the sustainability of this investment strategy without external support.From a financial perspective, the increase in General and Administrative expenses due to legal settlements and other non-operational costs is a concern. This, combined with higher finance expenses linked to interest on advances from MDA Ltd., suggests a strain on the company's cash flow management. The slight increase in cash and cash equivalents provides a buffer, but the net financial health of the company appears to be under pressure, which could impact investor confidence and stock performance in the short term. Market Research Analyst SatixFy's engagement in the burgeoning Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite market and its focus on developing key components such as Digital Beam Formers for Direct to Device LEO constellations could signal long-term strategic positioning within the industry. With the LEO market anticipated to grow due to increasing demand for low-latency, broad data coverage, the company's product development efforts may lead to capturing significant market share. However, the current operating loss and increased expenses suggest that the return on these investments may not materialize in the immediate future.It is also essential to consider the competitive landscape and the pace of technological advancements in satellite communications. SatixFy's success will depend not only on its R&D capabilities but also on its ability to commercialize its products effectively and secure a customer base that can generate sustainable revenue streams. The reported progress towards commercialization of their Prime 2.0 and Sx4000 chips is a positive step, but the actual market adoption and performance against competitors will be key determinants of the company's financial success. Technology Industry Analyst The emphasis on R&D to bring space-grade ASICs to maturity suggests SatixFy is positioning itself at the forefront of satellite communication technology. The development of ASICs is a complex and costly endeavor, but it is important for companies looking to differentiate themselves in the market through performance and efficiency improvements. SatixFy's mention of potential capital expenditure savings and enhanced communication efficiencies for customers implies a focus on creating value through innovation.However, the financial results indicate a trade-off between current profitability and future technological gains. The increased R&D investment, while potentially leading to a competitive advantage, must be weighed against the immediate financial strain it places on the company. Stakeholders should monitor the progress of the Prime 2.0 and Sx4000 chips from customer sampling to commercial success, as this will be a critical indicator of the company's ability to convert its technological advancements into marketable products that can generate revenue and eventually lead to profitability. 03/29/2024 - 08:31 AM REHOVOT, Israel--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SatixFy Communications Ltd. (the “Company” or “SatixFy”) (NYSE AMERICAN: SATX), a pioneering force in next-generation satellite communication systems driven by in-house developed chipsets, has released its consolidated financial results for the full year period ended December 31, 2023. The Company has filed its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “Annual Report”) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and can be accessed on its website at www.SatixFy.com. Financial Highlights for the Full Year 2023 Total Revenues: $10.7 million, reflecting a 1% increase compared to $10.6 million in 2022. Gross Profit: $4.8 million, a 22% decrease from $6.1 million in 2022. The decrease in gross profit and margin due to the Company’s engagement in 2023 in projects which carry lower gross margins compared to 2022. Operating Loss: $41.8 million, compared to $22.3 million for 2022. The increase was mainly attributed to higher Research and Development (R&D) costs, as described below. Expenses Breakdown: Research and Development (R&D): $29.1 million, compared to $16.8 million for 2022. The increase in R&D expenses was mostly driven by the significant effort the Company invested into the development of its space grades Application Specific Integrated Circuit (“ASICs”) in order to bring the ASICs to maturity. Research and development expenses were also affected by a net decrease in European Space Agency grants and tax credits and a decline in contributions from government support and grants, which all are recorded as offsets to R&D expenses. Selling and Marketing: $2.9 million, compared to $2.3 million for 2022. The increase was primarily driven by increased participation in trade shows, related travel costs and a slight increase in payroll, and RSU grants. General and Administrative: $14.6 million, compared to $9.2 million for 2022. The increase was primarily driven by the settlement of a legal proceedings with Alta Partners, LLC of $2.3 million, as well as an increase in legal costs, an increase of director and officer insurance expenses, and a provision for expected credit loss. This was offset by a decrease in bonuses to the chairman of the Company’s board of directors. Finance expenses: $12 million, compared to $10 million for 2022. The increase was primarily driven by a $3 million interest expense recorded on the advanced payments from MDA Ltd. (“MDA”), offset by $1 million of currency fluctuation effects. Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $14 million compared to $11.9 million as of December 31, 2022. Management Commentary Nir Barkan, Acting Chief Executive Officer of SatixFy, commented, “2023 was marked by strategic advancements and solid progress within our product development and customer engagements. The $60 million agreement with MDA has refocused SatixFy on its core competencies, fortifying a long-term business relationship with a leading satellite developer and providing us with advanced payments for sales of the Company’s cutting-edge space-grade ASICs. From a product standpoint, the progression of our Prime 2.0 and Sx4000 chips to advanced customer sampling stages, has brought us a significant step closer towards ultimate commercialization. Our success is due to our ongoing product development, with our products offering a highly compelling value proposition, with potential for significant capital expenditure savings, improved communication efficiencies and performance, enabling a broader coverage footprint across fewer satellites. “SatixFy is at a key inflection point in the industry, driven in-part by the fast-growing Low Earth Orbit ('LEO') low-latency satellite market providing broad data coverage anywhere, anytime. We also believe that our Digital Beam Former is going to be a key component in the coming Direct to Device LEO constellations. We continue to focus on our R&D investments in order to maintain our leading edge and advance our satellite communication systems and chipsets.” About SatixFy SatixFy develops end-to-end next-generation satellite space and ground communications systems, including satellite multi beam digital antennas, user terminals and modems, based on powerful chipsets that it develops in house. SatixFy’s products include modems that feature Software Defined Radio (SDR) and Fully Electronically Steered Multi Beam Antennas (ESMA) that support the advanced communications standard DVB-S2X.

This innovation aims to provide unique dining experiences for BurgerFi Fi-natics. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The introduction of the HEINZ REMIX™ Machine by BurgerFi represents a strategic move within the fast-casual dining sector. This innovation may enhance the customer experience by offering a unique and personalized touch to their meals. From a market research perspective, customization trends have shown to increase customer engagement and brand loyalty, which could translate into higher foot traffic and potentially increased sales per customer. Furthermore, this initiative could set a precedent for competitors, potentially sparking a trend within the industry for customizable dining experiences.It is essential to monitor customer response to this new feature, as it could provide valuable data on consumer preferences and trends. This could help BurgerFi in tailoring future offerings and marketing strategies. Additionally, the novelty factor might attract media attention and social media buzz, contributing to brand visibility without significant advertising expenses. Consumer Behavior Specialist Customization in food service taps into the desire for individual expression among consumers. The HEINZ REMIX™ Machine could significantly influence consumer behavior by allowing customers to feel a sense of ownership over their dining experience. This empowerment can lead to an emotional connection with the brand, which is a powerful driver for repeat business.Another aspect to consider is the influence of such innovations on perceived value. When customers are involved in the creation process, they may perceive their meal as more valuable, which can justify premium pricing strategies. However, it's worth noting that the success of such initiatives often depends on the execution and the quality of the experience. Poor implementation could lead to negative customer feedback, which in today's digital age can spread quickly and impact the brand's reputation. Food Industry Analyst The fast-casual industry is increasingly competitive and brands like BurgerFi need to differentiate themselves to maintain market share. The HEINZ REMIX™ Machine could be a differentiator that appeals to younger demographics, such as millennials and Gen Z, who favor customization and Instagram-worthy experiences. However, the long-term impact on the business will depend on the operational efficiency of this innovation. If the sauce dispensers lead to increased wait times or require frequent maintenance, the novelty could quickly wear off.In terms of supply chain implications, BurgerFi will need to manage an inventory of sauce ingredients, which adds complexity. There could be benefits if the data collected from the machine's usage patterns leads to more efficient inventory management and reduced waste. Overall, the success of this initiative will hinge on its ability to enhance the customer experience without compromising operational effectiveness. 03/29/2024 - 12:06 PM First ever brand to have in-restaurant customizable sauce dispenser FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., March 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- BurgerFi®, owned by BurgerFi International, Inc., is taking part in the sauce revolution by being the first brand to debut the HEINZ REMIX™Machine at its 4343 N Ocean Blvd, Lauderdale-By-The-Sea, FL 33308 location.

Negative None. 03/29/2024 - 12:00 PM Reevaluating Monthly Expenses like Insurance is Crucial to Savings LOS ANGELES, March 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Finances are consistently a top concern for many Americans, with ""saving money"" among the top 10 most common New Year's resolutions. This year, Americans are more concerned than ever due to the uncertainty created by high inflation, rising interest rates, lack of income growth and dwindling savings. According to investment research site YCharts, the U.S. personal savings rate for January 2024 was 3.8% versus 19.3% in January 2021, a 15.5% drop in just three years. Here are some interesting stats on the state of the U.S. economy: Per Gallup, 45% of respondents rate the American economy as poor, with 63% saying it is getting worse, not better63% of respondents tell Gallup that high prices pose a severe or moderate financial hardshipA 2023 survey conducted by Payroll.org highlighted that 78% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, a 6% increase from the previous year. In other words, more than three-quarters of Americans struggle to save or invest after paying for their monthly expensesSimilarly, a 2023 Forbes Advisor survey revealed that nearly 70% of respondents either identified as living paycheck to paycheck (40%) or — even more concerning — reported that their income doesn't even cover their standard expenses (29%)The Labor Department reported that in October of 2023, nearly 8.4 million people held multiple jobs — the highest level since July 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic beganAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, U.S. consumer credit card debt topped $1.1 trillion in the last quarter of 2023The economy and job markets remain in a state of constant flux, which is causing many families to worry about their ability to pay an unexpected bill, continue to pay off student loans, mortgages or credit card debt, or save money for the future. ""Saving money is more than just putting spare change into a coffee can, or simply ordering takeout less often,"" said Sam Jarman, Financial Expert and Mercury Content Partner. ""Sure, those things can add up over time, but people may find that their greatest savings can come from taking a look at the necessary expenses they pay for every month, such as insurance."" Jarman recommends these four tips to help protect your finances in the coming year: Check your auto insurance coverages. There's no reason to pay for more coverage than you need, but being underinsured can leave you exposed. ""The cost of repairs after a collision have grown in recent years, both as a result of more crossovers and SUVs on the road, and more technologically advanced vehicles,"" said Jarman. ""Beyond paying for more expensive repairs if your insurance doesn't cover it, if you're underinsured, you may also be responsible for paying out of pocket for medical bills, which could potentially devastate savings for a down payment on a house, your child's college tuition or a future vacation. It's vitally important to make sure you have the right amount of auto insurance coverage to protect against unforeseen events.""Know what your homeowners insurance covers. First and foremost, be sure to read your homeowners insurance policy so you're clear about what it does and doesn't cover. It's a good idea to check in with your agent each year to ensure you have adequate coverage, especially if you've made renovations, own collectible or valuable items, or live in an area that's prone to flooding or earthquakes, as standard homeowners insurance policies typically don't cover these situations. Also, maintain a home inventory to make sure to have an accurate record of your belongings and property.Be aware of potential gaps in coverage. A standard homeowners insurance policy often doesn't cover mechanical failures to your home's appliances, HVAC or other essential systems, nor does it cover a break to service lines on your property that supply your home with electricity, gas or sewer functions. In either of these scenarios, this means you would be responsible for writing a big check to a repair company or having to purchase a pricy replacement. However, adding home systems protection and service line protection endorsements can help provide coverage for costly repairs and replacements, saving you both money and peace of mind. Pennies spent now can save you dollars down the road.Regularly shop for the best coverage and price. Insurance prices can vary significantly from company to company, so it's a good idea to take a few minutes to see if you're getting a good deal. Shop around at least once a year — making sure to look for the exact same coverage limits — to see if you can find a more affordable rate. Additionally, check what discounts your carrier may offer. You may qualify for a discount you didn't know existed.""Often, regional insurers like Mercury Insurance are more attuned to their policyholders' needs and can offer better rates,"" Jarman added. ""For example, the California Department of Insurance found that Mercury auto insurance policyholders save an average of $1008, which can go a long way in feeling more secure in your savings."" The most effective way to make sure your finances are minimally impacted by insurance costs in 2024 is to speak to an independent insurance agent. They can help make sure you have the proper amount and type of coverage to keep yourself, your family and property protected.

Lee Enterprises Adopts Limited-Duration Shareholder Rights Plan,2024-03-29T14:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Lee Enterprises, Incorporated (NASDAQ: LEE) announced the adoption of a -duration shareholder rights plan in response to Quint Digital 's significant accumulation of over 12.4% of Lee's common stock. The plan aims to protect all shareholders' long-term value and ensure fair treatment in the event of a takeover. The Board may consider terminating the plan earlier if needed.","Lee Enterprises Adopts Limited-Duration Shareholder Rights Plan Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Lee Enterprises, Incorporated (NASDAQ: LEE) announced the adoption of a -duration shareholder rights plan in response to Quint Digital 's significant accumulation of over 12.4% of Lee's common stock. The plan aims to protect all shareholders' long-term value and ensure fair treatment in the event of a takeover. The Board may consider terminating the plan earlier if needed. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Shareholder rights plans, often referred to as 'poison pills', are strategic mechanisms used by companies to defend against hostile takeover attempts. Lee Enterprises' adoption of a rights plan in response to Quint Digital's significant share accumulation is a defensive move to maintain control and safeguard shareholder interests. By setting a 15% trigger, the plan aims to prevent any single entity from gaining undue influence without offering a fair premium to all shareholders.This move can be seen as a protective measure for the company's long-term strategy, especially when the acquiring entity is a competitor. It ensures that the management retains negotiating power and that any takeover bid reflects the true value of the company. For investors, this could mean stability in the company's direction and potential preservation of value. However, it also may signal to the market that the company is at risk of a takeover, which could affect stock volatility in the short term. Corporate Governance Expert The unanimous decision by Lee Enterprises' Board to implement a shareholder rights plan reflects a strong stance on corporate governance and shareholder equality. The absence of dead-hand features in the plan indicates a future-oriented approach, allowing subsequent boards the flexibility to redeem the rights if deemed beneficial to the shareholders. This aspect of the plan adheres to best practices in corporate governance, ensuring that future management teams are not unduly constrained by the decisions of their predecessors.Investors should note that while such plans are common among publicly traded companies, their activation could lead to a temporary perception of instability. It's essential for shareholders to closely monitor the company's communications and the actions of Quint Digital to understand the evolving dynamics and potential impact on their investments. Market Research Analyst The competitive landscape in the media tech market is highlighted by Lee Enterprises' response to Quint Digital's share accumulation. The rights plan could be seen as a signal of the strategic importance of BLOX Digital, Lee's subsidiary and its relevance to the company's overall market positioning. By preventing a competitor from potentially leveraging a significant ownership stake to influence company strategy or operations, Lee is safeguarding its competitive edge.From a market perspective, the rights plan could have implications for both Lee Enterprises and Quint Digital. For Lee, it can ensure independence and the ability to execute on its strategic vision without external pressures. For Quint, this move may either be a roadblock to their expansion plans or a catalyst for a more aggressive acquisition strategy. Market observers should watch for any shifts in competitive strategy that may arise from this standoff. 03/29/2024 - 10:00 AM Board Acted in Response to a Significant Accumulation of Stock to Protect Long-Term Value for All ShareholdersDAVENPORT, Iowa, March 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lee Enterprises, Incorporated (NASDAQ: LEE) (“Lee” or the “Company”), today announced that its Board of Directors (the “Board”) has unanimously adopted a limited-duration shareholder rights plan (“Rights Plan”). The Rights Plan is effective immediately and will expire on March 27, 2025. The Board may consider an earlier termination of the Rights Plan if circumstances warrant. The Board, in consultation with its legal advisors, adopted the Rights Plan in response to the significant accumulation of shares of Lee common stock by Quint Digital Limited, an entity based in India (together with its promoters and affiliates, “Quint”). In adopting the Rights Plan, the Board considered among other things, that Quint: Rapidly built and increased its ownership position to more than 12.4% of the Company’s outstanding common stock, and in recent discussions with the Company, Quint indicated its intent to continue to accumulate LEE shares,Controls a digital publishing business that offers a content management system that seeks to compete with the Company’s subsidiary, BLOX Digital, andHighlighted its ownership stake in Lee in its public materials, including a February 28th press release that outlines its strategy for expansion into the North American media tech market. “Consistent with its fiduciary duties, the Lee Board determined that based on the circumstances it was necessary to adopt a rights plan to protect the long-term interests of all Lee shareholders,” said Mary Junck, Chairman of the Board. She continued, “The Company has maintained open dialogue with Quint Digital and plans to continue these conversations.” The Rights Plan is intended to enable the Company’s shareholders to realize the long-term value of their investment, ensure that all shareholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of the Company, and to guard against tactics to gain control of the Company without paying all shareholders an appropriate premium for that control. The Rights Plan applies equally to all current and future shareholders and is not intended to deter offers or preclude the Lee Board from considering offers that are fair and otherwise in the best interest of the Company’s shareholders. The Rights Plan is similar to plans adopted by other publicly traded companies in the United States. Pursuant to the Rights Plan, the Company is issuing one right for each share of common stock as of the close of business on April 8, 2024. The rights will initially trade with Lee common stock and will generally become exercisable only if any person (or any persons acting as a group) acquires 15% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock (the “triggering percentage”). The Rights Plan does not aggregate the ownership of shareholders “acting in concert” unless and until they have formed a group under applicable securities laws. If the rights become exercisable, all holders of rights (other than any triggering person) will be entitled to acquire shares of common stock at a 50% discount or the Company may exchange each right held by such holders for one share of common stock. Under the Rights Plan, any person which currently owns more than the triggering percentage may continue to own its shares of common stock but may not acquire any additional shares without triggering the Rights Plan. The Rights Plan does not contain any dead-hand, slow-hand, no-hand or similar feature that limits the ability of a future board of directors to redeem the rights. Further details about the Rights Plan will be contained in a Form 8-K to be filed by the Company with the SEC.

Shenandoah Telecommunications Company Completes Sale of its Towers,2024-03-29T17:00:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"Shenandoah Telecommunications Company (SHEN) completes the sale of its tower portfolio to Vertical Bridge for $309.9 million, aiming to fund the acquisition of Horizon Telcom and expand Glo Fiber.","Shenandoah Telecommunications Company Completes Sale of its Towers Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Shenandoah Telecommunications Company (SHEN) completes the sale of its tower portfolio to Vertical Bridge for $309.9 million, aiming to fund the acquisition of Horizon Telcom and expand Glo Fiber. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The divestiture of Shentel's Tower Portfolio for $309.9 million in cash is a strategic move that unlocks capital for the company. By liquidating a tangible asset, Shentel gains liquidity, which can be immediately redeployed to fund its acquisition of Horizon Telcom. This acquisition is a clear indicator of Shentel's commitment to expanding its service offerings and potentially increasing its market share in the telecommunications sector.From a financial standpoint, the cash infusion from the sale could strengthen Shentel's balance sheet, potentially improving its creditworthiness and investor appeal. However, the loss of revenue from the Tower Portfolio must be balanced against the future revenue expected from the expansion of Glo Fiber. Investors should monitor how quickly Shentel can scale its fiber operations and whether this expansion can offset the divested tower revenues. Market Research Analyst The push towards a fiber-first strategy highlights Shentel's response to the growing demand for high-speed internet. By planning to expand Glo Fiber to around 600,000 homes and businesses by 2026, Shentel is aiming to capitalize on the shift towards remote work, online education and streaming services that require robust internet infrastructure.While the expansion is ambitious, it's essential to consider the competitive landscape. Larger players with more substantial resources could pose a threat to Shentel's market penetration efforts. Additionally, the success of this strategy hinges on execution and the ability to deliver quality service to new customers. Market reception to Glo Fiber's expansion will be a critical factor to watch in evaluating Shentel's long-term growth prospects. Telecommunications Industry Expert The sale of tower assets is becoming an increasingly common practice in the telecommunications industry as companies seek to divest non-core assets and focus on service delivery. Shentel's move aligns with this trend, allowing the company to concentrate on its core competency of providing telecommunications services rather than managing tower infrastructure.However, this strategy is not without risks. Owning tower assets can provide a stable revenue stream and control over the infrastructure. By selling its towers, Shentel is relying on third-party providers, which could introduce operational risks and potential increased costs in the long term. Stakeholders should assess whether Shentel's management can navigate these challenges and maintain service quality and profitability. 03/29/2024 - 01:00 PM EDINBURG, Va., March 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Shenandoah Telecommunications Company (“Shentel” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: SHEN) announced that it has completed the initial closing of the previously disclosed sale of its tower portfolio and operations (“Tower Portfolio”) to Vertical Bridge Holdco, LLC (“Vertical Bridge”) for $309.9 million in cash. “The proceeds from the sale of our Tower Portfolio will be used to fund the previously announced acquisition of Horizon Telcom and provide growth capital to accelerate our fiber-first strategy and planned expansion of Glo Fiber to approximately 600,000 homes and business passings by year-end 2026,” said Shentel’s President and CEO, Christopher E. French.

Financial Analyst The reported annual revenue growth of 123.5% for Elevai Labs Inc. is a significant indicator of the company's expanding foothold in the medical aesthetics market. This growth rate is particularly impressive in a sector that is highly competitive and sensitive to consumer trends. The quarter-over-quarter revenue increase of 25.9% also suggests strong sales momentum, which could be attributed to successful marketing strategies or product launches that resonate with consumer demands.However, the increase in operating expenses by 100.9% year-over-year and 33.9% quarter-over-quarter raises concerns about the company's cost management. While investing in growth is essential, this substantial rise in expenses could be a red flag if not accompanied by a proportional increase in revenue streams in the future. The total comprehensive loss reported indicates that despite revenue growth, profitability is still a challenge and investors should monitor how the company plans to address this in the coming quarters. Market Research Analyst The medical aesthetic industry is witnessing a surge in demand, with consumers increasingly seeking skincare and aesthetic treatments. Elevai Labs Inc.'s focus on physician-dispensed skincare positions it well within a niche market, potentially driving its substantial revenue growth. The CEO’s statement about advancements at the interface between aesthetics and biotechnology suggests an emphasis on innovation, which could be a key differentiator in attracting customers.However, the slight decrease in gross margin from 67.2% to 66.1% year-over-year could indicate rising costs or pricing pressures. This warrants attention as it could affect the company's ability to maintain profitability as it scales. Moreover, the skincare market is influenced by consumer loyalty and brand reputation, which can be volatile. The company's future performance will likely depend on its ability to maintain customer trust and adapt to market trends. Medical Research Analyst The impressive revenue growth reported by Elevai Labs Inc. can be partially attributed to the increasing consumer trust in evidence-based skincare, which is a growing trend within the medical aesthetics sector. The company's ability to more than double its revenue suggests that its products are well-received in the market, possibly due to their effectiveness or innovation in skin health.However, the biotechnology advancements mentioned by the CEO must translate into tangible products that offer real clinical benefits to sustain long-term growth. The medical aesthetics field is fast-evolving, with new treatments and technologies emerging regularly. Keeping pace with these innovations while managing R&D costs will be critical for Elevai Labs Inc. to continue its growth trajectory and eventually turn a profit. 03/29/2024 - 12:00 PM Company reports record annual revenues of $1.71 Million for 2023, up 123.5% over the previous year Company reports record Q4 2023 revenues of $698,591, up 403% from Q4 2022 NEWPORT BEACH, Calif., March 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Elevai Labs Inc.

The Offers are contingent upon the closing of a merger with APA Holders of validly tendered Notes will receive Total Consideration per $1,000 principal amount, including a Consent Fee. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Callon Petroleum's tender offers for its high-yield senior notes are a strategic move to manage the company's debt profile. By repurchasing these notes, Callon is potentially reducing future interest expenses, which could improve net income and cash flow margins in the long term. This is particularly important for energy companies, which operate in a highly volatile market where cash flow stability is key to weathering fluctuations in commodity prices.The tender offer is also indicative of the company's confidence in the completion of its merger with APA Corporation. The success of such an offer often hinges on the company's financial health and the perceived benefits of the merger. Investors should note that the merger's consummation is a condition for the purchase of the tendered notes, which introduces an element of uncertainty into the transaction.Another financial nuance is the inclusion of a consent fee, which incentivizes note holders to participate before a certain deadline, thereby giving the company a clearer picture of its post-offer debt structure earlier in the process. The high participation rate in the tender offer suggests that investors are receptive to the company's financial strategy and the terms of the offer. Market Research Analyst Looking at the broader market implications, Callon Petroleum's tender offer reflects a trend in the energy sector towards consolidation and debt restructuring. With the energy market's shift towards efficiency and sustainability, companies are increasingly looking to optimize their capital structures and strengthen their balance sheets.The willingness of note holders to tender their securities also signals market confidence in Callon's operational strategy and its merger prospects with APA. It is important for market observers to track such transactions as they can influence investor sentiment and impact the stock's performance. A successful merger and debt restructuring could position Callon more favorably against its competitors, potentially leading to an improved market valuation.However, the market should remain cautious until the merger is finalized, as any setbacks could affect the anticipated benefits of the tender offer and the proposed debt amendments. The energy sector is known for its unpredictability and while the tender offer suggests a positive outlook, unforeseen market shifts can alter the landscape significantly. Legal Expert The tender offer and consent solicitation process involves complex legal considerations, particularly regarding the proposed amendments to the indentures governing the notes. The solicitation of consents for amendments that eliminate restrictive covenants and certain default provisions can have significant legal implications for the rights of note holders.By obtaining the consents of a majority of note holders, Callon is effectively altering the terms of its debt agreements, which could have various legal ramifications. For instance, the removal of restrictive covenants could provide Callon with greater operational flexibility, but it also reduces certain protections for note holders. This balance between corporate maneuverability and creditor safeguards is a delicate aspect of corporate finance law.The decision to execute supplemental indentures upon the satisfaction of the merger condition demonstrates a legal strategy that aligns the company's debt structure with its anticipated post-merger operations. However, the legal complexities of such transactions necessitate careful scrutiny by stakeholders to ensure their interests are adequately protected in the new debt arrangements. 03/29/2024 - 08:00 AM HOUSTON, March 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Callon Petroleum Company (NYSE: CPE) (""Callon"" or the ""Company"") today announced the expiration and final tender results of its previously announced cash tender offers (the ""Offers"") for any and all of its 8.000% Senior Notes due 2028 (the ""2028 Notes"") and any and all of its 7.500% Senior Notes due 2030 (the ""2030 Notes"" and, together with the 2028 Notes, the ""Notes"").

King & Co, Inc., the Information Agent and Tender Agent for the Offers, $615,000 aggregate principal amount of 2028 Notes and $177,000 aggregate principal amount of 2030 Notes were validly tendered after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 14, 2024 (the ""Consent Fee Deadline"") but at or prior to the Expiration Time, pursuant to the Offers.

Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Offers, including satisfaction of the Merger Condition, the Company expects to accept for purchase on April 1, 2024 (the ""Settlement Date"") all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Expiration Time. Holders of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the Consent Fee Deadline, and accepted for purchase, will receive total consideration per $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase equal to the fixed spread (the ""Fixed Spread"") plus a yield based on the bid-side price of the U.S. Treasury Reference Security, each as specified in the table below (the ""Total Consideration""), which includes a consent fee of $30 per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes (the ""Consent Fee""), plus accrued and unpaid interest from and including the last interest payment date up to, but excluding, the Settlement Date. Holders who validly tendered their Notes after the Consent Fee Deadline but at or prior to the Expiration Time, and whose Notes are accepted for purchase, will be entitled to receive the Total Consideration less the Consent Fee (the ""Tender Offer Consideration"").

(2) The Total Consideration for Notes validly tendered prior to the Consent Fee Deadline and accepted for purchase is calculated using the Fixed Spread and is inclusive of the Consent Fee. The early results of the Offers were previously announced in the press release dated March 15, 2024. As disclosed therein, $641,128,000 aggregate principal amount of 2028 Notes, or approximately 98.6% of the then-outstanding 2028 Notes, and $584,213,000 aggregate principal amount of 2030 Notes, or approximately 97.4% of the then-outstanding 2030 Notes, were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Consent Fee Deadline, in accordance with the Statement. In connection with the Offers, the Company also solicited (the ""Consent Solicitations"") consents (""Consents"") from the holders of the Notes for certain proposed amendments (the ""Proposed Amendments"") that would, among other things, eliminate substantially all restrictive covenants and certain of the default provisions contained in each of the indentures governing the Notes. All tenders of Notes under the procedures described in the Statement constituted the consent of the holder thereof to the Proposed Amendments. Because Consents of the holders of at least a majority of the aggregate principal amount of each series of the Notes were received as of the Consent Fee Deadline, the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee under the indentures governing the Notes, executed and delivered supplemental indentures to the indentures governing each series of the Notes implementing the Proposed Amendments, to become operative upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Offers, including the satisfaction of the Merger Condition. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions, as applicable, it is expected that the Proposed Amendments will become operative on the Settlement Date. Upon becoming operative, the Proposed Amendments will apply to all holders of each series of the Notes.

The vessels, designed for the U.S. Marine Corps, aim to enhance mission success rates for dispersed Marine fire units with their low profile and long-range capabilities. Positive None. Negative None. Defense Technology Analyst The participation of Leidos-designed uncrewed and autonomous-capable low-profile vessels (LPVs) in military exercises marks a significant step in the evolution of maritime military technology. The focus on autonomous capabilities reflects a broader trend in defense where there is an increasing reliance on unmanned systems to perform a variety of tasks traditionally handled by crewed vehicles. This is driven by the need to reduce risk to human life and to increase operational efficiency.The LPVs' design, emphasizing a low visual profile and the ability to transport logistics payloads over long ranges, suggests that these vessels are intended to enhance the Marine Corps' logistical operations, particularly in contested environments. The ability to support dispersed fire units with a reduced probability of detection could provide a tactical advantage, thereby potentially altering threat assessments and engagement strategies of adversaries.The ongoing testing and technical assessment of these vessels, including their integration into joint and multi-national exercises like Project Convergence, are important for validating their operational effectiveness and reliability. As these vessels transition from prototypes to operational assets, they could represent a new class of support vessels within the U.S. military's arsenal, with implications for future procurement and force structure decisions. Military Procurement Specialist Leidos' delivery of the LPVs under contract with MilTech aligns with the U.S. military's strategic objective to leverage innovation from private sector and academic partnerships. The integration of these vessels into military exercises demonstrates the practical application of research and development efforts in a field setting, which is a critical step in the defense procurement process.From a procurement perspective, the successful deployment of these vessels could lead to increased demand for autonomous maritime systems. This could influence defense spending and budget allocations, with potential ripple effects across the defense industry. Companies that specialize in maritime autonomy and related technologies might see a growing market for their products and services.Furthermore, the operation and maintenance contract awarded to Leidos for the Navy's Overlord and medium unmanned surface vessels underlines the company's growing role in the field of maritime autonomy. It suggests that Leidos is positioning itself as a key player in this niche market, which could have implications for the company's financial performance and stock valuation, particularly if they secure additional contracts in this domain. Financial Analyst For investors, Leidos' involvement in Project Convergence and its maritime autonomy portfolio could be indicative of the company's future revenue streams and growth potential. The successful delivery and testing of LPVs may enhance the company's reputation as an innovator in defense technology, potentially leading to new contracts and partnerships.As Leidos continues to expand its portfolio in autonomous systems, it is essential to monitor the company's ability to scale production and integrate these systems into the existing military infrastructure. The long-term financial impact will depend on the Department of Defense's continued investment in unmanned systems and the outcomes of ongoing testing and exercises.Investors should consider the competitive landscape and the possibility of budget constraints or shifts in military strategy that could affect the demand for such technologies. While the current involvement in high-profile military exercises is positive, it is also important to assess the sustainability of this growth area within the broader defense sector. 03/29/2024 - 08:00 AM RESTON, Va., March 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Two Leidos-designed uncrewed and autonomous-capable low-profile vessels (LPVs) recently participated in the Project Convergence Capstone 4 military exercises in California. Leidos (NYSE: LDOS), a Fortune® 500 innovation company, delivered the vessels to the U.S. Marine Corps last year. ""Leidos once again designed and delivered innovative solutions with these LPVs, and it was great to see them participate in Project Convergence,"" said Dave Lewis, Leidos senior vice president, Sea Systems Business Area. ""The prototypes we've delivered will help create new disruptive logistics capabilities for the Marine Corps. Its low profile and long range are intended to help the vessels achieve a higher mission success rate supporting dispersed Marine fire units than conventional methods."" The LPV's low-to-the-water visual profile helps to reduce probability of detection. The vessels are intended to transport a logistics payload of up to five tons over a range of 2,000 nautical miles, and have been built to experiment with different autonomous control systems. The two LPV prototypes were delivered last year to the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory for testing and technical assessment. Their participation in the joint and multi-national Project Convergence Capstone 4 exercises represents the next stage of testing and experimentation with the vessels' capabilities alongside warfighters. Leidos designed the LPVs under contract with MilTech, a Montana State University research lab and an authorized National Government Partnership Intermediary. The delivery of the LPV prototypes complements Leidos' extensive maritime autonomy portfolio. Leidos-designed and built autonomous vessels recently completed joint naval exercises in the western Pacific as part of the Navy's Integrated Battle Problem 23.2. Last year, Leidos was awarded a U.S. Navy task order to manage, operate and maintain the Navy's Overlord and medium unmanned surface vessels. About Leidos Leidos is a Fortune 500® innovation company rapidly addressing the world's most vexing challenges in national security and health. The company's global workforce of 47,000 collaborates to create smarter technology solutions for customers in heavily regulated industries.

"The Typical Homebuyer’s Down Payment Is $56,000, Up 24% From a Year Ago",2024-03-29T12:00:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"Redfin reports a significant increase in median down payment for U.S. homebuyers in February, with over one-third of home purchases made in all cash.

Home prices rose by 6.6% year over year, leading to higher down payments. Elevated housing costs and mortgage rates are encouraging larger down payments. The use of all-cash purchases and FHA loans has increased, with conventional loans remaining the most common type. Various metros saw significant changes in down payment amounts and percentages, as well as in the share of all-cash purchases. Positive None. Negative None. Real Estate Market Analyst The surge in median down payments for U.S. homebuyers reflects a more complex dynamic within the real estate market. The 24.1% year-over-year increase is a significant indicator of the changing landscape of home financing. This trend is likely driven by a combination of rising home prices and higher mortgage rates, which have encouraged buyers to increase their initial investment to secure more favorable loan terms. The larger down payments are likely a strategic move to mitigate the impact of higher monthly interest payments over the lifetime of the mortgage.Furthermore, the shift toward all-cash purchases, accounting for over one-third of U.S. home purchases, suggests a competitive market where liquidity is a key advantage. This trend may be influencing market dynamics by potentially sidelining first-time buyers and those without substantial savings or equity from previous home sales. The implications for the broader economy include a potential widening of the wealth gap, as homeownership becomes increasingly challenging for certain segments of the population. Economist The data indicating a rise in all-cash home purchases and larger down payments may signal a deeper economic trend. The housing market often serves as a barometer for economic health and the current conditions suggest that buyers with significant financial resources are gaining an edge. This could exacerbate wealth disparities, as access to homeownership is a traditional pathway to building intergenerational wealth. The increase in FHA loan usage, while a positive sign for accessibility, also underscores the challenges faced by buyers with less capital.Moreover, the regional disparities in down payment sizes and all-cash purchases highlight the uneven economic recovery across different areas. For instance, metros with a high concentration of veterans or lower home prices have smaller down payment percentages, reflecting the influence of VA loans and local economic conditions. These variations are important for stakeholders to consider, as they may affect regional housing market stability and growth prospects. Mortgage Industry Expert Examining the recent uptick in down payment sizes and the prevalence of all-cash purchases, it is evident that the mortgage industry is experiencing a shift. High mortgage rates have incentivized buyers to explore alternative financing strategies, such as increasing down payments to lower monthly costs or bypassing mortgages altogether with cash purchases. This shift may lead to a contraction in demand for mortgage products, particularly those with less competitive rates.Additionally, the slight increase in the use of jumbo loans reflects a market that is still accommodating for luxury buyers, who may not be as affected by interest rate fluctuations. The mortgage industry must adapt to these changing consumer behaviors, potentially by offering more flexible or innovative loan products to remain appealing to a broader range of buyers. 03/29/2024 - 08:00 AM Redfin reports over one-third of home purchases in February were made in all cash—not far from the record high SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- (NASDAQ: RDFN) — The median down payment for U.S. homebuyers was $55,640 in February, according to a new report from Redfin (redfin.com), the technology-powered real estate brokerage. That’s up 24.1% from $44,850 a year earlier—the largest annual increase in percentage terms since April 2022. The typical homebuyer’s down payment last month was equal to 15% of the purchase price, up from 10% a year earlier. This is based on a Redfin analysis of county records across 40 of the most populous U.S. metropolitan areas going back through 2011. “Homebuyers are doing whatever they can to pull together a large down payment in order to lower their monthly payments moving forward,” said Rachel Riva, a Redfin real estate agent in Miami. “The smallest down payment I’ve seen recently is 25%. I had one client who put down 40%.” Home prices rose 6.6% year over year in February, which is part of the reason down payments increased; a higher home price naturally leads to a higher down payment because the down payment is a percentage of the home price. But elevated housing costs (from both high prices and high mortgage rates) are also incentivizing buyers to take out larger down payments. A bigger down payment means a smaller total loan amount, and a smaller loan amount means smaller monthly interest payments. For example, a buyer who purchases today’s median-priced U.S. home ($374,500) and puts 15% down would have a monthly payment of $2,836 at the current 6.79% mortgage rate. A buyer who puts 10% down on that same home with that same rate would have a monthly payment of $2,968. That’s $132 more per month, which adds up over the course of a mortgage. Mortgage rates are down from their October peak of roughly 8%, but are still more than double the all-time low hit during the pandemic. Over 1 in 3 Home Purchases Are Made With Cash—a Near Record Share Over one-third (34.5%) of U.S. home purchases in February were made with all cash, up from 33.4% a year earlier. That’s just shy of the 34.8% decade-high hit in November, and isn’t far below the record high of 38% hit in 2013. Redfin defines an all-cash purchase as a home purchase with no mortgage loan information on the deed. Some homebuyers are paying in cash for the same reason others are taking out large down payments: elevated mortgage interest rates. While a large down payment helps ease the sting of high rates by reducing monthly interest payments, an all-cash purchase removes the sting altogether because it means a buyer isn’t paying interest at all. Most buyers, though, can’t afford to pay in cash, and many can’t afford a big down payment either. First-time buyers, especially, are at a disadvantage in today’s market. That’s because they don’t have equity from the sale of a previous home to bolster their down payments, and are often competing against all-cash offers, which sellers tend to favor. Many all-cash offers come from investors, who were buying up more than one-quarter of the country’s low-priced homes as of the end of last year. Overall, though, investors are purchasing far fewer homes than they were during the pandemic housing boom. “High mortgage rates are widening the wealth gap between people of different races, generations and income levels,” said Redfin Economics Research Lead Chen Zhao. “They’ve added fuel to the fire lit by surging home prices during the pandemic, creating a reality where in many places, wealthy Americans are the only ones who can afford to buy homes. Meanwhile, people who are priced out of homeownership are missing out on a major wealth building opportunity, which could have financial implications for their children and even their children’s children.” FHA Loans More Popular Than They Were During Pandemic Because the Market Is Less Competitive Roughly one in six (15.5%) mortgaged U.S. home sales used an FHA loan in February, up from 14.9% a year earlier and just shy of the 16.3% four-year high hit a month earlier. FHA loans are more common than they were during the pandemic homebuying boom (they represented 12.1% of mortgaged sales in February 2022) because the market today is less competitive. Roughly one in 14 (7%) mortgaged home sales used a VA loan in February, down from 8% a year earlier. The share of home sales using a VA loan typically doesn’t change much over time, though it fluctuated more than usual during the topsy-turvy pandemic market. Conventional loans are the most common type, representing over three-quarters (77.5%) of mortgaged home sales in February, up slightly from 77.1% a year earlier. Jumbo loans—used for higher loan amounts and popular among luxury buyers—represented 5.3% of mortgaged sales, compared with 4.7% a year earlier. Metros with biggest increases/decreases in down payment amounts In Las Vegas, the median down payment jumped 60.9% year over year—the largest increase among the metros Redfin analyzed. Next came San Diego (49.8%), Charlotte, NC (47.4%), Virginia Beach, VA (45%) and Newark, NJ (32.2%). Down payments only fell in two metros: Milwaukee (-13.9%) and Pittsburgh (-0.4%). Metros with highest/lowest down payment percentages In San Francisco, the median down payment was equal to 25% of the purchase price—the highest among the metros Redfin analyzed. It was followed by San Jose, CA (24.9%) and Anaheim, CA (21.9%). The following metros all had median down payments of 20%: Fort Lauderdale, FL, Los Angeles, Miami, Montgomery County, PA, New Brunswick, NJ, New York, Oakland, CA, Sacramento, CA, San Diego, Seattle and West Palm Beach, FL. Down payment percentages were lowest in Virginia Beach (1.8%), Detroit (5%), Pittsburgh (5%), Baltimore (5%) and Philadelphia (7.3%). While the Bay Area has among the most expensive home prices, it also has a high concentration of wealthy residents, many of whom can afford large down payments. Meanwhile, Virginia Beach is at the bottom of the list because it has a high concentration of veterans, many of whom take out VA loans, which require little to no down payment. Metros where all-cash purchases are most/least common In Jacksonville, FL, 54.4% of home purchases were made in cash—the highest share among the metros Redfin analyzed. Next came West Palm Beach (53.4%), Cleveland (48.8%), Fort Lauderdale (46.2%) and Atlanta (46.1%). These metros are popular among investors, who often pay in cash. All-cash purchases were least common in San Jose (18%), Oakland (21.6%), San Diego (21.7%), Los Angeles (23%) and Providence, RI (23.3%). Metros with biggest increases/decreases in share of all-cash purchases In Atlanta, 46.1% of home purchases were made in cash, up 12.5 percentage points from a year earlier—the largest increase among the metros Redfin analyzed. It was followed by Jacksonville (8 ppts), Oakland (6.2 ppts), Portland, OR (5.7 ppts) and New Brunswick (5.2 ppts). In Columbus, OH, 28.5% of home purchases were made in cash, down 6.1 percentage points from a year earlier—the largest decrease among the metros Redfin analyzed. Next came Cincinnati (-4.4 ppts), Philadelphia (-3.3 ppts), Chicago (-3.3 ppts) and Phoenix (-2.8 ppts).

The funding runway extended into the third quarter of 2025, following private placements and anticipated funding, indicates a solid short-term financial position, reducing immediate liquidity concerns. However, the increase in R&D expenses reflects the company's investment in its pipeline, which could lead to volatility in its financials, depending on the outcomes of ongoing trials.From an investment perspective, the reduced SG&A expenses, due to the divestment of the commercial portfolio, may be seen as a cost-saving measure, improving operational efficiency. The shift in strategy, focusing on a niche market of rare ocular diseases, could potentially offer a high reward, but it also carries significant risk due to the inherent uncertainty of clinical trial outcomes. Medical Research Analyst With the CHASE trial targeting topline data by year-end 2024, KALA BIO is positioning KPI-012 as a potential first-mover in the PCED market. The emphasis on a multifactorial mechanism of action suggests a comprehensive approach to addressing the underlying etiologies of PCED. The medical community and potential investors will be closely monitoring the progress, as positive trial results could disrupt the current treatment paradigm and establish a new standard of care.However, the path to FDA approval is complex and the designation of the CHASE trial as one of two pivotal trials for a BLA submission adds layers of regulatory scrutiny. The long-term success hinges on trial outcomes and subsequent regulatory discussions. The exploration into additional indications like LSCD expands the potential impact of KPI-012, but also requires careful consideration of the distinct pathophysiological mechanisms involved in these diseases. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the market potential for KPI-012, the estimated incidence of PCED and LSCD in the U.S. signifies a considerable market opportunity. The lack of FDA-approved prescription products for broad indications of PCED positions KPI-012 to potentially capture a significant market share. The strategic evaluation of KPI-012 for additional rare ocular diseases suggests a deliberate expansion of the target market, which could enhance the commercial viability of KALA BIO's pipeline.However, investor sentiment may be influenced by the competitive landscape and the potential entry of new treatments. Market dynamics, such as reimbursement policies and the adoption rate by healthcare providers, will be critical in determining the commercial success of KPI-012, should it gain regulatory approval. 03/29/2024 - 08:00 AM -- Advancing ongoing Phase 2b CHASE trial of KPI-012 for PCED; topline data targeted by year-end 2024 ---- Exploring opportunities to expand KPI-012 into additional corneal indications ---- Cash resources as of December 31, 2023, together with proceeds from the March 2024 private placement and anticipated funding remaining from CIRM award, expected to fund operations into 3Q 2025 -- ARLINGTON, Mass., March 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KALA BIO, Inc. (NASDAQ:KALA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the research, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for rare and severe diseases of the eye, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023 and provided a corporate update. “In 2023, we focused on clinical execution, advancing our Phase 2b CHASE trial of KPI-012 for the treatment of PCED. In March 2023, we announced positive safety data from the first cohort of patients, reinforcing the promising safety and tolerability profile of high dose KPI-012, and allowing us to progress into the multicenter, randomized, double-masked efficacy cohort, which we are targeting to read out by year-end 2024,” said Mark Iwicki, Chair and Chief Executive Officer of KALA BIO. “Based on its multifactorial mechanism of action, we believe KPI-012 may address a significant unmet need, potentially offering patients and physicians a highly differentiated product profile and the first therapy for PCED that addresses the multiple underlying etiologies of the disease. We look forward to topline data from the CHASE trial, as we work to establish KPI-012 as a safe, well-tolerated, easily administered and effective treatment for the nearly 100,000 patients living with PCED in the U.S.” Fourth Quarter and Recent Business Highlights: Development-Stage Pipeline:KALA is advancing an innovative pipeline based on its proprietary mesenchymal stem cell secretome (MSC-S) platform. KALA believes the multifactorial mechanism of action of its MSC-S platform technology may enable it to generate products for a range of ocular orphan diseases and is evaluating the potential development of this technology for multiple rare, front- and back-of-the-eye diseases. KPI-012 combines growth factors, protease inhibitors, matrix proteins and neurotrophic factors to potentially correct the impaired corneal healing that is an underlying etiology of multiple severe ocular diseases. KALA is initially developing KPI-012 for the treatment of persistent corneal epithelial defect (PCED), a persistent, non-healing corneal defect or wound that is refractory to conventional treatments which, if left untreated, can lead to significant complications, including infection, corneal perforation/scarring and vision loss. PCED has an estimated incidence of approximately 100,000 patients in the U.S. and represents a sizeable market opportunity; there are currently no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescription products with a broad indication for all underlying etiologies of PCED. KALA is actively enrolling patients in the primary safety and efficacy portion of the CHASE (Corneal Healing After SEcretome therapy) Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating KPI-012 for the treatment of PCED and is targeting to announce topline data by year-end 2024.If the results are positive, and subject to discussion with regulatory authorities, KALA believes the CHASE Phase 2b trial could serve as the first of two pivotal trials required to support the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA. KALA is also evaluating the potential of KPI-012 for additional rare, front-of-the-eye diseases, such as Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency (LSCD) and other corneal diseases that threaten vision. LSCD is characterized by the loss or deficiency of limbal epithelial stem cells, which can result in recurrent epithelial breakdown, neovascularization, conjunctivalization, inflammation and other sequalae that can lead to loss of corneal clarity and vision impairment. Like PCED, LSCD represents a substantial market opportunity, with an estimated incidence of 100,000 patients in the U.S. KPI-014, KALA’s preclinical program to evaluate the utility of its MSC-S platform for inherited retinal degenerative diseases, contains neurotrophic factors, growth factors, anti-inflammatory or immune-modulatory factors and antioxidant inhibitors with the potential to protect and preserve retinal cell function. Secretomes have demonstrated a neuroprotective effect in both in vitro and in vivo models of retinal degeneration. KALA believes KPI-014 could offer a gene-agnostic approach for the treatment of rare inherited retinal diseases and has initiated preclinical studies to evaluate the utility of KPI-014 for conditions such as Retinitis Pigmentosa and Stargardt Disease. Corporate:In December 2023 and March 2024, KALA announced private placement financings with an institutional investor, priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules. Aggregate gross proceeds from the financings were approximately $2.0 million and $8.6 million, respectively. Financial Results: Cash Position: As of December 31, 2023, KALA had cash and cash equivalents of $50.9 million, compared to $56.1 million as of September 30, 2023. This decrease reflects cash used in operations and gross proceeds of $2.0 million received from KALA’s December 2023 private placement financing. Based on its current plans, KALA anticipates that its cash resources as of December 31, 2023, together with gross proceeds of $8.6 million received from its March 2024 private placement financing and anticipated funding under the CIRM award, will enable it to fund operations into the third quarter of 2025. Financial Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2023: SG&A Expenses: For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $4.6 million, compared to $5.8 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of KALA’s commercial portfolio to Alcon Inc. (Alcon) in July 2022.R&D Expenses: For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, research and development (R&D) expenses were $4.7 million, compared to $3.3 million for the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in KPI-012 development costs and employee-related costs.Loss on Fair Value Remeasurement of Deferred Purchase Consideration: There was no gain or loss on fair value remeasurement of deferred purchase consideration, in connection with the acquisition of Combangio, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 due to the settlement of the liability in March 2023. The loss on fair value remeasurement of deferred purchase consideration was $0.4 million for the same period in 2022.Loss on Fair Value Remeasurement of Contingent Consideration: For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the loss on fair value remeasurement of continent consideration, in connection with the Combangio acquisition, was $0.3 million, compared to a loss of $0.7 million for the same period in 2022.Operating Loss: For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, loss from operations was $9.6 million, compared to $10.3 million for the same period in 2022.Net Loss: For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, net loss was $8.6 million, or $3.18 per share, compared to a net loss of $12.8 million, or $7.97 per share, for the same period in 2022. The weighted average number of shares used to calculate net loss per share was 2.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, and 1.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Financial Results for the Full Year Ended December 31, 2023: Net Product Revenues: KALA did not recognize product revenues in the full year ended December 31, 2023 as a result of the sale of its commercial portfolio to Alcon in July 2022. For the full year ended December 31, 2022, Kala reported net product revenues of $3.9 million.Cost of Product Revenues: KALA did not record cost of product revenues in the full year ended December 31, 2023 as a result of the sale of its commercial portfolio to Alcon in July 2022. For the full year ended December 31, 2022, cost of product revenues was $2.6 million.SG&A Expenses: For the full year ended December 31, 2023, SG&A expenses were $20.6 million, compared to $65.0 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of KALA’s commercial portfolio to Alcon.R&D Expenses: For the full year ended December 31, 2023, R&D expenses were $18.6 million, compared to $17.7 million for the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase in KPI-012 development costs and employee-related costs, partially offset by a decrease in other research and development costs, which primarily included preclinical studies related to KALA’s former pipeline programs and facility related costs.(Gain) Loss on Fair Value Remeasurement of Deferred Purchase Consideration: For the full year ended December 31, 2023, the gain on fair value remeasurement of deferred purchase consideration, in connection with the acquisition of Combangio, was $0.2 million, compared to a loss of $0.6 million for the same period in 2022.Loss (Gain) on Fair Value Remeasurement of Contingent Consideration: For the full year ended December 31, 2023, the loss on fair value remeasurement of continent consideration, in connection with the Combangio acquisition, was $0.7 million, compared to a gain of $0.3 million for the same period in 2022.Operating Loss: For the full year ended December 31, 2023, loss from operations was $39.7 million, compared to $81.7 million for the same period in 2022.Loss on Extinguishment of Debt: For the full year ended December 31, 2023, KALA did not report a loss on extinguishment of debt, compared to a loss of $2.6 million in the same period in 2022 as a result of a partial prepayment of outstanding principal and related fees under its loan agreement with Oxford Finance LLC in connection with the closing of the sale of its commercial business to Alcon.Gain on Sale of Commercial Business: For the full year ended December 31, 2023, KALA did not report a gain on sale of commercial business, compared to a gain of $47.0 million for the same period in 2022 related to the sale of its commercial business to Alcon.Net Loss: For the full year ended December 31, 2023, net loss was $42.2 million, or $17.35 per share, compared to a net loss of $44.8 million, or $29.48 per share, for the same period in 2022. The weighted average number of shares used to calculate net loss per share was 2.4 million for the full year ended December 31, 2023, and 1.5 million for the full year ended December 31, 2022.

The national practice offers a hybrid model for advisors, combining flexibility with access to trust powers, credit, and planning through Fifth Third.","Fifth Third Wealth Advisors Surpasses $1 Billion in Assets Under Management Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Fifth Third Bank's independent Registered Investment Advisor, Fifth Third Wealth Advisors, surpasses $1 billion in assets under management in under 18 months. The national practice offers a hybrid model for advisors, combining flexibility with access to trust powers, credit, and planning through Fifth Third. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The achievement of Fifth Third Wealth Advisors in surpassing $1 billion in assets under management (AUM) within 18 months of its inception is a significant indicator of the firm's growth trajectory and operational success. This performance is particularly notable given the competitive landscape of the Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) market, where a minority of firms manage to exceed $750 million in AUM, as per the Datos Insights report. The rapid accumulation of AUM can be attributed to the firm's strategic positioning and the appeal of its hybrid model, which combines the flexibility of an independent platform with the resources of a larger institution.From a financial perspective, reaching this milestone can have positive implications for the parent company, Fifth Third Bancorp's stock valuation. Investors may view this as a sign of diversification and strengthening of the wealth management segment, which could lead to increased investor confidence and potentially an uptick in the stock price. However, the long-term sustainability of this growth depends on the firm's ability to maintain a high level of service, client retention and the capacity to continue attracting high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients. Market Research Analyst The expansion of Fifth Third Wealth Advisors is indicative of a broader trend in the financial services industry, where clients are increasingly seeking personalized investment solutions and comprehensive wealth management services. The firm's ability to operate nationally, unconstrained by the bank's regional footprint, suggests a strategic move to capture a larger market share across the country. This approach aligns with consumer preferences for tailored financial planning and the convenience of digital platforms that transcend geographical limitations.Moreover, the emphasis on complete back-office support and dedicated onboarding resources reflects an industry shift towards enhancing the client experience and operational efficiency. By streamlining the transition process for advisors, Fifth Third Wealth Advisors can potentially attract top talent from competitors, thereby strengthening its service offerings and competitive edge. The firm's model, which emphasizes the 'look and feel' of an independent boutique, may resonate well with clients who value a personalized approach but also seek the security and breadth of services offered by an established bank. Economist The dynamics of asset accumulation within Fifth Third Wealth Advisors offer insights into the broader economic context of wealth management. The firm's rapid growth in AUM during a period of economic uncertainty and market volatility reflects a potential shift in investor behavior, with a preference for wealth advisors that can provide a stable and diversified investment approach. The success of such firms can be seen as a microcosm of the larger economy, where capital tends to flow towards entities that can offer both innovation and stability.Furthermore, the hybrid model adopted by Fifth Third Wealth Advisors may be indicative of an evolving economic landscape where traditional banking services are increasingly integrated with investment advisory services to meet the complex financial needs of modern clients. This integration can create economies of scale and scope, potentially leading to cost efficiencies and enhanced revenue streams for the parent company. It's important to monitor whether this growth in AUM translates to improved bottom-line performance for Fifth Third Bancorp in the coming quarters. 03/29/2024 - 08:00 AM CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- In less than 18 months since announcing its launch, Fifth Third Bank’s independent Registered Investment Advisor, Fifth Third Wealth Advisors, has exceeded $1 billion in assets under management (AUM). “This milestone is a result of the dedication of our teams who bring the utmost in tailored solutions and service and their clients who place their trust in us,” said Eric Housman, president Fifth Third Wealth Advisors. Fifth Third Wealth Advisors currently has seven teams serving clients across the country regardless of geographic location. The national practice looks beyond the traditional Fifth Third regional boundaries and is not restricted by the Bank’s footprint when recruiting. According to Datos Insights U.S. Registered Investment Advisor Landscape Report, more than 5,000 RIAs serve clients in today’s wealth markets, but less than 20 percent have more than $750 million in AUM. Housman says that Fifth Third Wealth Advisors hybrid model offers advisors the ability to take advantage of Fifth Third Wealth Advisors’ flexible investment management platform while also providing access to trust powers, credit and planning through Fifth Third. Complete back-office support and dedicated onboarding resources provide advisors with a seamless transition. “We believe we offer the look, feel and nimbleness of an independent boutique backed by a top-performing regional bank.

(GALT) reported financial results for 2023, highlighting progress in their MASH cirrhosis program and the NAVIGATE Phase 2b/3 trial for belapectin. The company secured additional funding, extended cash runway through March 2025, and appointed new board members. The FDA approval of resmetirom for MASH patients with liver fibrosis was noted. The upcoming interim analysis of the NAVIGATE study in Q4 2024 is eagerly anticipated. Positive Galectin Therapeutics made significant progress in their MASH cirrhosis program in 2023. The NAVIGATE Phase 2b/3 trial for belapectin completed enrollment and randomization of 357 patients in 14 countries. Belapectin, a galectin-3 targeting drug, showed encouraging safety results in the trial. The company announced the addition of Khurram Jamil, M.D., to their team for his expertise in advanced liver disease. The FDA approval of resmetirom for MASH patients with liver fibrosis was highlighted. The company secured additional funding from Chairman Richard Uihlein, extending their cash runway through March 2025. Dr. Pol Boudes emphasized the potential of belapectin to offer new treatment options for MASH-associated liver cirrhosis. The company presented five posters at the Liver Meeting™ 2023, showcasing the safety profile and pharmacokinetics of belapectin. Benjamin S. Carson, Sr., M.D., was appointed as a new member of the Board of Directors. Financially, Galectin Therapeutics reported $25.7 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023. Research and development expenses increased to $32.1 million in 2023, primarily due to costs related to the NAVIGATE trial. General and administrative expenses decreased to $5.9 million in 2023, primarily due to non-cash stock-based compensation expense. The company reported a net loss applicable to common stockholders of $44.8 million for 2023, largely due to noncash interest expense and a noncash charge related to modification of common stock purchase warrants. Negative None. Biotech Industry Analyst The recent update from Galectin Therapeutics highlights several key aspects that are noteworthy for stakeholders. The completion of enrollment and randomization for the NAVIGATE Phase 2b/3 trial is a significant milestone, as it keeps the company on track for the top-line data readout in Q4 2024. This could potentially shift the competitive landscape in the treatment of MASH cirrhosis, particularly if belapectin proves to be effective in stopping the progression of portal hypertension.Moreover, the financial support from the Chairman, Richard Uihlein, through a $10 million credit facility, extends the company's operational runway through March 2025. This is a strong vote of confidence, providing the company with the necessary resources to continue its research and development without the immediate need for external financing, which could dilute existing shareholders' equity.The FDA approval of resmetirom for MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis brings attention to the field and may indirectly benefit Galectin Therapeutics by increasing awareness and potentially accelerating the adoption of new therapies upon successful trial outcomes. However, it's important to monitor the cash burn rate as R&D expenses have slightly increased year-over-year. The net loss widening is also a concern, driven by noncash charges, which investors should evaluate in the context of the company's long-term value proposition. Pharmaceutical Development Expert From a drug development perspective, Galectin Therapeutics' focus on belapectin for MASH cirrhosis addresses a critical unmet medical need. Liver transplantation as the only curative treatment for advanced liver disease underscores the importance of developing therapeutic alternatives. The safety profile of belapectin, as confirmed by the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board, is promising, considering safety is a major hurdle in drug development, especially in advanced-stage diseases.The NAVIGATE trial's design, targeting patients with advanced liver fibrosis progressing to cirrhosis and portal hypertension, is strategic. It targets a subset of patients with more severe disease progression where therapeutic options are limited. The Fast Track Designation by the FDA is indicative of the therapy's potential to address an urgent need and may lead to expedited review, benefiting the company's timeline for potential market entry.Understanding the pharmacokinetics of belapectin is crucial, as liver impairment can significantly alter drug metabolism. The fact that belapectin's pharmacokinetics are not affected by the degree of liver impairment could be a key differentiator in the treatment landscape, potentially simplifying dosing regimens and improving patient compliance. Healthcare Financial Analyst Assessing Galectin Therapeutics' financial health, the $25.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, along with the additional credit facilities totaling $30 million, provide a solid buffer for the company's operations. This financial backing is essential for a biotech firm in the clinical trial phase, where cash flow is typically negative. The slight increase in R&D expenses reflects the company's investment in its NAVIGATE trial, which is expected given the trial's progression into later stages.The decrease in general and administrative expenses, primarily due to lower non-cash stock-based compensation, suggests cost-saving measures and prudent financial management. However, the reported net loss increase, driven by noncash interest expense and a charge related to the modification of common stock purchase warrants, requires careful scrutiny. These noncash items can obscure the company's operational performance and stakeholders should focus on the underlying business and trial progress.Investors should also consider the potential dilutive effect of the credit facilities if they are converted into equity. The company's ability to manage its debt and navigate through the capital-intensive phase of clinical trials without excessively diluting shareholder value will be critical for long-term success. 03/29/2024 - 08:00 AM NORCROSS, Ga., March 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Galectin Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: GALT), the leading developer of therapeutics that target galectin proteins, today reported financial results and provided a business update for the year ended December 31, 2023. Joel Lewis, Chief Executive Officer and President of Galectin Therapeutics, said “We have been focused on advancing our Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH, formerly known as NASH) cirrhosis program. We completed enrollment and randomization for the NAVIGATE Phase 2b/3 trial in 2023, and belapectin has consistently shown an encouraging safety profile, which was determined by our independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board on multiple reviews. We are pleased with the recent addition of Khurram Jamil, M.D., to our team. Dr. Jamil’s extensive experience in advanced liver disease, specifically for late-stage cirrhotic patients, is a tremendous asset to our program. Echoing Dr. Boudes’ comments from early March, Dr. Jamil’s breadth of expertise in clinical development and regulatory interactions will be critical for the Company as we continue to execute the trial. We look forward to sharing the top-line interim analysis readout from NAVIGATE in Q4 2024. Finally, we are pleased to report that, once again, our Chairman, Mr. Richard Uihlein, has provided significant financing for the Company via an additional $10 million credit facility to the Company. This funding extends our cash runway through March 2025. On behalf of the Board and management I want to thank Mr. Uihlein for his confidence in our team and our program.” Pol Boudes, M.D., Chief Medical Officer added, “We were pleased by the very recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of resmetirom for the treatment of patients with MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis; this will bring renewed attention to the field. However, the population of patients in our NAVIGATE trial of belapectin have progressed beyond advanced liver fibrosis, to liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension and have the most pressing medical need. Currently, for them, the only curative treatment is liver transplantation, a process whose access is severely limited, highly complex and very costly. Our hope is that our belapectin MASH program, which has a Fast Track Designation, will for the first time offer a new medical treatment option for the increasing number of patients affected with MASH associated liver cirrhosis. We look forward to the upcoming interim analysis of the adaptive Phase 2b/3 NAVIGATE study which, we believe, has the potential to demonstrate belapectin’s ability to stop the progression of portal hypertension in cirrhotic patients and prevent the development of esophageal varices, which are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this population.” Q4 2023 Belapectin Program Highlights Belapectin is a complex carbohydrate drug that targets galectin-3, a critical protein in the pathogenesis of NASH and fibrosis. NASH Cirrhosis The NAVIGATE Phase 2b/3 trial (NCT04365868) evaluating the efficacy and safety of belapectin for the prevention of esophageal varices in MASH cirrhosis completed randomization of 357 patients in 14 countries on five continents. The fourth Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) meeting authorized the continuation of the trial as designed and without modifications.Upcoming milestone remains on track for top-line data readout from NAVIGATE interim analysis in Q4 2024. Presented five posters at the Liver Meeting™ 2023 of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) including the safety profile of belapectin and the fact that its pharmacokinetics properties are not affected by the degree of liver impairment. Corporate Updates Appointed Benjamin S. Carson, Sr., M.D. as a new member of the Board of Directors, following his service as a senior advisor to the Company since 2021. Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $25.7 million of cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, the Company has $20 million remaining available under a $60 million line of credit provided by its chairman to fund operations and a newly executed $10 million line of credit also provided by our chairman. The Company believes it has sufficient cash to fund currently planned operations and research and development activities through March 31, 2025. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $32.1 million compared with $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to costs related to our NAVIGATE clinical trial and other supportive activities. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $5.9 million, compared to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to non-cash stock-based compensation expense. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company reported a net loss applicable to common stockholders of $44.8 million, or ($0.74) per share, compared to a net loss applicable to common stockholders of $38.9 million, or ($0.65) per share for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase is largely due to an increase in noncash interest expense of $1.8 million and a noncash charge related to modification of common stock purchase warrants of $3.6 million. These results are included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, which has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and is available at www.sec.gov.

Financial Analyst The $9.8 million contract awarded to Palantir for the EMBM-J DS prototype adds a new revenue stream for the company and may positively influence investor sentiment. As Palantir is publicly traded, contracts of this nature can impact the company's stock price, both due to the immediate financial gain and the implications for future government contracts.Investors will likely monitor how this contract affects Palantir's financials in the upcoming quarters. The defense sector is known for its long-term contracts and stable revenue streams, which could provide Palantir with a predictable and growing income source, assuming the prototype leads to further development and deployment. However, investors should also be aware of the risks associated with government contracts, such as potential delays, changes in administration policies and rigorous performance requirements that can impact project timelines and costs.Moreover, the contract's value compared to Palantir's overall revenue should be considered. While $9.8 million is a substantial amount, it must be weighed against the company's total earnings to assess its relative significance. Investors should also contemplate the strategic importance of such contracts in positioning Palantir as a key player in defense technology, which could open doors to new markets and opportunities. Market Research Analyst The defense sector is increasingly reliant on sophisticated software solutions for operational planning and decision-making.

Net loss of $(14,922,228) for the year ended December 31, 2022. Cash used in operations was $4,369,885 for 2023. Financial Analyst The reported increase in net revenues for Guardion Health Sciences, with a significant 12% year-over-year growth of the Viactiv product line, indicates a robust performance in a competitive clinical nutrition space. The growth trajectory, particularly in the context of the broader market, suggests that the company has successfully capitalized on market opportunities or has effectively streamlined its operations to maximize revenue. The gross margin improvement by 3.1 percentage points, attributed to lower transportation costs and higher sales, reflects a positive trend towards operational efficiency and cost management. This is a key indicator for investors as it directly impacts profitability.However, the substantial decrease in total operating expenses due to non-recurring events, such as the write-off of intangible assets, can skew the perception of operational efficiency. It is important for stakeholders to differentiate between one-time savings and ongoing operational improvements. Additionally, the net income figure, which turned positive due to non-cash gains from changes in fair value of warrant derivative liabilities, should be approached with caution. Non-cash gains can be volatile and are not necessarily indicative of the company's operational performance. The basic and diluted net income per share figures reflect a significant improvement from the previous year's net loss, which could influence investor sentiment positively. Market Research Analyst The dominance of the Viactiv product line in Guardion's revenue stream, accounting for over 97% of total revenue, presents a risk concentration that investors should consider. While the product line's success is commendable, the company's reliance on a single product line could pose a strategic risk if market dynamics shift or if competitive pressures intensify. The planned sale of Activ Nutritional, LLC, which includes the Viactiv brand, for $17.2 million, is a significant strategic move that will reshape the company's future operations and revenue structure.This transaction, pending stockholder approval, is poised to transform Guardion's business model. The potential dissolution and liquidation of the company post-sale indicate a major pivot that could either lead to the distribution of net proceeds to shareholders or set the stage for a new strategic direction. Investors and analysts must closely monitor these developments, as they will have profound implications for the company's valuation and future prospects. The liquidation plan, if executed, will require careful evaluation of the company's remaining assets and liabilities to assess the potential return to shareholders. Legal Expert The conditionality of the sale of Activ Nutritional, LLC on stockholder approval, due to the sale constituting a substantial portion of the company's assets, is a critical legal and regulatory consideration. The requirement for stockholder approval is a governance mechanism designed to protect shareholder interests in significant corporate transactions. The preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC and the upcoming special meeting for stockholder voting demonstrate the company's adherence to regulatory requirements and corporate governance standards.Should the sale be approved, the company's intention to pursue a voluntary dissolution and liquidation introduces a complex legal process that necessitates rigorous compliance with corporate law. The Board of Directors' discretion to abandon or delay the liquidation plan in favor of a potentially more advantageous transaction underlines the dynamic nature of corporate strategy within the legal framework. Stockholders and potential investors should closely review the definitive proxy statement once available, to fully understand the implications of the proposed transactions and liquidation plan. 03/29/2024 - 06:15 AM Viactiv® Product Line Generated Net Revenues of Approximately $11.9 Million for the Year Ended December 31, 2023, an Increase of Approximately 12% as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2022 HOUSTON, TEXAS, March 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Guardion Health Sciences, Inc.

The sale of Activ, as contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, is conditioned upon receiving approval from the Company’s stockholders as the sale of Activ, which owns the Viactiv® brand and business and accounted for 97.2% and 96.3% of revenues during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, constitutes a sale of substantially all of the Company’s assets and revenue-generating operations. The transaction contemplated by the Purchase Agreement is the result of a broad review of strategic alternatives by the Company’s Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of the Company and the Company’s stockholders to approve this transaction. Potential Dissolution In the event that the Company’s stockholders approve the transaction and the transaction closes, the Company would be left with minimal operations. The Board of Directors has additionally determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to approve a voluntary dissolution and liquidation of the Company pursuant to a Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution, which, if approved, would authorize the Company to liquidate and dissolve in accordance with its terms, but such decision would be subject to the Company’s ability to abandon or delay the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution in the event that the Board of Directors determines that another transaction would be in the best interests of the Company’s stockholders. Assuming the approval of the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution by the Company’s stockholders, the decision as to whether or not to proceed with the dissolution and when to file the Certificate of Dissolution will be made by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion. On March 15, 2024, the Company filed a preliminary proxy statement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in order to solicit the approval of the Company’s stockholders in connection with the sale of Activ and the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution. The Company has set May 23, 2024 as the date of the special meeting (the “Special Meeting”) of its stockholders to vote on these transactions (and the other matters as will be described in the definitive proxy statement), and the close of business on April 5, 2024 as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Special Meeting.

Bilibili Inc.

The Company accepted all surrendered Notes for repurchase, providing cash payment to applicable holders.","Bilibili Inc. Announces Completion of the Repurchase Right Offer for 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags buyback Rhea-AI Summary Bilibili Inc. completes repurchase offer for 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026, with US$429,331,000 aggregate principal amount surrendered. The Company accepted all surrendered Notes for repurchase, providing cash payment to applicable holders. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of Bilibili's repurchase offer for its convertible notes is a significant financial move, indicating several underlying strategic and financial implications. Firstly, the repurchase of notes worth US$429,331,000 at face value suggests a substantial cash outflow from the company's reserves. This could imply a strategic decision to reduce debt and interest obligations, potentially signaling a shift towards a more conservative capital structure.Secondly, the market's response to this repurchase will be worth observing. If the repurchase is viewed positively, it could lead to an uptick in investor confidence, possibly impacting the company's stock performance on NASDAQ and HKEX. Conversely, concerns might arise regarding the company's liquidity position post-repurchase, which could affect investor sentiment. Moreover, the repurchase might also reflect management's view that the notes were undervalued, making it a cost-effective decision to reduce future dilution of equity.Lastly, the repurchase aligns with broader market trends where companies with strong balance sheets capitalize on opportunities to streamline liabilities, especially in a fluctuating interest rate environment. This can be an indicator of sound financial management, which is a positive sign for stakeholders. Market Research Analyst From a market research perspective, Bilibili's repurchase of its convertible senior notes can be seen as a maneuver to adjust its financial strategy in response to the evolving digital content market in China. The video community platform is likely recalibrating its capital allocation to better position itself against competitors and to invest in areas that promise higher returns, such as content creation, technology upgrades and user experience enhancements.Furthermore, this action might be interpreted as a response to market conditions and investor expectations. The repurchase indicates that Bilibili is actively managing its debt profile, which can be reassuring to investors concerned about over-leverage in the tech sector. This could potentially lead to a more favorable view of Bilibili's stock among investors who value prudent financial management and strategic capital deployment. Debt Market Analyst Examining the repurchase from a debt market perspective, Bilibili has effectively reduced its future interest expenses and potential equity dilution by repurchasing the convertible notes. Convertible notes are hybrid securities with debt and equity features and this repurchase indicates a reduction in the potential conversion of debt to equity, which is beneficial for current shareholders as it prevents their ownership from being diluted.Additionally, the repurchase could be a signal to the market about the company's internal valuation. If Bilibili's management believes that the stock is undervalued, repurchasing convertible notes can be a strategic move to avoid dilution at low equity prices. This action could also be a preemptive measure in anticipation of rising interest rates, which would make debt servicing more expensive in the future, thus aligning with a more defensive financial strategy. 03/29/2024 - 05:00 AM SHANGHAI, China, March 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bilibili Inc.

The company has repurchased a total of 1,753,178 ADSs amounting to $46.8 million under its share repurchase programs. The extended program, running until June 30, 2025, has $153.2 million of ordinary shares yet to be utilized. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst JinkoSolar's recent announcement of repurchasing American depositary shares (ADSs) sends a signal to the market about the company's self-assessment of its stock value. Share buybacks often suggest that a company believes its shares are undervalued and represent a good investment. From a financial perspective, this can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it can boost shareholder value by reducing the number of shares outstanding, potentially increasing earnings per share (EPS). On the other hand, it may indicate that the company does not have profitable reinvestment opportunities, which could be a concern for future growth.Investors should also consider the impact of buybacks on a company's balance sheet. JinkoSolar's use of cash for repurchases reduces its cash reserves, which could limit flexibility in operations or investments. However, if the repurchase is executed at a price truly below intrinsic value, it can be accretive to the valuation of remaining shares. The market's response to such news will vary, but generally, a well-timed buyback can be a positive sign to investors looking for capital appreciation. Market Research Analyst From a market research standpoint, JinkoSolar's repurchase program may reflect broader industry trends. The solar energy sector is highly competitive and capital intensive. Companies in this sector need to manage investor expectations and confidence carefully. By repurchasing shares, JinkoSolar could be attempting to stabilize its stock price in a volatile market, especially if the sector is experiencing turbulence due to policy changes or fluctuating demand. Additionally, investors should consider the timing of the buyback in relation to the company's operational performance and market conditions. If the repurchase coincides with strong financial results or favorable industry developments, it could further reinforce investor confidence. Conversely, if the sector is facing headwinds and the company's performance is lackluster, the buyback could be seen as a defensive move rather than a strategic one. Legal Expert Legally, share repurchase programs must adhere to specific regulations, such as Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to prevent market manipulation and insider trading. JinkoSolar's commitment to compliance with these rules is important for maintaining the integrity of the repurchase process. Investors should be assured that the company's insider trading policy and adherence to legal frameworks protect their interests and the fairness of the market.Furthermore, the structure of the buyback, whether through open-market transactions, privately negotiated deals, or block trades, can affect the market. Open-market transactions are the most transparent and are typically viewed favorably by investors. However, block trades or private deals can sometimes be executed at a discount or premium, which might not always align with the interests of all shareholders. 03/29/2024 - 06:13 AM SHANGRAO, China, March 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd.

U Power Limited Announces 1-for-100 Share Consolidation,2024-03-29T08:00:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,U Power  (UCAR) announces shareholder approval for a 1-for-100 reverse share split to regain Nasdaq compliance.,"U Power Limited Announces 1-for-100 Share Consolidation Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary U Power (UCAR) announces shareholder approval for a 1-for-100 reverse share split to regain Nasdaq compliance. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of U Power Limited's 1-for-100 reverse share split is a strategic financial maneuver designed to address compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement. This action typically indicates that a company's share price has been trading below the Nasdaq's stipulated threshold, which necessitates a corrective measure to boost the share price nominally and maintain its listing status.A reverse split reduces the number of shares outstanding, increasing the price per share correspondingly. However, it does not intrinsically change the company's market capitalization or its underlying value. Investors should note that while this may improve the optics of the stock price, it does not alter the company's fundamentals. Historically, reverse splits have been met with mixed reactions, as they can be perceived as a signal of distress, potentially leading to a short-term decline in investor confidence.For long-term stakeholders, the pivotal aspect to monitor will be the company's progression towards becoming a comprehensive EV battery power solution provider. Success in this transformation could counterbalance the negative connotations of a reverse split, but this is contingent on effective execution of business strategy and market reception. Market Research Analyst The EV battery power solutions sector in China is rapidly evolving, with significant advancements and increasing competition. U Power's vision to pivot into this space suggests an attempt to capture growth opportunities within an industry that is central to the global transition towards clean energy. The reverse share split could be seen as a short-term tactical move to stabilize the company's equity structure and appeal to a broader investor base.It's important for stakeholders to consider the competitive landscape U Power will be entering. Market dynamics, such as government policies, technological advancements and consumer adoption rates, will play a critical role in determining the company's future prospects. The ability of U Power to leverage its existing vehicle sourcing services into a more lucrative and high-growth battery power market could be a significant growth driver.However, investors should also be aware of the risks associated with such strategic shifts, including the intense capital requirements and potential execution risks. The success of the Share Consolidation in the short term and the strategic pivot in the long term, will be dependent on U Power's ability to differentiate itself and capitalize on the burgeoning EV market in China. 03/29/2024 - 04:00 AM SHANGHAI , March 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- U Power Limited (Nasdaq: UCAR) (the ""Company"" or ""U Power""), a vehicle sourcing services provider with a vision to becoming a comprehensive EV battery power solution provider in China, today announced that the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders on Monday, March 25, 2024, at which the shareholders approved the proposal for a 1-for-100 reverse share split of the Company's ordinary shares (the ""Share Consolidation""). No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the Share Consolidation and all fractional shares (after aggregating all fractional shares that would otherwise be received by a shareholder) resulting from the Share Consolidation will be rounded up to the whole number of shares. At the opening of trading on April 3rd, 2024, the Company's ordinary shares will begin trading on a post-Share Consolidation basis on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the same symbol, ""UCAR"", with a new CUSIP number of G9520U116. The Share Consolidation is being effectuated primarily to regain compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) related to the minimum bid price per share of the Company's ordinary shares. About U Power LimitedU Power Limited is a vehicle sourcing services provider, with a vision to becoming an EV market player primarily focused on its proprietary battery-swapping technology, or UOTTA technology, which is an intelligent modular battery-swapping technology designed to provide a comprehensive battery power solution for EVs.

The proposed combination may limit customer choice and entrench Keysight's leading position. VIAVI's Acquisition represents certain value in this scenario. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement of Keysight Technologies' acquisition of Spirent Communications has potential market implications that warrant a closer look. One key aspect to consider is the competitive landscape within the technology and communications sector. The acquisition could consolidate Keysight's market position, possibly leading to reduced competition. This, in turn, could affect pricing power and innovation dynamics within the industry.From an investor's perspective, the market's reaction to such news is often mixed. While the acquiring company might see a short-term dip in stock price due to the costs associated with the acquisition, the long-term benefits could include synergies and an expanded customer base. For Spirent shareholders, the acquisition price will be a critical factor, as it will determine the immediate financial benefit of the deal.Lastly, the regulatory scrutiny that such acquisitions attract is notable. Authorities may investigate to ensure that the acquisition does not breach antitrust laws, which could delay or even prevent the transaction. This presents a risk factor that shareholders of both companies must monitor closely. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial dimensions of the proposed acquisition, the market will be keenly observing the deal valuation and the method of payment, whether it's a cash deal or involves stock considerations. The premium that Keysight is willing to pay over Spirent's current market valuation will be scrutinized to assess the acquisition's accretiveness to earnings.Investors should also consider the impact on VIAVI's financial position, given that they are noting limited business overlap with Spirent. VIAVI's response to the acquisition may signal its own strategic positioning and potential future moves, which could include looking for other acquisition targets or strengthening its core competencies to compete more effectively.Furthermore, VIAVI's engagement of Qatalyst Partners LP and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC as financial advisors suggests a significant commitment to the process, indicating that they may be preparing a counteroffer or other strategic responses. Legal Expert The legal implications of such a high-profile acquisition are multifaceted. Firstly, the regulatory approvals required for the deal to proceed are a critical step. These may include antitrust clearance and foreign investment approvals, especially if the companies operate in multiple jurisdictions. The announcement mentions restrictions for overseas shareholders, which underlines the complexity of cross-border transactions and the need for compliance with various international securities laws.Another important aspect is the adherence to the Takeover Code, which governs the conduct of takeovers in the UK. The Scheme Document mentioned will contain important details regarding the terms of the acquisition and the rights of the shareholders. Shareholders of both companies should review these documents carefully to understand the legal ramifications of the transaction.The legal proceedings surrounding the deal will also be closely watched by the industry for precedent-setting outcomes, particularly in terms of how regulatory bodies view market consolidation in this sector. 03/29/2024 - 03:00 AM CHANDLER, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- VIAVI Solutions (“VIAVI”) (NASDAQ: VIAV) notes the announcement made by Keysight Technologies, Inc.

The Board thanks Mr. Pokrandt for his service.Shares for Debt TransactionThe Company intends to settle certain outstanding accounts payable in the aggregate amount of $105,000 (the ""Debt"") owing to an officer and director of the Company (the ""Consultant"") through the issuance of up to 2,333,333 common shares of the Company (the ""Settlement Shares"") at a deemed price of $0.045 per common share (the ""Shares for Debt Transaction"").The Debt was accrued pursuant to a Consulting Agreement (the ""Consulting Agreement"") entered into on July 1, 2016 between KORE and a company controlled by the Consultant of the Company. The Consulting Agreement provides for a monthly fee payable to the Consultant (the ""Service Fees"") of $17,500, inclusive of GST. The Shares for Debt Transaction is a non-arm's length transaction that will not result in a new control person of the Company being created.The issuance of the Settlement Shares to the Consultant constitutes a ""related party transaction"" as such term is defined by Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (""MI 61-101""). The issuance of Settlement Shares, as it relates to the Consultant, is exempt from the minority approval and formal valuation requirements of MI 61-101 pursuant to sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a), as neither the fair market value (as determined under MI 61-101) of the subject matter of, nor the fair market value of the consideration for, the transaction, insofar as it involves the Consultant, exceeds 25% of the Company's market capitalization (as determined under MI 61-101).According to the policies of the Exchange, the issuance of shares for debt by an issuer to a non-arm's length party in settlement of debt owed and arising from services provided by such non-arm's length party in excess of $5,000 per month, requires disinterested shareholder approval. KORE shareholders, excluding the Consultant, will be asked to approve the issuance of Settlement Shares to the Consultant at the next meeting of shareholders. The receipt of such approval will constitute disinterested shareholder approval. The issuance of Settlement Shares to the Consultant pursuant to the Shares for Debt Transaction requires acceptance by the TSX Venture Exchange. All Settlement Shares will be subject to a four-month and one- day hold period.The Company is proposing to issue the Settlement Shares to preserve cash to fund future operations.About the Imperial Gold ProjectKORE owns 100% of the Mesquite-Imperial-Picacho District which captures the entire 28-kilometer trend from the operating Mesquite mine (Equinox Gold) to the closed Picacho mine and including KORE's Imperial project. In the District, gold is hosted in local fault structures related to a series of regional faults connecting the known District deposits. Those three District deposits (Mesquite, Imperial and Picacho) were discovered in exposed outcrops and from placer workings. The rest of the District is covered by alluvium and has never been systematically explored.The Mesquite-Imperial-Picacho District centers on KORE's Imperial project. Imperial is a structurally controlled intermediate sulfidation epithermal gold deposit. The 100% oxide gold deposit is currently defined at 2.44 kilometer long and up to 0.75 kilometer wide and is open both along strike and downdip. It is hosted in a shallowly southwest dipping, amphibolite grade metamorphic rock suite along a west-northwest trending low-angle regional thrust fault system which controls the regional geometry of mineralization. East-west striking, post-mineralization normal faults control the property scale geometry of mineralization. Geophysical characterization of the deposit and regional controlling structures is an essential component of exploration for additional resources. Imperial has a mineral resource estimate and a positive preliminary economic assessment effective April 6, 2020 with the following highlights:US$ 343 million NPV5% post-tax with 44% IRR at US$ 1,450 per ounce gold US$ 590 million NPV5% at US$ 1,800 per ounce gold;Low capital intensity project with only US$ 143 million pre-production capital costAverage 146,000 ounces gold per year over 8 years for 1.2 million ounces total productionTechnically simple project: shallow open pit, run-of-mine heap leach with existing infrastructureValue enhancement through Mesquite-Imperial-Picacho District exploration and resource expansionThe Company's NI 43-101 compliant resource and preliminary economic assessment is titled ""Preliminary Economic Assessment - Technical Report Imperial Gold Project"" effective as of April 6, 2020 and revised and amended on June 10, 2021, prepared by Terre Lane and Todd Harvey of Global Resource Engineering and Glen Cole of SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. can be found under the Company's profile on SEDAR at www.sedarplus.ca and on the Company's website.About KORE's Long Valley Gold DepositThe Long Valley deposit is an intact low sulphidation epithermal Au-Ag deposit with a large 2.5 km by 2 km oxide footprint, hosted within a melange of fine to coarse volcanogenic sedimentary lithologies. Mineralization at Long Valley has developed due to a combination of deep-rooted fault structures and a resurgence of rhyolite within an active caldera. The Hilton Creek Fault structure transects and served as a fluid conduit for interaction with the underlying hydrothermal system, while the rhyolite resurgence caused brittle fracturing of sediments and created voids or traps for mineralization and gold deposition. The combination of these factors yields strongly altered kaolin and quartz-hematite zones that are the primary host for gold mineralization.The Hilton Creek Fault remains underexplored on-strike north and south and several parallel structures have been defined using geophysics, the eastern one hosting some of the current mineral resource and the western one being unexplored. Long Valley is therefore open to potential new oxide discoveries in all directions. More details on the deposit geology and exploration potential can be found in KORE's January 30, 2020 and March 24, 2020 news releases. About KORE's Long Valley Gold ProjectLong Valley is 100% owned epithermal gold and silver project located in Mono County, California. The large land package is district in scale and covers all deep-rooted fault structures of similar genesis to the Hilton Creek fault, the primary 'conduit' for the current Long Valley deposit.A total of 896 holes have been drilled on the Project, the majority being completed by reverse circulation with lesser core, rotary and air track. The current mineral resource estimate is 1,217,000 ounces of Indicated gold and 456,000 ounces of Inferred gold from 63.7 million tonnes of 0.58 grams per tonne and 22.0 million tonnes of 0.65 grams per tonne, respectively. The mineral resource consists of oxide, transition and sulphides. The estimate was prepared by Neil Prenn, P.E. of Mine Development Associates with an effective date of September 15, 2020. A Preliminary Economic Assessment for a shallow, low-strip heap leach Au-Ag project was filed October 27, 2020 with the following highlights:US $273 million NPV5% post-tax with IRR of 48% at US$ 1,600 per ounce gold;US$ 395 million NPV5% at spot US$ 1,900 per ounce gold;102,000 ounces gold per year over 7 years mine life;Technically simple: shallow open pit, heap leach with nearby infrastructure;Unmodelled silver potential from metallurgical test-work; andShallow oxide and sulphide feeder exploration potential to further enhance project.More information is available in the technical report filed on SEDAR at www.sedarplus.ca and on KORE's website at www.koremining.com.
