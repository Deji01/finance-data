Motley Fool,Is It Too Late to Buy Palantir Stock?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-buy-palantir-stock-200500069.html,Shares have soared over the last year following the smashing success of its latest artificial intelligence (AI) software.,"One of the rising stars in the artificial intelligence (AI) arena is Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR). For many years, Palantir sold three data-analytics software suites: Foundry, Gotham, and Apollo.Last April, Palantir released its fourth flagship product: the Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). Its launch has been nothing short of a home run, helping the company quickly expand beyond its previous focus on government contracts.This newfound growth, coupled with euphoria surrounding AI, caused shares to rise 167% last year. With the stock up another 24% so far in 2024, investors might be thinking they've missed out on Palantir.I see things differently. Let's break down why Palantir is still a lucrative opportunity for long-term investors.Don't call it a comebackFor much of its history, Palantir relied on large, lumpy government deals from the U.S. military and its Western allies before it went public in late 2020. This caused some skeptics to label Palantir more of a consulting operation or government contractor as opposed to a true software-as-a-service (SaaS) business. Moreover, as growth in the government business began to decelerate in 2022, the stock cratered nearly 65%.With shares reaching an all-time low of just $6 at the end of 2022, things were looking murky for the enterprise software developer. But Palantir demonstrated an impressive level of resiliency last year, essentially reinventing itself amid the AI revolution.Following the release of AIP last year, the company began hosting immersive seminars called ""boot camps"" as part of its marketing campaign. The idea was for clients to demo Palantir's products in real time. By showing prospective customers AIP's capabilities, management created a large new pipeline of business.Over the last year, the company has hosted over 850 boot camps, leading to a surge in new customers as AI use cases explode.In 2023, Palantir's total customer count increased 35% year over year to 497. But more importantly, customer growth from the private sector rose 44% to 375. In the fourth quarter alone, revenue from U.S. non-government customers increased 70%.These results silenced the bears and skeptics. Palantir proved it has legitimate AI chops, and customers across a variety of sectors are lining up to try out AIP.Image source: Getty Images.The journey is just getting startedWhile the customer demand is an encouraging sign, Palantir is growing more than just revenue. Unlike many other high-growth SaaS businesses, it's consistently profitable. The company has generated positive net income for five consecutive quarters, and adjusted free cash flow rose more than threefold last year.Story continuesAnother interesting development is its relationship with Oracle, which competes heavily in cloud computing against the likes of Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon. Palantir is working to migrate data workloads from its software platforms onto Oracle's cloud.I see this as a win-win for both companies. For Palantir in particular, the partnership should serve as a unique source of lead generation for both public- and private-sector business.A premium valuation well worth itOne word of caution for investors is that Palantir stock has gotten a bit pricey. At a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 22.5, it's the most expensive stock among other enterprise SaaS peers such as Snowflake, Datadog, ServiceNow, and MongoDB.PLTR PS Ratio ChartAs the chart above illustrates, Palantir's valuation ballooned in February following the company's fourth-quarter earnings report.Zooming out and looking at the bigger picture will help investors as they consider adding Palantir to their portfolio. Despite the surge in share price, the stock is still down more than 40% from its all-time high.Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives recently placed a $35 price target on Palantir stock, implying over 60% upside from current levels.The more important idea is that investors should remain patient as the AI narrative plays out. They should prepare to hold for the long term and keep an eye out for new developments from Palantir.The unprecedented demand for AIP coupled with the company's strong financial position and its strategic relationships makes me think it's in a good position to emerge as a leader in AI in the long run. The company has proved so far it can fend off big tech, and I don't see that dynamic changing. Given the recent dip in Palantir stock, now could be the right opportunity to scoop up some shares.Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Where Will Super Micro Computer's Soaring Stock Be in 2026?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-super-micro-computers-soaring-200200927.html,"The stock just received a big price target bump, suggesting it could surge impressively over the next few years.","Shares of Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) have set the market on fire in the past year with outstanding gains of 795%, and one analyst believes this red-hot rally is set to continue.Supermicro's business is booming thanks to the rapidly growing demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) server solutions, and Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah predicts Supermicro's red-hot growth is here to stay. He's upgraded his price target on the stock from $600 to $1,500. The updated price target is 54% higher than where the stock trades as of this writing.Let's look at the reasons why the analyst bumped his price target 2.5 times higher, and consider whether Supermicro could indeed hit that mark by 2026 per Loop Capital's prediction.Tremendous growth lies ahead for SupermicroSupermicro's fiscal 2024 (ending June 30, 2024) revenue is expected to land at $14.5 billion based on the midpoint of management's guidance. That would be slightly more than double the company's fiscal 2023 revenue of $7.1 billion. Consensus estimates are calling for Supermicro's earnings to nearly double from $11.81 to $22.10 per share over the same period.However, as the following chart indicates, analysts are projecting Supermicro's pace of growth to slow down over the next two fiscal years (through fiscal 2026).SMCI Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year ChartBaruah, however, believes Supermicro could generate between $30 billion and $40 billion of revenue in 2026. Its earnings, on the other hand, could jump to a range of $50 to $60 per share. In other words, the Loop Capital analyst expects both revenue and earnings to at least double over the next two or so years.Those numbers are far higher than what the consensus estimates indicate. However, a closer look at the AI server market that Supermicro serves and the moves it's making in this space indicates it could indeed hit Baruah's numbers.And comments from management on Supermicro's January earnings call support Baruah's target. According to CEO Charles Liang:Today, our production utilization rate is about 65% across our U.S.A, Netherlands, and Taiwan facilities, and they are quickly filling. To address this immediate capacity challenge, we are adding two new production facilities and warehouses near our Silicon Valley headquarter, which will be operating in a few months. The new Malaysia facility will focus on expanding our building blocks with lower costs and increased volume, while [the] other new facility will support our annual revenue capacity above $25 billion.So, management already has plans for its top line to exceed $25 billion. Additionally, the company's focus on further enhancing its manufacturing capacity by investing in more infrastructure could set the stage for additional growth.Story continuesInvestors can expect tremendous upsideLoop Capital's $1,500 price target is based on the firm's baseline earnings per share forecast of $50 in fiscal 2026 and a forward earnings multiple of 30. This forward earnings multiple is in line with the Nasdaq 100 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks).However, AI stocks tend to command a premium valuation thanks to their rapid growth, so there's a chance Supermicro could deliver even stronger upside than what the firm is forecasting. For instance, if Supermicro's top line increases to $30 billion in fiscal 2026, but the stock maintains its current price-to-sales multiple of 6, its market cap would jump to $180 billion, more than triple its current level.It's also worth noting Supermicro's price-to-sales ratio is lower than the tech sector's average of 7. Investors, therefore, could still be getting a good deal on this AI stock.Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Is Snowflake Stock a Buy Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/snowflake-stock-buy-now-200000921.html,The company might have the right person in place to lead the company into a new era of growth.,"In 2020, data company Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) went public in one of the hottest initial public offerings (IPO) of all time. The IPO priced at $120 per share, but the stock finished its first day of trading above $250 per share.Now, approaching four years later, Snowflake stock is down about 40% from where it closed on day one. In short, it's been a complete dud for early investors.I wouldn't blame Snowflake entirely for the poor performance of its stock because the business has excelled. Here's how its financials have looked in each of its four complete fiscal years since its IPO.MetricFiscal 2021Fiscal 2022Fiscal 2023Fiscal 2024Product revenue growth120%106%70%38%Free cash flow margin(14%)7%24%28%Source: Snowflake's press releases. Table by author.Snowflake's revenue is nearly five times higher now than when it went public, and it generates strong free cash flow. The stock fell during this time, nonetheless, because it was priced irrationally high at its peak.Indeed, at one point, Snowflake stock traded at over 100 times trailing sales. That sometimes happens with small companies, but Snowflake was already a large business at the time. In short, it's hard to find upside when shares are that expensive. That said, the chart below shows it's fallen to an all-time low valuation.SNOW PS Ratio ChartWith the stock still underperforming and valuation at a new low, it's time to consider whether Snowflake stock is finally a buy.Two reasons I'm still not sold on SnowflakeTo be clear, a price-to-sales ratio of 17 doesn't put Snowflake stock in value territory -- it's still trading at a premium price. The high price tag isn't a deal-breaker in isolation, but it highlights the need for robust growth for an investment in this company to pay off.That growth isn't on tap in Snowflake's fiscal 2025 (which started in February). The company only guided for 22% product revenue growth in the current year. And there are two reasons this gives me pause.Snowflake is being celebrated as a top stock for the artificial-intelligence (AI) trend. After all, the company's products and services deal with immense amounts of enterprise data, and AI makes use of large amounts of data. Therefore, Snowflake would appear to be a natural beneficiary of growth in this space.However, the AI trend is already rolling, so there should be some noticeable benefit to Snowflake already. But the company just guided for its slowest year of growth ever. That's the first reason I'm still not sold on Snowflake right now.Story continuesThe other reason I'm not sold on Snowflake stock is related to management's long-term outlook. Since it went public, the company has been targeting $10 billion in product revenue for fiscal 2029. However, its guidance for fiscal 2025 puts it below the pace it needs to reach this goal on time.Management appears to have hinted at the possibility of falling short of its fiscal 2029 target too. Snowflake's investor presentations have always included a reference to the fiscal 2029 outlook, but its most recent quarterly presentation quietly left this detail out.Not all doom and gloomSnowflake is a huge business, yet it's still growing at a double-digit rate. That's worth noting. The company isn't falling apart -- it's just not growing as fast as I believe it needs to in order to justify its price.Moreover, Snowflake's slowing growth rate could improve. I noted my concern that the company doesn't seem to be benefiting from AI yet, but perhaps that's the real reason leadership has seen changes. Frank Slootman took Snowflake public, but he announced his retirement in February and handed the reins to Sridhar Ramaswamy, who was notably in charge of the company's AI efforts.In other words, this CEO transition could be tacit recognition that Snowflake has a golden opportunity with AI, and Ramaswamy is taking over to ensure the company can capitalize on it.For his part, Ramaswamy seems convinced of Snowflake's potential as he just bought $5 million of the stock.Ramaswamy's appointment and stock purchase don't make Snowflake stock a buy on their own. But it's enough reason to keep an eye on this business because future results could improve and put my concerns to rest.Should you invest $1,000 in Snowflake right now?Before you buy stock in Snowflake, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Snowflake wasn’t one of them.

Auditors Are On to ThemMagnificent Seven Earnings Arrive With Stocks at Critical MomentElon Wants His Money BackXi Orders China’s Biggest Military Reorganization Since 2015The pullback was triggered in part by comments from Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams, who said there’s no rush to cut interest rates and it’s possible that economic data could even warrant an increase if inflation persists.The realization that the interest rate pivot had yet to arrive comes as the US economy continues its strong performance, causing financial conditions to loosen in recent months. As a result, the market isn’t yet showing signals that the central bank has restricted policy enough to begin easing, said Bill Zox, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management.The return of the higher-for-longer mantra is a headache for insurance companies and pension plans which, flush with cash, sent demand for bonds soaring this year as they tried to lock in yields ahead of the anticipated cuts. Corporates responded by issuing more than $1 trillion of notes globally so far this year, the second-highest level since at least 2013. Now, however, investors are yanking money from high-yield funds and flows into shorter duration high-grade products have slowed dramatically.Click here to listen to a podcast about how Morgan Stanley thinks credit could be in trouble if the Fed hikes.For US investment-grade debt, spreads are only edging wider, and demand for many new issues is still strong. But signs of growing caution are clear in credit markets: Spreads on US junk debt have pushed wider after the rise in negative sentiment, and high-yield is poised for the biggest monthly loss on a total return basis since September 2022. It’s a marked reversal of the sense of complacency that earlier this month saw the global perception of risks from credit reach the lowest levels since February of last year, according to a Bank of America Corp. survey of fund managers.Adding to the problems for policymakers, retaliatory strikes between Israel and Iran have sent oil prices higher, which could fuel inflation. The tensions in the Middle East also risk dampening demand for credit as investors seek havens like Treasuries instead.Story continuesInvestor PushbackOne area where investors are pushing back is the leveraged loan market. While it continues to see demand, money managers have successfully pushed back on terms sought by issuers in recent days.Rocket Software Inc. was forced to drop plans for a portable debt structure in recent days after feedback from money managers, according to people with knowledge of the matter. If the trend continues, it’s a potential positive for private credit providers, who have faced renewed competition in recent months from banks.In Europe, it’s a different story. Traders are pricing around 80 basis points of cuts from the European Central Bank this year and officials have stressed they still plan to cut first in June and don’t need to wait for the Fed.Still, the volatility this week means more than 70% of bond deals issued in Europe were in the red as of Friday morning in London, hurting retail investors, data compiled by Bloomberg News show.Back in the US, some junk firms risk being hurt by the tightening in monetary policy.“If those cuts get pushed out after the election, it could be a challenge for some of the lower-quality floating-rate issuers” who need to refinance, Meghan Robson, head of US credit strategy at BNP Paribas, said in an April 10 interview with the Credit Edge podcast. “That risk is not priced in yet but is something that could come into the debate as we get closer to the June and July timeline.”Week in ReviewBanks including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co. and Goldman Sachs sold bonds this week in the US high-grade bond market, following their release of first-quarter results.Wells Fargo & Co. sold $4.25 billion on Monday, and C$1.25 billion ($900 million) of debt in the Canadian bond market on Tuesday, while Morgan Stanley sold $8 billion of bonds Wednesday, after it posted higher-than-expected quarterly revenue.Banks are fighting back after private lenders have grabbed ever larger pieces of the lucrative business of financing leveraged buyouts: They’re serving as matchmakers on transactions between smaller companies looking for loans and private lenders eager to provide financing.Wall Street’s securitization engine is revving up with issuance touching record levels as borrowers rush to secure funding before any credit market disruptions caused by the US general election.The US leveraged loan market, as yet unruffled by the shift to a higher-for-longer view on interest rates, may soon join in the pain being felt in other asset classes.Fading hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon cut rates are prompting US banks to re-evaluate the cost of their preferred stocks, potentially sparking a rush of deals for the crucial source of capital.Banks are increasingly gathering orders for riskier high-yield bond and leveraged loan sales in private before formally announcing them to the broader market, in an effort to ensure deals find enough demand in difficult markets.Blackstone Inc. led a roughly $2 billion financing package to Park Place Technologies to refinance the company’s debt and fund a payout to its private equity owners.As climate change exacerbates droughts and wildfires, and utilities often take the blame for starting them, their assets are increasingly at risk.Riverside Co. is exploring strategic options including a sale of its direct lending arm, Riverside Credit Solutions.Asset manager Columbia Threadneedle Investments thinks that now is a good time to grab a bigger piece of the collateralized loan obligation market, recently saying it plans to expand its CLO business and become a regular issuer.Alternative asset manager Sculptor Capital Management has launched a platform to invest in the riskiest tranches of CLOs, which will count its new owner Rithm Capital Corp. as a key investor.Library services companies Baker & Taylor and Media Source Inc. have held talks to combine and have approached direct lenders about financing for the potential deal.Bayview Asset Management, a money manager, is in the process of marketing a complex bond that was created to help SoFi Technologies Inc., an online bank and lender, hedge part of its student loan book.Vietnamese companies are cutting back on issuing new bonds as yields rise and the government heightens scrutiny on capital markets, a development that’s stirring refinancing risk concerns.On the MoveToronto-Dominion Bank’s head of private debt has left the firm amid a restructuring at the Canadian lender that includes cutting 3% of jobs globally.Siemens AG has hired Milan Senicic as executive director to lead its corporate and leverage finance business in Australia.ING appointed Gautam Saxena as head of corporate finance for the Asia Pacific region.--With assistance from Michael Msika, Jill R.

Motley Fool,"Down 37% From Its All-Time High, Is This Growth Stock a Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/down-37-time-high-growth-171700660.html,Planet Fitness is growing revenue and posting consistent earnings.,"Due to the temporary closures of gyms and other public spaces enacted to slow the spread of COVID-19, Planet Fitness (NYSE: PLNT) took a big financial hit during the early stages of the pandemic. But shares eventually recovered before hitting a new peak in November 2021.It's been a difficult ride for shareholders in this profitable and scalable business since then, though. As of April 16, this fitness growth stock is down 37% from that all-time high. Could that make Planet Fitness a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity?Looking at the fundamentalsPlanet Fitness had a strong 2023. It grew its revenue by 14.4% to $1.1 billion, a new record for the company. This was driven by an 8.7% growth in same-store sales, as well as the opening of 165 net new locations. Planet Fitness also added 1.7 million new members, bringing its total customer count to 18.7 million as of year's end.All of these key metrics point to a business that has bounced back nicely from the depths of the coronavirus pandemic. Consumer behavior has normalized, which has been a clear benefit. Its executives remain optimistic about the long term. They think the company can one day have 5,000 gyms open in the U.S. That would be a near doubling of its current footprint. And if Planet Fitness gets remotely close to that target, its sales and earnings should be significantly higher than they are today.Understanding competitive advantagesIt's extremely difficult to find lasting success in the fitness industry, which has a long history of short-lived fads. It doesn't help that these companies must bank on their customers sticking to their workout routines -- or at least paying the fees that would allow them to.Planet Fitness has figured out how to build a sustainable business model. Part of its success comes from operating a franchise system. Of the company's 2,575 locations, less than 10% are actually owned by Planet Fitness. The rest are owned by private investors who put up their own capital and pay recurring fees to the business.""The best business is a royalty on the growth of others,"" famous investor Warren Buffett once said. Planet Fitness fits that description. It expands on the backs of the capital investments that franchisees make. This helps drive the continued generation of free cash flow, of which Planet Fitness reported almost $200 million last year.The company's scale and brand are also important competitive strengths. Planet Fitness has a national reach that makes it easier to attract new members. It has the financial resources to acquire favorable locations to open new gyms. And it can spend more on marketing, all while keeping its lowest-priced membership tier at just $10 per month. That's hard to beat.Story continuesA worthy investment candidatePlanet Fitness possesses attributes that make it a quality business, particularly in the fitness industry. It's growing customers, revenue, and profit, and appears to have a long runway for growth ahead.To buy the stock, investors are being asked by the market to pay a forward P/E ratio of 24.4. That represents a premium to the 21.3 multiple of the S&P 500. But some investors might believe that the valuation is justified.To be clear, I do think that Planet Fitness makes for a worthy investment candidate today for long-term investors. But I don't believe we can call it a once-in-a-generation opportunity. If its forward P/E ratio dropped substantially to say, 15, then maybe it would fit into that rare category. At that point, it would look like a no-brainer stock to buy.Nonetheless, investors should still take a closer look at the stock for their own portfolios.Should you invest $1,000 in Planet Fitness right now?Before you buy stock in Planet Fitness, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Planet Fitness wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"2 Warren Buffett Stocks You Can Buy With This Year's Average $3,011 Tax Refund",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-warren-buffett-stocks-buy-160000213.html,Investors can find Buffett-owned stocks without leaving the consumer sector.,"Another tax day has come and gone, and refunds are always a focus of this tax season. Through early April, the average amount refunded to taxpayers was $3,011.This involves both bad news and good news for investors. The bad news is that those taxpayers made an interest-free loan to the government. However, the sting of that realization may be helped by the good news that taxpayers finally have their money back, likely giving them some cash to invest.Those who want to find Warren Buffett investments (or at least stocks from his team at Berkshire Hathaway) might consider some of the consumer stocks he holds right now. Let's look at two below.AmazonAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a stock that Buffett recognized late. He and his team waited until the first quarter of 2019 to invest in the e-commerce giant even though it has been trading since 1997. The optionality of its many businesses and the stock's tremendous growth has been a boon to Berkshire's portfolio.Amazon began as an e-commerce company, and online sales remain its largest revenue source. But it also supports fast-growing businesses such as subscriptions (Amazon Prime), online seller services, and online advertising. Investors should pay particular attention to its cloud computing operation. That segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), drives the majority of the company's operating income.Today, the company has a massive $1.9 trillion market value. In 2023, Amazon claimed a staggering $575 billion in net sales, a 12% yearly increase. Since operating expenses grew at a slower 7% rate over that time, profits rose significantly. Amazon was able to earn $30 billion in net income in 2023, a huge improvement over its $3 billion loss in the prior year.Amazon's shares are trading at $184 per share, so investors receiving the average tax refund can afford a few shares despite an 80% increase in the stock price.From a valuation perspective, Amazon's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 63 may sound rich, but it's notably lower than the five-year average of 91. Additionally, its forward P/E ratio of 44 speaks to the 45% earnings growth expected for the retail giant, a pace that could keep it a market-beating holding for shareholders.Floor & DecorRegional to national growth stories propelled stocks like Home Depot in the previous century, and that trend appears set to bolster a smaller Home Depot competitor called Floor & Decor Holdings (NYSE: FND). Buffett's team began buying the company in the third quarter of 2021. It specializes in hard flooring and decor, offering more selection than a Home Depot and using its bulk purchasing power to offer low prices to consumers.Story continuesAs of the end of 2023, Floor & Decor had expanded to 36 states, and its store count of 221 grew by 31 during that fiscal year. Also, it plans to open between 30 and 35 new stores in fiscal 2024, bringing it closer to a long-term goal of operating 500 locations.Admittedly, the sluggish economy affected its near-term performance. During fiscal 2023, net sales of $4.4 billion rose 4%, well below the double-digit increases of past years. Moreover, rising selling and store operating expenses took a toll, and net income of $246 million dropped 18% from the previous fiscal year.That placed upward pressure on the P/E ratio, which currently stands at 49. While this is above the five-year average of 40, it's not at unusual levels for the stock.

Motley Fool,"My Top 3 ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks to Buy Right Now",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-3-magnificent-seven-stocks-160000347.html,The advertising market is set to boom in 2024.,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" group of stocks has been a powerhouse in the market since the start of 2023, with all of them beating the S&P 500. It includes:Microsoft AppleNvidiaAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)TeslaThis collection has had a strong run, but not every one of them is a strong buy right now, in my opinion. Nearly every one of these companies has artificial intelligence (AI) aspirations, but my reason for buying three of the seven stocks is centered around a much older practice: Advertising.Advertising is a massive industryIf advertising is my reason to buy some of these stocks, then Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are the ones I'm talking about. This trio generates a massive amount of revenue each quarter from advertising.CompanyQ4 Advertising RevenueAlphabet $65.5 BillionMeta Platforms $38.7 BillionAmazon$14.7 BillionData sources: Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Amazon.While Alphabet and Meta are leaders in this category, some may be surprised that Amazon is also heavily involved in the ad marketplace. In fact, advertising services were Amazon's fastest-growing segment in the fourth quarter, increasing 27% year over year.Meta's ad division also put up solid growth figures in Q4, with its ad revenue rising 24% year over year. Alphabet was the laggard of the trio, but this also makes sense due to its sheer size. It delivered an 11% growth rate in Q4.So why are these growth rates a big deal? Well, if you rewind the clock to this time last year, these rates weren't nearly as impressive (besides Amazon). The ad market struggled in early 2023 due to fears of a recession. When businesses are concerned about a potential economic downfall, they save on whatever expenses they can. One of the easiest places to trim is ad budgets, which negatively affects businesses like Meta and Alphabet, which are highly concentrated in this industry.However, the fear of imminent recession has subsided, so businesses are happy to begin increasing their ad budgets. This is why ad-heavy companies like Meta and Alphabet have seen success recently.Amazon is a different story, as their ad revenue growth never dipped like Alphabet's or Meta's. This is likely due to the relatively young age of Amazon's ad business and that it's still working on building out its capabilities. When this segment matures, it will likely display the cyclical trends that the other two do, but it's in full growth mode right now.With the ad market improving each quarter, all three companies stand to benefit, making them excellent buys.Story continuesThe stocks are still attractive buysIn addition to a recovering ad market, these three are some of the most attractively priced Magnificent Seven stocks. My valuation metric of choice for Alphabet and Meta is the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, as the trailing 12 months used in the more common trailing P/E ratio still includes some quarters where the ad business was down. If you use this metric, it's clear these two are fairly priced.GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) ChartWe can use Amazon's forward P/E (it's at 44), but that isn't fair to the business as portions of the company (like its international commerce division) aren't profitable and aren't expected to become fully profitable for some time. As a result, I'll use the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio to value Amazon.AMZN PS Ratio ChartFrom this perspective, Amazon still has a way to go before being valued at the same levels as 2018 through 2021. So, investors can confidently buy the stock, knowing that it still isn't back to historical valuation norms.Advertising is a great business to be in right now, which makes this trio a fantastic pick in 2024.Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"1 Unstoppable Stock That's Skyrocketed Nearly 1,400% Since the Start of 2023: Don't Buy and Hold Until You Know These 3 Risks",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-unstoppable-stock-thats-skyrocketed-155600509.html,Investors should still proceed with caution when it comes to this company.,"Since the start of 2023, shares of Carvana (NYSE: CVNA) have skyrocketed nearly 1,400% (as of April 16). During that same time, the Nasdaq Composite index is up 52%. It would probably take you some time to find a better-performing stock in recent times. Even Nvidia, the best ""Magnificent Seven"" stock since the start of last year, has climbed only 500%.This puts Carvana in a league of its own. But before you rush to buy this unstoppable stock, here are three risks you need to know about.Risky financial situationOne key reason why the market has fallen in love again with Carvana is that the business has shown progress toward cleaning up its financials. There were very real worries that the company was about to tip into bankruptcy, particularly after it spent $2.2 billion to acquire ADESA in May 2022. Management struck a deal with creditors to extend the maturities of its debt, lowering interest payments in the process.Carvana's total long-term debt balance of $5.6 billion (as of Dec. 31) was down from $6.8 billion just 12 months ago. That little bit of improvement likely resulted in renewed investor optimism.However, this company is still extremely risky from a financial perspective. Carvana's debt burden amounts to 39% of its market cap and more than half of its 2023 revenue. Perhaps even more alarming, 41% of the company's fourth-quarter gross profit went toward making interest payments. In a world where interest rates might be higher for longer, this creates a reason to worry.I'll also point to Carvana's lack of consistent profitability. With management investing aggressively behind national expansion and marketing, the bottom line hasn't been a priority. That adds more risk.Sensitive to macro factorsAnother important risk that investors can't ignore is that Carvana's business model relies on favorable macroeconomic conditions to prosper. When interest rates are low, cars are more affordable because monthly payments for consumers are lower. This is the environment Carvana rode for most of its existence. Carvana sold 24% fewer cars in 2023 than it did in 2022. Growth could be difficult to achieve if rates remain elevated, at least at a higher level than they've been for most of the past decade.Industry-specific factors, like used car prices and supply trends, also profoundly impact this company, and these are outside Carvana's control.Just because a business is overly exposed to macro and industry conditions doesn't always mean it's a risky situation. But based on Carvana's unfavorable financial condition, which I mentioned in the previous section, it's in a tough spot. Story continuesCompetitive forcesIn 2023, there were 35.9 million used car transactions in the U.S. Based on the number of units Carvana sold last year, it currently has less than 1% market share. This business is tiny in the grand scheme of things.There is clearly a massive opportunity present to push more used car sales online. It's a better experience for the customer. And for dealers, not having to operate brick-and-mortar locations can cut costs.Consequently, Carvana will continue to face stiff competition as it tries to gain market share. Carmax, AutoNation, and CarGurus are scaled rivals. There are also the unlimited number of dealerships scattered across the U.S. that are building out their own e-commerce presence. This will make things difficult for Carvana to achieve consistent growth and profitability.Carvana shares have been on a fantastic run. But I still think the business is extremely risky. While I'm still not a buyer of the stock, I can understand why some daring investors would consider adding the company to their portfolios as it sits way below its peak price.Should you invest $1,000 in Carvana right now?Before you buy stock in Carvana, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Carvana wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Tesla's Stock Price Just Plunged. Is Now the Time to Invest?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/teslas-stock-price-just-plunged-154100161.html,Tesla's having a rough year. Is it a buying opportunity or a warning sign?,"After soaring through 2023, Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) fortunes have suddenly changed in 2024.The EV stock was the worst-performing stock on the S&P 500 in the first quarter, plagued by a disappointing earnings report, price cuts in the EV industry, and broader concerns about high interest rates weighing on demand.The stock continued to slide in April as Tesla reported weak first-quarter deliveries, which were down 9% from the previous year, and it made the surprising move of laying off 10% of its workforce later in the month. The stock is down 11% in the past week, hovering near a 52-week low at a time when the S&P 500 is near an all-time high.So is it a good idea to buy Tesla on the dip? Let's take a look at where the company is today before we answer that question.Image source: Tesla.Tesla in transitionEver since Tesla stock skyrocketed in 2020 when it became profitable, the stock has had a much higher valuation than its traditional automaker peers. Even after the recent sell-off, Tesla is valued at $500 billion, making it one of the most valuable stocks in the country, and several times more valuable than peers like General Motors and Ford.However, Tesla is now facing challenges on multiple fronts. Vehicle deliveries were not only down in the first quarter, but also significantly short of its production, indicating weakening demand. While the company hasn't yet reported first-quarter earnings, profits are likely to be down significantly as prices have fallen due to increasing competition in the EV industry.Additionally, media reports said that the company is putting the development of its mass market-priced Model 2 on pause so it can it focus on its robotaxi and full self-driving technology.Tesla is also laying off more than 10% of its workforce, another indicator that demand is underwhelming, and two key executives involved with battery and vehicle manufacturing said they were leaving the company.Down 37% this year, is Tesla a buy?With EV sales struggling amid increasing competition, weakening demand, and high interest rates, Tesla is pivoting its hopes to its robotaxi and full self-driving technology.CEO Elon Musk said the company would unveil its robotaxi on August 8, but the company is also notorious for delaying its promises and product releases, and Musk has a pattern of using such promises when it's struggling.Tesla's robotaxi has the potential to be a game-changer for the company, but even if Tesla does launch the robotaxi in August, regulation is likely to make a full roll-out challenging.Story continuesAutonomous vehicles were predicted to go mainstream several years ago, but that didn't happen due to regulatory pressure, safety concerns, and media scrutiny, among other issues.However, Tesla isn't the only company working on self-driving technology. Alphabet's Waymo has racked up millions of miles of driverless transportation and is now actively ferrying passengers in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix. General Motors' Cruise was also active in San Francisco until regulators recently pulled it off the road after too many infractions. Other tech and auto companies have also made significant progress in autonomous driving as well.Tesla is still priced at a premium even though the core growth story, selling EVs, appears to be on hold, at least as long as deliveries and prices both keep falling.A recovery in the stock will take a return to solid growth in EV sales and profits or a blowout presentation of the robotaxi, as autonomy is already priced into the stock.In the current economic environment and with the broader headwinds in the electric vehicle sector, that looks more likely to be a losing bet. Tesla stock is best avoided at this point.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
