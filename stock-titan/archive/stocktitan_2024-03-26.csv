Reduction in quarterly average paying users in Q4 2023. Lower gross margin in Q4 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Market Research Analyst The performance of DouYu International Holdings Limited in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 reveals a contraction in several key financial metrics, including a significant decrease in total net revenues and gross profit, as well as a shift from net income to net loss when compared year-over-year. This downturn reflects broader challenges within the live streaming and eSports sectors, particularly in the context of a soft macroeconomic environment that has affected consumer spending and advertising budgets.From a market research perspective, the decline in mobile MAUs and paying users indicates a potential saturation in the market or a loss of competitive edge against other platforms. The increase in advertising and other revenues, however, suggests a successful pivot towards diversifying revenue streams, which could be a strategic move to mitigate the impact of declining livestreaming revenues. The company's focus on cost optimization and strategic initiatives aimed at long-term sustainability are positive signs for potential recovery and growth. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial health of DouYu, the reported net loss in Q4 2023 alongside the adjusted net income for the full year suggests a complex financial picture. The company's ability to turn a full-year net profit despite a quarterly loss may indicate effective cost management and the ability to navigate short-term headwinds. The substantial increase in advertising and other revenues is a positive indicator of the company's adaptability and potential new income sources. However, the decrease in livestreaming revenues and the drop in quarterly paying users raise concerns about the company's core business model and its scalability in the current economic climate.Investors should consider the company's long-term strategy and the viability of its growth initiatives in the face of these challenges. The share repurchase program could be seen as a signal of confidence from the management in the company's valuation, but it also raises questions about the best use of capital given the current financial results. eSports Industry Analyst The financial results of DouYu provide insights into the broader eSports and live streaming industry in China. The acquisition of the LOL World Championship tournament rights is a strategic content investment that could enhance the platform's appeal, but it comes at a time when the company is facing a decrease in both revenue and user base. This move may reflect an attempt to strengthen DouYu's position in the competitive eSports market, where exclusive content can be a significant draw for users.However, the overall decline in user engagement, as seen in the decrease of average mobile MAUs and paying users, suggests that the industry may be experiencing broader challenges, such as market saturation or shifts in consumer behavior. The company's response, focusing on product innovation and content upgrades, will be critical in maintaining relevance and competitiveness in this rapidly evolving sector. 03/26/2024 - 04:00 AM WUHAN, China, March 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- DouYu International Holdings Limited (""DouYu"" or the ""Company"") (Nasdaq: DOYU), a leading game-centric live streaming platform in China and a pioneer in the eSports value chain, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year ended December 31, 2023.

Livestreaming revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased by 36.1% to RMB1,020.8 million (US$143.8 million) from RMB1,596.7 million in the same period of 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to the soft macroeconomic environment and reduced revenue-generating promotions during the quarter, leading to a decrease in the number of quarterly average paying users. Advertising and other revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by 226.5% to RMB275.2 million (US$38.8 million) from RMB84.3 million in the same period of 2022.

Revenue sharing fees and content costs in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased by 30.3% to RMB885.3 million (US$124.7 million) from RMB1,271.1 million in the same period of 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in sharing fees aligned with decreased livestreaming revenues, as well as a decline in content costs resulting from improved cost management in self-produced content and streamer payments. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in copyright costs due to the acquisition of the LOL World Championship tournament. Bandwidth costs in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased by 27.4% to RMB100.5 million (US$14.2 million) from RMB138.4 million in the same period of 2022.

Gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2023 was RMB126.2 million (US$17.8 million), compared with RMB186.1 million in the same period of 2022.

Sales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased by 32.2% to RMB84.0 million (US$11.8 million) from RMB123.9 million in the same period of 2022.

Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased by 26.7% to RMB59.1 million (US$8.3 million) from RMB80.6 million in the same period of 2022. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in staff-related expenses. General and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by 45.0% to RMB80.0 million (US$11.3 million) from RMB55.2 million in the same period of 2022.

For more information about NewHydrogen, please visit https://newhydrogen.com/. About NewHydrogen, Inc. NewHydrogen is developing ThermoLoop™ – a breakthrough technology that uses water and heat rather than electricity to produce the world’s lowest cost green hydrogen. Hydrogen is the cleanest and most abundant element in the universe, and we can’t live without it. Hydrogen is the key ingredient in making fertilizers needed to grow food for the world. It is also used for transportation, refining oil and making steel, glass, pharmaceuticals and more. Nearly all the hydrogen today is made from hydrocarbons like coal, oil, and natural gas, which are dirty and limited resources. Water, on the other hand, is an infinite and renewable worldwide resource. Currently, the most common method of making green hydrogen is to split water into oxygen and hydrogen with an electrolyzer using green electricity produced from solar or wind. However, green electricity is and always will be very expensive. It currently accounts for 73% of the cost of green hydrogen. By using heat directly, we can skip the expensive process of making electricity, and fundamentally lower the cost of green hydrogen. Inexpensive heat can be obtained from concentrated solar, geothermal, nuclear reactors and industrial waste heat for use in our novel low-cost thermochemical water splitting process. Working with a world class research team at UC Santa Barbara, our goal is to help usher in the green hydrogen economy that Goldman Sachs estimated to have a future market value of $12 trillion.

The approval is based on positive Phase 3 trial results showing efficacy in chronic ITP patients. VYVGART has a well-tolerated safety profile and demonstrated a rapid onset of effect, offering a precision intervention for ITP patients. Positive Regulatory approval in Japan for VYVGART to treat primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) Phase 3 ADVANCE-IV trial results led to approval based on efficacy in chronic ITP patients VYVGART showed a rapid onset of effect and a well-tolerated safety profile Global approval in Japan signifies a significant milestone for argenx SE and VYVGART Precision intervention targeting the underlying disease biology of ITP Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The approval of VYVGART in Japan for the treatment of primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) marks a significant development in the field of autoimmune disease management. ITP is a chronic condition characterized by a dangerously low platelet count, leading to excessive bruising, bleeding and other serious health issues. The traditional approach to treating ITP often involves a degree of guesswork, with physicians cycling through various therapies to find an effective treatment. The introduction of VYVGART, which operates by reducing circulating autoantibodies, represents a more targeted strategy that aligns with the precision medicine paradigm.From a research perspective, the positive outcome of the Phase 3 ADVANCE-IV trial, which showed a 51% response rate on the IWG score, is particularly notable. This response rate is significant as it suggests a substantial proportion of patients treated with VYVGART experienced improved platelet counts, which is a direct measure of therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, the fact that the drug was well-tolerated across a diverse patient population, including those with extensive prior treatments, positions VYVGART as a potentially valuable addition to the existing ITP treatment landscape. Healthcare Economist The approval of VYVGART for ITP in Japan is not only a medical milestone but also an event with economic implications. The Japanese healthcare market is known for its rigorous regulatory standards and an approval here often paves the way for subsequent approvals in other countries, potentially leading to a broadened market presence for argenx SE. For stakeholders, this expansion in indications could mean a significant increase in the patient pool eligible for treatment with VYVGART, thus potentially increasing the drug's revenue stream.In terms of cost-effectiveness, precision therapies like VYVGART can lead to better resource allocation in healthcare by reducing the need for trial-and-error treatment approaches, which are often time-consuming and expensive. However, the high cost of novel biologics is a concern that payers and health systems must consider. The long-term economic impact will depend on the drug's pricing strategy, reimbursement policies and the overall reduction in healthcare utilization if the therapy proves to reduce the frequency and severity of ITP-related complications. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The pharmaceutical landscape for autoimmune diseases is highly competitive, with numerous companies vying for market share. The approval of VYVGART for ITP in Japan represents a strategic advantage for argenx SE, as it is the first global approval for the drug in this indication. This first-mover advantage could be instrumental in establishing the company as a leader in the treatment of IgG-mediated diseases.Investors should monitor the uptake of VYVGART in Japan closely, as it may serve as an indicator of the drug's potential performance in other markets. Furthermore, the successful transition of patients from the ADVANCE trial to the ADVANCE+ open-label extension study suggests strong patient and clinician interest in VYVGART, which could translate into robust market adoption. Analysts will be looking at prescription trends, market penetration rates and competitive responses to assess the impact on argenx SE's financial performance and stock valuation. 03/26/2024 - 02:00 AM VYVGART® now approved in Japan for both generalized myasthenia gravis and primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) Regulatory decision in Japan represents first global approval for VYVGART in ITP March 26, 2024 7:00 AM CET Amsterdam, the Netherlands – argenx SE (Euronext & Nasdaq: ARGX), a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases, today announced that Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) approved VYVGART (efgartigimod alfa) for intravenous (IV) use in adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). “argenx is on a mission to deliver transformative medicines for people living with severe autoimmune disease,” said Tim Van Hauwermeiren, Chief Executive Officer of argenx. “We have always believed VYVGART has the potential to treat many IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases, and now patients in Japan, who have been waiting for a new treatment option, have one for ITP. My sincere thanks to all of those who contributed to today’s milestone approval in Japan – it takes true collaboration to bring real innovation for the millions of patients around the world living with rare autoimmune disease. And our work has only just begun.” “ITP is a severe, debilitating autoimmune disease, and ITP patients typically experience a significantly lower quality of life,” said Luc Truyen, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer of argenx. “Physicians now treat ITP via a trial-and-error approach – or by cycling through current therapies. By reducing circulating autoantibodies, VYVGART is uniquely designed to serve as a precision intervention that targets the underlying disease biology of ITP. We are grateful to all of those who contributed to advancing our understanding of the disease so that we could bring VYVGART to patients in Japan.” The approval of VYVGART is based on results from the global Phase 3 ADVANCE-IV trial, which were published in the September 2023 issue of The Lancet. ADVANCE successfully met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that a higher proportion of chronic ITP patients receiving VYVGART achieved a sustained platelet count response compared to placebo. VYVGART demonstrated rapid onset of effect in chronic and persistent ITP patients, as well as a 51% response rate on the International Working Group (IWG) score, which is a measure developed by the world’s leading experts on ITP and highly relevant to clinical care. Primary endpoint responders were observed across patient types regardless of age, disease severity, time since diagnosis, prior ITP treatment or background medication. VYVGART was well-tolerated in this 24-week study and the observed safety and tolerability profile was consistent with previous clinical trials. Phase 3 ADVANCE Trial The ADVANCE trial enrolled 131 adult patients with chronic and persistent ITP. Patients were heavily pretreated and 67% of patients had received three or more prior ITP therapies, including 59% who had prior thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RAs) experience, 34% with prior rituximab experience and 37% with a history of splenectomy. Patients were insufficiently controlled at baseline with mean platelet counts of 17x109/L across all patients. Of patients who completed the full ADVANCE study, 94% (63/67) of VYVGART-treated patients and 97% (38/39) of placebo patients continued to the ADVANCE+ open-label extension study.

About Immune Thrombocytopenia Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder where immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies destroy platelets and reduce platelet production, which can lead to an increased risk of excessive bleeding and bruising. In severe cases, frequent bleeding events can cause anemia or even brain hemorrhage in rare cases. ITP is also associated with debilitating fatigue and significant impacts on mental health, including anxiety, fear and depression. Many ITP patients are inadequately controlled on current therapies so there remains a significant unmet need for additional treatment options. About VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) VYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), resulting in the reduction of circulating IgG autoantibodies. It is the first approved FcRn blocker in the United States, EU and China for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti- acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs). VYVGART is being studied in adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and other IgG autoantibody-mediated diseases. VYVGART has been approved for adults with ITP only in Japan at this time.

KKR will hold a majority stake in the partnership, marking its first investment program in the South Korean rental housing sector. Positive None. Negative None. Real Estate Investment Analyst The partnership between Weave Living and KKR to invest in Seoul's rental housing market is a strategic move that taps into the growing demand for quality urban living spaces. Seoul is a densely populated city where the real estate market is competitive and the demand for rental housing is on the rise due to socio-economic shifts such as increased urbanization, a growing number of single-person households and rising property prices that outpace the average individual's purchasing power.The decision to focus on approximately 1,200 units is a targeted approach that allows for a controlled scale-up, mitigating the risks associated with oversupply. Moreover, the diversification of Weave's consumer brands caters to different market segments, which could enhance tenant retention rates and reduce vacancy cycles. The long-term vision to institutionalize the rental housing market could introduce more structured investment opportunities, potentially leading to increased foreign investment and a more stable rental market. However, the success of this venture will hinge on the partners' ability to execute their strategy amidst regulatory challenges and market competition. Market Analyst KKR's entry into South Korea's rental housing sector signifies a broader trend of investment firms diversifying their portfolios by including real estate assets that offer steady cash flows and potential for capital appreciation. This move is aligned with global investment patterns where rental housing is becoming an attractive asset class due to its resilience during economic downturns and lower correlation with volatile stock markets.For investors, this strategic partnership represents a commitment to the Asia Pacific region, which could signal confidence in the region's growth prospects. The collaboration between a global firm like KKR and a specialized operator like Weave Living could create synergies that enhance the value of the assets. This could result in improved financial performance for the involved entities and could positively influence their stock valuations. However, investors must monitor the execution of the strategy and market conditions, as shifts in consumer preferences or economic downturns could impact the anticipated returns. Urban Development Expert The strategic partnership's focus on Seoul's urban rental market recognizes the city's ongoing transformation and the need for modern, well-managed living spaces. The introduction of Weave's global management standards is likely to raise the bar for rental housing quality, which could have a ripple effect on urban development and living standards. By providing a variety of housing options, the venture is poised to address the diverse needs of the city's population, including young professionals and expatriates.However, urban development is complex and involves considerations like city planning regulations, infrastructure support and community integration. The success of this venture will depend on its ability to align with Seoul's urban development goals and to contribute positively to the city's landscape. The venture's commitment to scale over time suggests a cautious approach to growth, which is prudent in the dynamic and often unpredictable urban development sector. 03/26/2024 - 03:08 AM The venture will target to build an initial portfolio of c.1,200 units primarily in Seoul SEOUL, South Korea--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- WEAVE LIVING (“Weave”), Asia Pacific’s preeminent living sector specialist, and KKR, a leading global investment firm, today announced the establishment of a strategic partnership to invest in rental housing assets in South Korea, with a focus on Seoul.

The unit will have a capacity of 230,000 tons per year and process local waste from the circular economy. TotalEnergies aims to produce 1.5 million tons of SAF annually by 2030. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The agreement between TotalEnergies and SINOPEC to develop a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production unit represents a strategic move within the energy sector, particularly in the context of the global push towards carbon neutrality. This collaboration is indicative of the increasing importance of alternative energy sources in the traditional energy companies' portfolios. With the aviation industry under pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, the demand for SAF is expected to rise significantly.From an energy sector perspective, the planned production capacity of 230,000 tons of SAF per year is a substantial figure, considering the relatively nascent stage of the SAF market. This venture could potentially position both companies as front-runners in the SAF industry in Asia, which is a significant growth opportunity given the size of the Asian aviation market. Moreover, SINOPEC's proprietary SAF production technology, SRJET, might provide a competitive advantage in terms of production efficiency or cost-effectiveness, which are critical factors in the scalability of SAF.For investors, the long-term implications of this agreement could be favorable, as it aligns with global sustainability trends and regulatory shifts towards greener fuels. However, the capital expenditure and operational costs associated with developing new technologies and production facilities must be weighed against the potential market demand and regulatory incentives for SAF. It is also essential to monitor the progress of this collaboration to gauge its operational success and impact on the companies' financial performance. Environmental Policy Expert The partnership between TotalEnergies and SINOPEC aligns with broader environmental policy goals, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation sector. The production of SAF using waste and residues from the circular economy is a step towards more sustainable practices in energy production. It not only addresses the carbon emission challenges but also contributes to waste reduction and resource efficiency.From a policy standpoint, such initiatives are likely to receive support from governments, especially in regions with stringent carbon reduction targets. The development of SAF production capabilities in China is particularly noteworthy, as China is one of the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases and has ambitious climate goals. The success of this venture could serve as a model for other companies and industries, potentially influencing environmental policies and regulations.Investors should be aware that the environmental policy landscape can directly impact the viability and profitability of projects like SAF production. Positive regulatory changes, such as carbon pricing or subsidies for low-carbon technologies, could enhance the return on investment, while any negative policy shifts could pose risks. Monitoring policy trends is therefore important for understanding the long-term prospects of investments in sustainable energy projects. Aviation Industry Analyst The development of a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production unit by TotalEnergies and SINOPEC is a significant event for the aviation industry, which is actively seeking solutions to reduce its environmental impact. With air travel expected to recover and grow post-pandemic, the demand for aviation fuel will increase, putting additional pressure on the industry to find sustainable alternatives to traditional jet fuel.SAF has the potential to significantly cut CO2 emissions from aircraft, a critical factor as airlines face regulatory and public pressure to operate more sustainably. The aviation industry's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint, such as through the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), underscores the importance of developing SAF. The collaboration's focus on producing SAF from local waste and circular economy residues is particularly relevant, as it leverages local resources and contributes to a more sustainable fuel supply chain.For stakeholders in the aviation sector, including airlines and airports, the increased availability of SAF in China could lead to improved sustainability metrics and potentially reduced carbon offset costs. However, the adoption rate of SAF will depend on its cost competitiveness with conventional jet fuel and the pace at which the necessary infrastructure and regulations are put in place. Investors should monitor the uptake of SAF by airlines, as well as any developments in aviation industry standards that could influence the demand for SAF. 03/26/2024 - 03:15 AM PARIS & BEIJING--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News: TotalEnergies (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE) and China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (“SINOPEC”) have signed a Heads of Agreement (HoA) to jointly develop a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production unit at a SINOPEC's refinery in China. The planned unit, jointly owned by SINOPEC and TotalEnergies, will have the capacity to produce 230,000 tons of SAF per year, and will process local waste or residues from the circular economy (cooking oils and animal fats). SINOPEC has developed its own SAF production technology, called SRJET. TotalEnergies, already one of Europe's leading SAF producers, will bring its experience and expertise in the technical, operational and distribution fields. Yongsheng Ma, SINOPEC Group Chairman, said: “This milestone collaboration with TotalEnergies is in line with our strategy in the development of low carbon solutions for China and the world. SINOPEC is committed to providing green and low-carbon energy solutions while improving quality and efficiency of its asset portfolio.” Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TotalEnergies, stated: “We are very pleased to collaborate with SINOPEC, a major player in the global refining industry, to produce sustainable aviation fuels and structure a SAF production chain in China. The development of sustainable aviation fuels is at the heart of our company's transition strategy, as we strive to meet the aviation industry's demand to reduce its carbon footprint.

""Those same selectors also emphasized asset management partners who help them meet the shifting needs of heterogeneous investors through development of appealing investment strategies."" The independent study measures and ranks asset managers' relative brand attractiveness based on fund selector perceptions: taking into account 10 brand attributes to reveal the top U.S. and global brands. This is the latest study from Broadridge's Data and Analytics business and highlights the depth and breadth of the firm's global market insights. Top-10 U.S. Asset Management Brands Rank Fund Group Change 1 Vanguard +1 2 BlackRock -1 3 Capital Group 0 4 JPMorgan AM +1 5 Fidelity -1 6 PIMCO 0 7 Goldman Sachs +3 8 Franklin Templeton 0 9 Dimensional Fund Advisors 0 10 First Trust +4 Key insights While no-one new breaches the top five, the major firms jostle for position, with Vanguard usurping BlackRock's position atop the ranking. Vanguard was able to maintain first place in the three highest-ranked brand attributes and duked it out with BlackRock across the entire brand spectrum. In fact, the two firms split first place in eight of the 10 categories, with Vanguard winning by points total. There was plenty of competition elsewhere in the top ten, as JPMorgan took fourth, pushing Fidelity down to fifth, as First Trust took T. Rowe Price's 10th place position. Homegrown groups continue to dominate the U.S. – in fact they significantly strengthened their domestic dominance. French firm Natixis IM remains the highest-ranked non-US brand but fell from 22nd place to 32nd. 2023 was a gangbuster year in U.S. markets. Domestic stocks were up 24%, international equities up 19.5%, and a well-timed fourth-quarter rally saved bonds from an unprecedented third consecutive year of losses as they returned 5.5%. Last year's uncertain climate saw investors cling to stability and resulted in stasis in the rankings. This year, investor confidence returned, and firms sought new ways of differentiating themselves from their competitors. Valued attributes While U.S. fund selectors were less risk-averse than in 2022, they still prized 'Solidity' above all other attributes – resulting in a consolidation of strength for the domestic giants. 'Stability of investment management team' was also a top-five attribute, as fund selectors desire stability that extends to the teams that they work with. 'Appealing investment strategy' ranked third in the list of desirable attributes. Investors favor asset managers who can offer a clear and effective strategy for balancing risk and returns. A well-defined strategy can distinguish a firm from competitors in the eyes of clients with specific investment approaches or needs. Expertise is also highly valued in the U.S. – advisers want to shift the burden of research onto asset managers. Clients preferred approachable, knowledgeable fund specialists who can provide specialized, detailed analysis in a timely manner. Additional findings from this year's study include: US fund flows are dominated by the myriad decisions made by intermediaries on behalf of individual clients to buy or sell a fund. To help facilitate this, the industry innovates new products (model portfolios, interval funds, separately managed accounts, actively managed ETFs, etc.). Strong equities and fragile bonds gave asset managers the opportunity to target clients with communications advising them on how to navigate this changing landscape. Firms that were able to do so saw their brands burnished.A rush of advisers seeking out private equity and private debt opportunities helped alternatives manager Blackstone Group jump 57 spots to land in 21st position.Fund selectors highly value clear and detailed marketing materials. In a crowded marketplace, successful managers offer fund selectors a wide range of new investment products. Effective communication of the value of these product strategies is as important to fund selector decision-making as offering a wide range of products from which to choose.A webinar is scheduled for March 27, 2024 at 2 PM GMT / 10 AM ET / 10 PM HKT to reveal the top asset management brands in each region. Registration is available to all at https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/4510770/F63F5F36B873DEE0FC7D364394198FBE and is now open. About the research The Broadridge Fund Brand 50 report is an annual study monitoring the influence of brand on third-party fund selection. The study is based on intensive interviews in Europe, APAC, and the US with more than 1,200 of the most significant fund selectors and gatekeepers – the key decision makers who choose which funds and groups are added to a distributor's buy list. Interviewees name their top-three suppliers across the following 10 brand attributes. - Solidity- Client-oriented thinking- Appealing investment strategy- Thinks and acts globally- Stability of investment management team- Experts in what they do- Knowledge and understanding of the markets- Innovation/Adaptation to market change- Keeping best informed- Social Responsibility/Sustainability These answers, as well as commentary from other preference questions, are collated using statistical analysis and transformed into a 'Total Brand Score', on which groups are ranked.

Negative None. 03/26/2024 - 03:15 AM Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - March 26, 2024) - Defence Therapeutics Inc. (CSE: DTC) (OTCQB: DTCFF) (FSE: DTC) (""Defence"" or the ""Company""), a Canadian biotechnology company developing novel immune-oncology therapeutics and drug delivery technologies, is pleased to announce the successful testing of a second-generation anti-cancer vaccine, called ARM-002TM, using its lead anti-cancer molecule AccuTOX®. When tested as a therapeutic vaccine in a melanoma cancer model, ARM-002TM leads to an 80% complete response when combined with the anti-PD-1 immune-checkpoint inhibitor.Compared to current anti-cancer strategies, vaccination can stimulate specific immune responses capable of potentially curing established tumors. In addition, developed immune cells can lead to a long-lasting memory response capable of further protecting the patient from subsequent cancer relapses. Using mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) as a vaccination platform; Defence has previously shown that it is possible to pharmacologically reprogram these immune-suppressive cells into potent antigen presenting cells using its Accum® derivative called A1 (ARMTM vaccine). Although the ARMTM vaccine can effectively present antigens to responding T cells, the large amount of antigen preparation required to generate the cellular vaccine might represent challenges in the clinic. Defence elected to test its lead AccuTOX® molecule to engineer a second-generation anti-cancer vaccine as the latter was shown to directly enhance antigen presentation in cancer cells if delivered intratumorally at lower doses.""AccuTOX® is an amazing molecule! AccuTOX® has the capacity to trigger cancer cell death when used as a direct cancer injectable, and AccuTOX®, the same molecule, converts MSCs into potent antigen presenting cells capable of priming potent anti-tumoral responses using a 10-fold lower antigen preparation,"" says Mr. Plouffe, Chief Executive Officer of Defence Therapeutics.The ARM-002TM vaccine was tested in vivo in the context of melanoma. The vaccine elicited an impressive anti-tumoral response, which prompt the team to widen its scope of application by further testing it on ""hard to treat"" ovarian and pancreatic cancers. The Defence team are conducting additional studies in parallel to decipher the exact mode of action of AccuTOX® in reprograming MSCs while studying the mechanistic behind the ARM-002TM potency using different in vivo studies. Once these studies finalized and the ""Dry Run"" manufacturing of the ARM-002TM vaccine completed, a request to obtain clearance for a Phase I trial targeting a basket of solid tumors will be initiated.Data Bridge Market Research analyses that the solid tumours market was valued at $209.61-billion (U.S.) in 2021 and is expected to reach $901.27-billion (U.S.) by 2029, registering a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 20 per cent during the forecast period of 2022 to 2029.https://www.databridgemarketresearch.com/reports/global-solid-tumors-market#:~:text=Data%20Bridge%20Market%20Research%20analyses,period%20of%202022%20to%202029.About Defence:Defence Therapeutics is a publicly-traded biotechnology company working on engineering the next generation vaccines and ADC products using its proprietary platform.

The system received CE certification, offering improved usability and anatomical fit for femur fractures treatment.","Stryker launches Gamma4 Hip Fracture Nailing System in Europe Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Stryker (SYK) launches Gamma4 Hip Fracture Nailing System in European markets, enhancing surgical workflows with advanced features. The system received CE certification, offering improved usability and anatomical fit for femur fractures treatment. Positive None. Negative None. Orthopedic Surgeon The introduction of Stryker's Gamma4 Hip Fracture Nailing System presents a significant advancement in the field of orthopedic surgery. The system's design, which is informed by a substantial SOMA database, implies a tailored approach to intramedullary nailing that could potentially enhance the anatomical fit for patients. A chamfered distal tip and a shorter proximal body are indicative of a nuanced understanding of bone morphology, which could translate into improved surgical outcomes and reduced recovery times for patients suffering from hip and femur fractures.Furthermore, the length-dependent radius of curvature for longer nails may suggest a more natural alignment within the femur, potentially reducing stress on the bone and the implant. The Precision Pin™, with its increased resistance to pull out and reduced skiving, points towards a reduced risk of intraoperative complications, which is a critical factor in successful patient outcomes. As an orthopedic surgeon, the integration of these features could signify a stride in our ability to provide more reliable and patient-specific care. Medical Device Market Analyst The release of Stryker's Gamma4 system in the European market is a strategic move that could strengthen the company's position in the global orthopedic device industry. The CE certification indicates that the product meets the European Union's safety, health and environmental protection requirements, which is an essential step for market penetration. Stryker's established presence in North America and Japan, with over 25,000 cases already utilizing the Gamma system, demonstrates a proven track record that may facilitate adoption in Europe.From a market perspective, the aging population in Europe is likely to increase the prevalence of osteoporotic and osteopenic bone conditions, leading to a higher demand for hip and femur fracture treatments. The Gamma4 system's improved features, such as the redefined nail design and integrated instrument platform, cater to this growing market by offering enhanced usability and streamlined surgical procedures. This could result in cost savings for healthcare providers and improved turnover rates for surgeries, potentially impacting Stryker's sales and market share positively. 03/26/2024 - 03:10 AM New system streamlines workflows and enhances usability AMSTERDAM--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Stryker (NYSE:SYK), a global leader in medical technologies, today announced the release of its Gamma4 Hip Fracture Nailing System in most of the European markets. The newest Gamma system will provide surgeons with the next generation of Stryker’s intramedullary nailing system. The Gamma4 system is designed to treat hip and femur fractures and streamline procedural workflows for surgeons. The system received the CE certification in Europe in September 2023. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240326868923/en/The Gamma4 System is indicated for the treatment of fractures in the intracapsular, trochanteric, subtrochanteric and shaft regions of the femur (including osteoporotic and osteopenic bone). (Photo: Business Wire) “The Gamma4 system represents the latest chapter of the Gamma legacy, and we are excited to expand availability to our European customers after a successful launch in the U.S.,” said Markus Ochs, vice president and general manager of Stryker’s European Trauma & Extremities division. “This latest system demonstrates our commitment to working together with our customers to understand their needs. With evolved features to the trusted Gamma system, we believe the system will help our customers rebuild patient lives.” Used in over 25,000 cases in North America and Japan, the Gamma4 System is indicated for the treatment of fractures in the intracapsular, trochanteric, subtrochanteric and shaft regions of the femur (including osteoporotic and osteopenic bone). Key features include: A redefined nail design. Designed using our SOMA database of over 34,000 3D bone models generated from CT scans1, Gamma4 has a chamfered distal tip, a 5mm shorter proximal body compared to Gamma3, and a length-dependent radius of curvature (RoC) for long nails2, enhancing anatomical fit and usability. Improved workflow. The Precision Pin™ offers more resistance to pull out, and the potential for skiving is reduced by 66% compared to a standard ∅3.2 K-wire.3 Integrated instrument platform. Gamma4 and T2Alpha nails now all work on the same instrument platform, standardizing surgical procedures. “The Gamma system has evolved through streamlined processes, standardization and meticulous attention to detail, all crafted to elevate operative techniques and enhance usability,” said Dr. Gilbert Taglang, chairman of the OTCF Education Committee. “With an unwavering focus on surgeon experience and feedback, our goal was to not only enhance ease of use but also prioritize the well-being of the patient. The new Gamma4 system redefines hip fracture care with sleek instrumentation, advanced nail design and improved geometry collectively, ensuring a lasting impact on orthopaedic practices for years to come.” About Stryker Stryker is a global leader in medical technologies and, together with its customers, is driven to make healthcare better.

CEO Peter Jackson emphasizes the company's strong performance and strategic focus. Positive Strong fiscal year 2023 results announced by Flutter Entertainment with 17.5% revenue growth and fiscal year 2024 guidance introduced. US business showed remarkable revenue growth of 40.7% and achieved positive Adjusted EBITDA, expanding into new states. Group Ex-US revenue increased by 16.4%, led by UKI and International markets. Flutter reported a net loss of $1,211m, attributed to non-cash charges, but demonstrated Further Adjusted EBITDA growth of 45.4%. The company improved its leverage ratio to 3.1x, showcasing financial strength and stability. CEO Peter Jackson highlighted the company's strong performance and strategic direction for future growth. Negative Net loss of $1,211m reported by Flutter Entertainment for fiscal year 2023 due to non-cash charges. Reduction in net cash provided by operating activities by 19.4% primarily from Sisal's record lottery jackpot win. Challenging market conditions in Australia expected to impact profitability further in 2024. Increase in net debt to $5,795m at the end of December 31, 2023 compared to $5,674m in 2022. Financial Analyst The financial performance of Flutter Entertainment reflects a significant year-over-year growth, with notable increases in revenue and average monthly players. The expansion in the US market is particularly striking, where the company has reported a substantial increase in revenue and has achieved a positive Adjusted EBITDA for the first time. This indicates a strong execution of their growth strategy in a highly competitive market. The leverage ratio improvement suggests a healthier balance sheet, which could enhance the company's ability to invest and grow further. However, the net loss driven by non-cash charges raises concerns about the long-term sustainability of current growth rates and the potential need for strategic adjustments, especially considering the trademark impairment charge related to the PokerStars brand. Market Research Analyst Flutter Entertainment's strategic 'local hero' approach seems to be paying dividends, as evidenced by their market share gains in various regions. This localized strategy, coupled with the acquisition of Sisal, has allowed the company to deepen its footprint in international markets. The reported growth in UKI and 'Consolidate and Invest' markets indicates a successful differentiation in these regions. However, the decline in the Australian market could signal a need for a reassessment of strategies in markets facing regulatory changes or reduced customer engagement. The emphasis on product innovation and customer acquisition in the US points to a focus on long-term market dominance, despite the high costs associated with these initiatives. Legal and Compliance Expert The reported financials indicate a proactive approach by Flutter Entertainment in addressing the evolving regulatory landscape, particularly in the US market. The increase in corporate overhead, partly attributed to new compliance requirements as a US-listed company, reflects the company's commitment to adhering to stringent regulatory standards. The trademark impairment of PokerStars suggests a strategic pivot that aligns with regulatory expectations and market dynamics. Investors should be aware of the potential for further regulatory changes that could impact the company's operations and profitability, especially in regions like Australia where increased regulatory costs are anticipated. 03/26/2024 - 03:00 AM DUBLIN, IRELAND & TORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / March 26, 2024 / Flutter Entertainment (LSE:FLTR)(NYSE:FLUT), the world's leading online sports betting and iGaming operator, today announced results for fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

This was underpinned by a localized approach to technology and product coupled with the unique scale advantages of the Flutter Edge.As anticipated, our number one position in the US has transformed the Group's earnings profile during 2023 as FanDuel delivered a positive US full year Adjusted EBITDA for the first time. Outside of the US we made excellent progress integrating Sisal into our International business, a business which is a great example of our ""local hero"" strategy at work, and took market share in UKI.We also made further progress on our sustainability strategy with an increase in Play Well safer gambling tool usage, investment of over $100m in our global safer gambling initiatives including key marketing campaigns in the US with our FanDuel ambassadors to promote responsible play during the year.I was proud to see Flutter shares trading for the first time on the NYSE on January 29, 2024 and we have been encouraged by the increased focus from new US investors as a result of our US listing. We are working towards a shareholder vote on May 1, 2024 to approve our primary listing move to NYSE.The year has started well with very good momentum continuing into Q1.Record Super Bowl engagement contributed to US revenue growth of 55.6% for the period from January 1, 2024 to March 17, 2024. We also launched in North Carolina where we have been really pleased with performance to date. Outside of the US, revenue grew 6.3% as the market driven decline in Australia was more than offset by the growth of our UKI and other International businesses. We believe that our strategy and competitive advantages position us well to continue to grow the business through both organic and inorganic opportunities.""FY 23 Operating Review:US:FanDuel had another excellent yea ras we consolidated our position as America's number one online sportsbook, with NGR market share of 53.4% (GGR share 43.2%) for Q4 20235, while our iGaming strategy is delivering substantial market share gains, achieving 25.7% share in Q4 2023.As of the end of January 2024, FanDuelis the number one iGaming brand based on GGR5.FanDuel acquired over 3.7m new sports betting and iGaming players in 2023, 19% more than the prior year. The average projected payback period on investment to acquire customers remains in line with recent years at less than 18 months4 giving us the confidence to continue investing in further customer acquisition. When combined with the strong contribution from our existing player base, this will drive the long-term profitability of the business.FanDuel launched compelling new product features during the recent NFL season which increased player engagement. The Parlay Hub drove over 1.5m pre-packaged Same Game Parlays ('SGP) on Super Bowl 2024 alone. The Pulse improved our live betting experience, and contributed to a near three-fold year on year increase in the proportion of live SGP bets during Super Bowl 2024.In iGaming, we launched 82% more gaming titles than the prior year, and also secured periods of exclusive access to some of the sector's most famous games. We also expanded our iGaming team,agreed new partnerships and added new features to our product proposition. Our iGaming strategy is delivering strongly, and we believe we have now achieved product parity with our closest competitors. With a strong pipeline of further new products, including greater jackpot and multi-player functionality expected to be provided by the acquisition of Beyond Play we signed in February 2024, we are well-placed for further market share gains.Group Ex-US:Performance in UKI was strong during 2023, taking share across both retail and online channels, with our estimated 2023 online UK market share growing by 2 percentage points to 30%6. Our continuous focus on our product proposition saw us further enhance our higher-margin Bet Builder and Build-A-Bet parlay products. We added exclusive new betting markets, and launched well-received new products like 'Acca Freeze' on Sky Bet which drove increased penetration of these high-margin products and benefitted our net revenue margin.We also rolled out new iGaming features with improved cross-sell journeys for sportsbook customers to iGaming products and expanded content, particularly for Live casino. These changes drove iGaming AMP growth of 11.8% and record multi-product player rates with Paddy Power reaching 53% of sports customers playing iGaming in Q4.In Australia, Sportsbet grew AMPs by 1.9% to 1.1 million, driven by high levels of retention. Average spend per player has however reduced back to pre-Covid levels. We have also seen a softness in the racing market across the second half of 2023, which we expect to persist through 2024. We expect the challenging market, along with increased regulatory and compliance costs, to reduce Australian profitability further in 2024. However, we believe Sportsbet's scale, 45% market share9, and leadership in brand and product, position us well for the future.The effectiveness of our International strategy to buy and build podium positions was evident from our strong 2023 performance with growth across both revenue and AMPs. We continued to focus on targeted investment and a ""local hero"" strategy in key ""Consolidate and Invest"" markets while optimizing the PokerStars business which has a greater presence in our ""Optimize and Maintain"" geographies.In Italy, Sisal is the #1 online brand across the combined sports, iGaming and lotterymarket9and helped deliver 10.3% pro forma revenuegrowth10. We grew market share in Georgia and Armenia, continued to leverage key local partnerships in Brazil where we also improved our customer registration journey, delivered good growth in Spain with a refreshed product proposition, and drove strong online adoption in Turkey. We believe we are well-placed for continued expansion in India having successfully maintained our high levels of customer engagement following the change in tax regime in Q4. The acquisition of Maxbet was completed in January 2024 and the plans to integrate the business are progressing well.FY 2023 financial highlights: Group In $ millionsRevenueAdjusted EBITDAFurther Adjusted EBITDA 20232022YOYYOY CC20232022YOYYOY CC20232022YOYYOY CC US4,4843,18740.7%40.6%65(347) 167(263) UKI3,0472,66414.4%13.7%88875717.2%16.0%91177717.3%16.0%Australia1,4471,558(7.1%)(2.8%)348477(27.0%)(23.1%)356485(26.7%)(22.8%)International2,8122,05536.8%34.2%59239549.8%41.5%62741750.4%42.7%Unallocated corporate overhead11 (215)(141)52.7%48.3%(187)(127)47.2%42.7%Group Ex-US7,3066,27716.4%16.6%1,6131,4898.4%8.2%1,7071,55210.0%9.8%Group11,7909,46324.6%24.7%1,6781,14246.9%46.6%1,8741,28945.4%45.1% The Group delivered strong revenue growth for 2023 up24.6% year on year to $11,790m. We continued to expand our recreational customer base across all segments, with AMPs up 20.3% year on year to 12.3m. FanDuel was a key driver of this growth, with revenue in our US business up 40.7% despite customer friendly sports results. The impact of sports results is calculated as the difference between our expected net revenue margin and actual net revenue margin and had an approximately 7.8 percentage point negative impact on US revenue growth.Group Ex-US revenue growth of 16.4% was driven by a strong performance in UKI and in our ""Consolidate and Invest""7 International markets.We also benefited from the full year consolidation of the Sisal business acquired during 2022, which generated $1,218m in revenue compared with $465m in 2022. This was partly offset by the impact of softer racing market conditions in Australia combined with a reduced level of Australian player engagement compared with the prior year,following easing of COVID-19 restrictions. On a pro forma basis, revenue growth for the Group-Ex US was6.3%10.The Group reported a net loss for 2023of $1,211m after recording a number of non-cash expenses including (i) a loss of $725m relating to an impairment of trademarks associated with the PokerStars business reflecting ""local hero"" strategy and PokerStars' presence in predominantly lower growth ""Optimize and Maintain"" markets;(ii) a loss of $165 million relating to a change in the fair value of the Fox Option liability (2022: $83m gain); and (iii) amortization of acquired intangibles charge of $791 million (2022: $655m). The increases in the net loss, the net loss margin and the net loss per share during 2023 compared with 2022, were all primarily due to the PokerStars impairment loss and the change in the fair value of the Fox Option liability.The Group delivered Further Adjusted EBITDA2 growth of 45.4% to $1,874m. This growth reflects the strong performance described above and an expansion in Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin2 of 230 basis points. This margin growth was primarily driven by the inflection of our US division to positive Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by (i) the impact of the annualization of 2022 point of consumption tax rate increases in Australia; and (ii) an increase in unallocated corporate overhead (excl. Share compensation expense) of 47.2% to $187m. This reflected greater investment in Group resource and Flutter Edge capabilities, due to the rapid growth of the business in recent years, as well as new compliance requirements as a U.S. listed company11.Loss per share increased to $(6.89) per share due to the increase in net loss discussed above. Adjusted Earnings Per Share4 grew 25.8% to $3.51 year on year reflecting the Further Adjusted EBITDA2 growth as detailed above which was partially offset by (i) an increase in Interest expense, net, when compared with 2022 as a result of the full year impact from the increased borrowings to fund the Sisal acquisition, as well as a higher cost of debt during 2023, (ii) the change in the Fox Option liability from a gain of $83m in 2022 to a loss in 2023 of $165m; and (iii) an increase in Adjusted Income tax expense primarily due to geographic profit mix changes.The Group net cashflow provided by operating activities in 2023 decreased 19.4% compared with 2022 reflecting a decrease in player liabilities following the record lottery jackpot win in Sisal in February 2023. Adjusted FreeCash Flow2growth of 62.8% was primarily driven by the inflection of our US business.Total debt increased from $6,750m to $7,056m while net debt2 increased from $5,674m at December 31, 2022 to $5,795m at December 31, 2023. Further Adjusted EBITDA2 growth reduced the Group's leverageratio2to 3.1x from 4.4x at the end of December, 31 2022 bringing the Group closer to the now updated medium term target of 2.0-2.5x.FY 2023 financial highlights: SegmentsUS revenue increased 40.7% year on year with strong growth in sportsbook and iGaming of 45.9% and 47.2% respectively. Sportsbook revenue benefitted from expansion into three additional sportsbook states, a full year's contribution from 2022 new state opening sand 24.8% growth in pre-2022 states. iGaming revenue growth was driven by strong player volumes with iGaming AMPs 41.8% higher than 2022. Adjusted EBITDA2and Further Adjusted EBITDA2grew $412m and $430m respectively due to the top line growth, combined with operating leverage efficiencies in sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses.UK Istrong revenue growth of 14.4% (13.7% on a constant currency basis)was driven by a continued expansion of our recreational customer base as we grew ourAMPsby5.4%, while delivering more efficient generosity to our customers. This resulted in sportsbook revenue growth of 10.5% and iGaming revenue up 18.1%. Adjusted EBITDA2 and Further Adjusted EBITDA2 growth of 17.2% and 17.3% respectively, reflected the revenue performance coupled with continued focus on driving marketing efficiencies which delivered an increase in both Adjusted EBITDA Margin2 and Further Adjusted EBITDA2 Margin of 70 basis points.Australia revenue was 7.1% lower year on year or 2.8% lower on a constant currency basis2. This was due to a softer racing market environment during 2023 when compared to 2022, which also benefited from higher levels of customer engagement following Covid related restrictions. The reduction year on year in AdjustedEBITDA2and Further AdjustedEBITDA2of 27.0% and 26.7% respectively, reflected this, as well as the annualization of 2022 point of consumption tax rate increases which drove a decline in Adjusted EBITDA Margin2 and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin2 of 650 and 660 basis points, respectively.International grew AMPs by 31.0% and revenue by 36.8%, or 34.2% on a constant currency2 basis while Sisal generated $1,218m in revenue during 2023 compared with $465m in 2022 post acquisition. On a pro forma basis, International revenue grew 6.0% with ""Consolidate and Invest"" markets up 13.7% year on year10. This included Italy +10.0%, Georgia & Armenia +17.0%, Turkey +36.2% (despite a material foreign currency headwind), India +24.0%, Spain +15.5% and Brazil +6.5%. Adjusted EBITDA2 and Further Adjusted EBITDA2 were 49.8% and 50.4% higher year on year, respectively (41.5% and 42.7% on a constant currency basis, respectively), reflecting the top line growth above. In addition, optimization of sales and marketing expenses led to a year on year reduction of 570 basis points as a percentage of revenue. This contributed to an expansion in Adjusted and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 180 and 200 basis points, respectively.Q1 2024 to date trading updateJanuary 1 to March17, 2024 compared withJanuary 1 to March17, 202312 Period on period growth rates Sportsbook net revenue marginSportsbook net revenue marginSportsbook revenueiGaming revenueOther revenueTotal revenueUS8.5%+230bps63.7%50.3%(6.5%)55.6%UKI11.9%+30bps9.6%27.7%4.9%17.3%Australia12.8%+160bps(8.8%) (8.8%)International9.8%(420bps)(13.0%)7.5%20.9%3.0%Group ex-US11.8%(20bps)(2.2%)14.8%11.3%6.3%Group9.7%+110bps26.0%22.2%2.3%23.4%The Q1 trading update is based on how segments will be reported in 2024.

In the above table, 2023 comparative numbers are on a 2024 comparable basis.US: trading has been strong with total revenue growth of 55.6%:Strong sportsbook revenue growth of 63.7% driven by sportsbook staking +19.6%, combined with a 230bps sportsbook net revenue margin improvement. The higher sportsbook net revenue margin is driven by ongoing structural margin improvements and significant prior year promotional spend on customer acquisition on launches in Ohio (January 1, 2023) and Massachusetts (March, 10 2023). This was partly offset by an unfavorable year on year sports results impact. The current year period includes seven days of North Carolina trading following launch on March 10, 2024.iGaming revenue growth of 50.3%, benefitting from our larger player base and continued product improvements.Excluding revenue from new state launches in both periods, total revenue increased by 34.1%.UKI: revenue +17.3% with improved product proposition driving momentum into 2024, most notably in gaming +27.7%.Australia: revenue reduced by 8.8% due to racing market softness continuing into 2024, partly offset by favorable sports resultsInternational: revenue increased by 3.0%. The addition of MaxBet was more than offset by customer friendly sports results in Italy reducing sportsbook net revenue margin by 420bps.

In the above table, 2023 numbers are shown on a 2024 comparable basis.16We are introducing 2024 guidance with the following expectations:US: Revenue and Further Adjusted EBITDA mid-points of $6.0bn and $710m, representing year on year growth of 36.3% and 206.1% respectively. The phasing of revenue is expected to be broadly in line with the prior year, allowing for the prior year impact of sports results being favorable in Q2 and unfavorable in Q4. We expect cost of sales as a percentage of net revenue to be approximately 56.5% in 2024 and approximately 30.0% of Further Adjusted EBITDA to be generated in H1, with Q2 being higher than Q1 due to the timing of new state openings.Group ex-US: Revenue and Further Adjusted EBITDA mid-points of $7.85bn and $1.73bn, representing year on year growth of 6.3% and 5.4% respectively. This includes a Further Adjusted EBITDA expectation of approximately $250m in Australia, reflective of the current market softness and increased taxes.Guidance is provided (i) on the basis that sports results are in line with our expected margin for the remainder of the year, (ii) at current foreign exchange rates, and (iii) on the basis of a consistent regulatory and tax framework.A reconciliation of our forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure cannot be provided without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact of the adjusting items necessary for such a reconciliation to be prepared of items that have not yet occurred, are out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted.Capital structure updateIn August 2023, we outlined that we would consider the appropriate level of leverage for the Group given our plans to become US listed, as well as the positive cash flows and future profitability profile expected for the Group. Following extensive discussions with shareholders, the Board has confirmed that our medium-term target leverage ratio will increase to 2.0-2.5x (from previously disclosed1.0x-2.0x3). In line with our approach in the past and given the expected improvement in Adjusted EBITDA profile of the Group, the Board will also allow flexibility for the leverage ratio to be higher than this range in support of value-creating acquisition opportunities.Listing updateWe were pleased to announce on January29, 2024that Flutter shares commenced trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol: ""FLUT"" (CUSIP No.: G3643J 108).

Average Monthly Players (""AMPs"") is defined as the average over the applicable reporting period of the total number of players who have placed and/or wagered a stake and/or contributed to rake or tournament fees during the month. This measure does not include individuals who have only used new player or player retention incentives, and this measure is for online players only and excludes retail player activity. In circumstances where a player uses multiple product categories within one brand, we are generally able to identify that it is the same player who is using multiple product categories and therefore count this player as only one AMP at the Group level while also counting this player as one AMP for each separate product category that the player is using. As a result, the sum of the AMPs presented at the product category level is greater than the total AMPs presented at the Group level. See ""-"" Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Key Operational Metrics"" of the Company's Amendment No. 1 to the Registration Statement on Form 20-F as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""), on January 18, 2024 for additional information regarding how we calculate AMPs data, including a discussion regarding duplication of players that exists in such data.2.

See ""Definitions of non-GAAP financial measures"" and ""Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" sections of this document for definitions of these measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Due to rounding, these numbers may not add up precisely to the totals provided.3. Leverage ratio target as previously disclosed of 1-2x was calculated as IFRS Net Debt divided by IFRS Adjusted EBITDA.4. Payback is calculated as the projected average length of time it takes players to generate sufficient Adjusted gross profit to repay the original average cost of acquiring those players. Customer acquisition costs include the marketing and associated promotional spend incurred to acquire a customer. The projected Adjusted gross profit is based on predictive models considering inputs such as staking behavior, interaction with promotional offers and gross revenue margin. Projected Adjusted gross profit includes associated variable costs of revenue as well as retention generosity costs.5.

The proforma financial information is for informative purpose only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the Sisal acquisition has taken place as of January 1, 2022.11. Unallocated corporate overhead includes shared technology, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to specific segments.12. The net revenue margin and revenue information presented for the period from January 1 to March 17, 2024 as compared to the period from January 1 to March 17, 2023 should not be taken as an indication of expected results for the three months ended March 31, 2024, which may differ materially.13. Foreign exchange rates at March 20, 2024 assumed in our 2024 guidance were USD:GBP of 0.790, USD:EUR of 0.920 and USD:AUD of 1.530.14.

The cash impact of transaction fees and restructuring and integration costs, represents costs associated with (i) transaction fees related to the listing of Flutter's ordinary shares in the U.S. and proposed primary listing move, (ii) advisory fees in connection with acquisitions, and (iii) costs arising from strategic initiatives to integrate acquisitions within the Group.16. See ""PokerStars US 2024 Reporting reconciliation"" section below for a reconciliation of US revenue, US Further Adjusted EBITDA, Group Ex-US revenue and Group Ex-US Further Adjusted EBITDA as reported in 2023 with PokerStars US within the US segment to the 2024 reporting basis with PokerStars US within the International segment which will be reflected in Q1 reporting.Definitions of non-GAAP financial measuresThis press release includes Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Group Ex-US Adjusted EBITDA, Group Ex-US Further Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Profit Attributable to Flutter Shareholders, Adjusted Earnings Per Share (""Adjusted EPS""), Segment Further Adjusted EBITDA, leverage ratio, Net Debt, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, constant currency and IFRS Adjusted EBITDA which are non-GAAP financial measures that we use to supplement our results presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). These non-GAAP measures are presented solely as supplemental disclosures to reported GAAP measures because we believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance, similar to measures reported by its publicly-listed U.S. competitors, and regularly used by analysts, lenders, financial institutional and investors as measures of performance. Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Profit Attributable to Flutter Shareholders, Adjusted EPS, Segment Further Adjusted EBITDA, leverage ratio, Net Debt and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, are not intended to be substitutes for any GAAP financial measures, and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of performance of other companies in other industries or within the same industry.Constant currency reflects certain operating results on a constant-currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our results without regard to the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. The term foreign currency exchange rates refer to the exchange rates used to translate our operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar, into U.S. Dollars. Because we are a global company, foreign currency exchange rates used for translation may have a significant effect on our reported results. In general, our financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. Dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. Dollar. References to operating results on a constant-currency basis mean operating results without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe the disclosure of constant-currency results is helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of our results by increasing the transparency of our underlying performance by excluding the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. We calculate constant currency revenue, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Further Adjusted EBITDA by translating prior-period revenue, Further Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Further Adjusted EBITDA, as applicable, using the average exchange rates from the current period rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect in the prior period.Adjusted EBITDA is defined on a Group basis as net profit/(loss) before income taxes; other (expense)/income, net; interest expense, net; depreciation and amortization; transaction fees and associated costs; restructuring and integration costs; legal settlements (loss contingencies), and impairment of PPE and intangible assets.Further Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA excluding share-based compensation.Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin is Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue, respectively.Segment Further Adjusted EBITDA is defined as segment Adjusted EBITDA which is our segment measure of profit or loss excluding share-based compensation. Segment Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin is segment Adjusted Further Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. From January 1, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA will exclude the cost of share-based compensation. We believe that this presentation is common practice in our industry and improves comparability of our results with those of our peers.Group Ex-US Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Group Adjusted EBITDA excluding our US Segment Adjusted EBITDA.Group Ex-US Further Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Group Ex-US Adjusted EBITDA excluding share-based compensation.Adjusted Net Profit Attributable to Flutter Shareholders is defined as net profit/(loss) as adjusted for after-tax effects of transaction fees and associated costs; restructuring and integration costs; legal settlements (loss contingencies), gaming taxes dispute, amortization of acquired intangibles, accelerated amortization, loss/(gain) on settlement of long-term debt, impairment of PPE and intangible assets, financing related fees not eligible for capitalization, gain from disposal of businesses and share-based compensation.Adjusted EPS is calculated by dividing adjusted net income attributable to Flutter shareholders by the number of diluted weighted-average ordinary shares outstanding in the period.Adjusted EBITDA, Further Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Further Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Segment Further Adjusted EBITDA, Group Ex-US Adjusted EBITDA, Group Ex-US Further Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net profit attributable to Flutter shareholders and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP measures and should not be viewed as measures of overall operating performance, indicators of our performance, considered in isolation, or construed as alternatives to operating profit/(loss), net profit/(loss) measures or earnings per share, or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities, as measures of liquidity, or as alternatives to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.IFRS Adjusted EBITDA is defined on a Group basis as net profit/(loss) before income taxes; financial income; financial expense; depreciation and amortization; transaction fees and associated costs; restructuring and integration costs and impairment of PPE and intangible assets.Management has historically used these measures when evaluating operating performance because we believe that they provide additional perspective on the financial performance of our core business.Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA has further limitations as an analytical tool. Some of these limitations are:they do not reflect the Group's cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditure or contractual commitments;they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Group's working capital needs;they do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on the Group's debt;although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in the Group's statements of cash flows; andthe further adjustments made in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Further Adjusted EBITDA are those that management consider not to be representative of the underlying operations of the Group and therefore are subjective in nature.Net debt is defined as total debt, excluding premiums, discounts, and deferred financing expense, and the effect of foreign exchange that is economically hedged as a result of our cross-currency interest rate swaps reflecting the net cash outflow on maturity less cash and cash equivalents.Leverage ratio is defined as net debt divided by Further Adjusted EBITDA. We use this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate our financial leverage. We present net debt to Further Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it is more representative of our financial position as it is reflective of our ability to cover our net debt obligations with results from our core operations, and is an indicator of our ability to obtain additional capital resources for our future cash needs. We believe net debt is a meaningful financial measure that may assist investors in understanding our financial condition and recognizing underlying trends in our capital structure. The Leverage Ratio is not substitute for, and should be used in conjunction with, GAAP financial ratios. Other companies may calculate leverage ratios differently.Adjusted Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities excluding changes in operating assets and liabilities related to player deposits, investment and player deposit liabilities, cash paid for transaction fees and associated cost, restructuring fees and integration cost less payments for property and equipment, intangible assets and capitalized software. We believe that excluding these items from adjusted free cash flow better portrays our ability to generate cash, as such items are not indicative of our operating performance for the period. This non-GAAP measure may be useful to investors and other users of our financial statements as a supplemental measure of our cash performance, but should not be considered in isolation, as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes, or as an alternative to operating cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Free Cash Flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. Our calculation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.Consolidated Balance Sheets:($ in millions except share and per share amounts) As of December 31, 2023 2022Assets Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents$1,497 $966Cash and cash equivalents -

Mining Law Ruling Following a process commenced by the Company in July 2023, a Federal judge in Mexico has granted its applications for Federal protection, or ‘Amparos’, to conduct its activities under the previous (1994) mining-related laws, and is thereby not subject to the 2023 reforms for both the Los Reyes Project, as well as the adjacent El Rey claim once the latter claim is granted. Critical to the rulings, the granted applications protect the Los Reyes Project and El Rey claims constitutionally from any further changes to mining related laws in Mexico. This protection extends to the 2023 mining-related laws, which included reforms to water usage, reclamation considerations and the scope and term of mining concessions. As expected and required by law, the government has appealed the rulings. However, the rulings are expected to be upheld given the procedural shortcomings of the 2023 mining law implementation and likelihood that the 2023 reforms will be deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Maintaining Health and Safety Protocols Prime remains engaged with local stakeholders and is proactive in monitoring employees and contractors concerning general health conditions. The Company continues to closely adhere to the directives of all levels of government and relevant health authorities in Mexico and Canada. Community Engagement and Environmental Stewardship Strategy We continued to gather environmental and community data in the quarter in support of our ESG programs, including completion of a materiality assessment, strategic plan, and disclosure matrix. We strive to minimize the environmental footprint of our activities and ensure that Los Reyes has a positive impact on our host communities. The Company released its initial sustainability report during April 2023 which establishes a baseline and a new yardstick to measure our progress in meeting our commitments regarding sustainability and stewardship of the environment, relevant social issues, and corporate governance.

This evaluation will also include prioritization of targets based on probability of resource development and generative area discovery potential. Five drill rigs are currently active on site at Los Reyes, with 2024 exploration focused on: Extending the high-grade Z-T Area shoots that remain open at depth, as well as along strike, both north and south.Expanding the known high-grade mineralization at Guadalupe East.Increasing the Central Area resource through additions at Noche Buena and its connection to San Miguel East.Generative target drilling of high-grade intercepts at Las Primas, Mariposa, Fresnillo, Mina and others to further develop the resource potential at Los Reyes. QA/QC Protocols and Sampling Procedures Drill core at the Los Reyes project is drilled in predominately HQ size (63.5 millimetre “mm”), reducing to NQ (47.6 mm) when required. Drill core samples are generally 1.50 m long along the core axis with allowance for shorter or longer intervals if required to suit geological constraints. After logging intervals are identified to be sampled, the core is cut and one half is submitted for assay. RC drilling returns rock chips and fines from a 133.35 mm diameter tricone bit. The returns are homogenized and split into 2 halves, with one half submitted for analysis and the other half stored. Sample QA/QC measures include unmarked certified reference materials, blanks, and field duplicates as well as preparation duplicates are inserted into the sample sequence and make up approximately 8% of the samples submitted to the laboratory for each drill hole. Samples are picked up from the Project by the laboratory personnel and transported to their facilities in Durango or Hermosillo Mexico, for sample preparation. Sample analysis is carried out by Bureau Veritas and ALS Labs, with fire assay, including over limits fire assay re-analysis, completed at their respective Hermosillo, Mexico laboratories and multi-element analysis completed in North Vancouver, Canada. Drill core sample preparation includes fine crushing of the sample to at least 70% passing less than 2 mm, sample splitting using a riffle splitter, and pulverizing a 250-gram split to at least 85% passing 75 microns. Gold in diamond drill core is analyzed by fire assay and atomic absorption spectroscopy of a 30 g sample (code FA430 or Au-AA23). Multi-element chemistry is analyzed by 4-Acid digestion of a 0.25-gram sample split (code MA300 or ME-ICP61) with detection by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer for a full suite of elements. Gold assay techniques FA430 and Au-AA23 have an upper detection limit of 10 ppm. Any sample that produces an over-limit gold value via the initial assay technique is sent for gravimetric finish via method FA-530 or Au-GRA21. Silver analyses by MA300 and ME-ICP61 have an upper limit of 200 ppm and 100 ppm, respectively. Samples with over-limit silver values are re-analyzed by fire assay with gravimetric finish FA530 or Au-GRA21. Both Bureau Veritas and ALS Labs are ISO/IEC accredited assay laboratories. Additional Notes Metres is represented by “m”; “etw” is Estimated True Width and is based on drill hole geometry or comparisons with other on-section drill holes; “Au” refers to gold, and “Ag” refers to silver; “gpt” is grams per metric tonne; some figures may not sum due to rounding; Composite assay grades presented in summary tables are calculated using a Au grade minimum average of 0.20 gpt or 1.0 gpt as indicated in “Au Cut-off” column of Summary Tables. Maximum internal waste included in any reported composite interval is 3.00 m. The 1.00 gpt Au cut-off is used to define higher-grade “cores” within the lower-grade halo. Gold equivalent grades are calculated based on an assumed gold price of US$1,700 per ounce and silver price of $22 per ounce, based on the formula AuEq grade (gpt) = Au grade + (Ag grade x ($22 / $1,700)). Metallurgical recoveries are not considered in the in-situ grade estimate but are estimated to be 93% and 83% for gold and silver, respectively, when processed in a mill, and 72% and 25% respectively when heap-leached. About the Los Reyes Gold and Silver Project Los Reyes is a rapidly evolving high-grade, low sulphidation epithermal gold-silver project located in Sinaloa State, Mexico. Since acquiring Los Reyes in 2019, Prime has spent approximately CAD$48 million on direct exploration activities and has completed over 168,000 metres of drilling. On May 2, 2023, Prime announced an updated multi-million-ounce high-grade open pit constrained resource (see the May 2, 2023 press release for more details). May 2, 2023 Resource Statement Drilling is on-going and suggests that the three known main deposit areas (Guadalupe, Central and Z-T) are larger than previously reported. Potential also exists for new discoveries where mineralized trends have been identified outside of the currently defined resource areas. Historic operating results indicate that an estimated 1 million ounces of gold and 60 million ounces of silver were recovered from five separate operations at Los Reyes between 1770 and 1990. Prior to Prime’s acquisition, recent operators of Los Reyes had spent approximately US$20 million on exploration, engineering, and prefeasibility studies.

The strategic relationship includes equity in the venture, potential LNG offtake, and collaboration on new energy opportunities. Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill highlights the significance of the sale and welcomes Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security’s equity investment. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Market Analyst The transaction involving Woodside and LNG Japan marks a significant shift in asset distribution within the Scarborough Joint Venture. The sale's considerable proceeds of US$910 million reflect the strategic importance of the gas reserves, particularly as countries like Japan seek to secure energy sources amidst the global energy transition. The involvement of the Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC) underscores the national interest in this deal, highlighting energy security as a pivotal factor in such international energy investments.From an energy market perspective, the reduction in Woodside's proved and probable reserves due to the sale is material. However, Woodside's decision to divest a portion of its interest suggests a strategic realignment, possibly to free up capital for other investments or to de-risk its portfolio in light of the volatile nature of global energy markets. The anticipated first LNG cargo from Scarborough in 2026 will be a milestone to watch, as it will impact supply dynamics, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region where LNG demand is high. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial implications of the sale, the immediate liquidity boost of US$910 million to Woodside's balance sheet is noteworthy. This inflow of cash could potentially be used for debt reduction, funding ongoing projects, or returned to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks. Stakeholders should monitor how this capital is allocated, as it could significantly influence Woodside's financial health and future investment potential.Moreover, the reduction in Woodside's reserves is a critical factor for investors to consider. Reserves are a key metric in valuing energy companies and changes in these figures can affect the company's stock performance. The market's reaction to this news will depend on investor sentiment regarding the trade-off between immediate cash proceeds and long-term reserve potential. Additionally, the collaboration with LNG Japan on new energy opportunities could signal Woodside's strategic pivot towards diversifying its energy portfolio, which may be viewed favorably by investors concerned with sustainability. Geopolitical Risk Analyst The involvement of JOGMEC in the investment into LJ Scarborough Pty Ltd is a clear indicator of the geopolitical significance of energy security, particularly for resource-scarce countries like Japan. This move illustrates how nation-states are actively participating in securing energy assets to mitigate risks associated with geopolitical tensions and supply disruptions. The Scarborough gas project, therefore, not only holds commercial value but also carries geopolitical weight.For businesses and investors, understanding the geopolitical landscape surrounding energy resources is crucial. The stability of supply from the Scarborough field, given its location in Australia, a country with a stable geopolitical climate, adds a layer of security to the investment. This aspect may contribute to a more favorable risk assessment for Woodside and its partners, potentially attracting further investment and bolstering confidence in the project's long-term viability. 03/25/2024 - 11:18 PM PERTH, Australia--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Woodside has completed the sale of a 10% non-operating participating interest in the Scarborough Joint Venture to LJ Scarborough Pty Ltd (LNG Japan).1 The completion follows Woodside’s announcement on 8 August 2023 that it had established a strategic relationship with LNG Japan that involved three elements: equity in the Scarborough Joint Venture; potential LNG offtake; and collaboration on potential opportunities in new energy. The sale proceeds received by Woodside of US$910 million for equity in the Scarborough Joint Venture comprises the purchase price, reimbursed expenditure and escalation.2 Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill welcomed completion of the sale. “LNG Japan’s commitment to the Scarborough Joint Venture is a demonstration of the value our customers place on gas as a long-term source of energy as they navigate the energy transition. Completion of the sale to LNG Japan is a significant milestone as we progress toward first LNG cargo from Scarborough targeted in 2026. “We are also pleased to welcome Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security’s equity investment in LJ Scarborough Pty Ltd. JOGMEC’s support reflects the contribution Scarborough gas will make to Japan’s energy security.” Woodside holds a 90% interest in the Scarborough Joint Venture and will remain as operator. Following completion of the transaction with JERA announced on 23 February 2024, Woodside’s interest will be 74.9% in the Scarborough Joint Venture.3 As a result of completion of the sale, applying estimates effective as at 26 March 2024, Woodside's Scarborough field proved (1P) undeveloped reserves reduced by 128.7 MMboe to 1,158.3 MMboe (Woodside share).4 Proved plus probable (2P) undeveloped reserves reduced by 201.1 MMboe to 1,809.7 MMboe (Woodside share).5 Woodside's Scarborough field Best Estimate (2C) contingent resources reduced by 2.2 MMboe to 20.2 MMboe (Woodside share).6,7 The attached notes on petroleum reserves and resource estimates form part of this announcement. About Scarborough The Scarborough Energy Project comprises the Scarborough Joint Venture, the Pluto Train 2 Joint Venture and modifications to Pluto Train 1 to process Scarborough gas. The Scarborough Joint Venture includes the Scarborough field and associated offshore and subsea infrastructure. The Scarborough field is located approximately 375 km off the coast of Western Australia and the reservoir contains less than 0.1% carbon dioxide. Scarborough gas will be processed at the Pluto LNG facility, where Woodside is currently constructing Pluto Train 2. Woodside is operator of Pluto LNG and Pluto Train 2. In addition to the sale of a 10% non-operating participating interest in the Scarborough Joint Venture to LNG Japan, Woodside announced in February 2024 it had entered into a sale and purchase agreement with JERA for the sale of a 15.1% non-operating participating interest in the Scarborough Joint Venture.3 About LNG Japan LJ Scarborough Pty Ltd is a jointly owned subsidiary of LNG Japan Corporation (which is a 50:50 joint venture between Sumitomo Corporation and Sojitz Corporation) and Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC). JOGMEC has a 49.9% interest in LJ Scarborough Pty Ltd. Sumitomo Corporation is a leading Fortune 500 global trading and business investment company with 129 locations (Japan:20, Overseas:109) in 66 countries and regions. Sojitz Corporation consists of approximately 400 subsidiaries and affiliates located in Japan and throughout the world, developing wide-ranging general trading company operations in a multitude of countries and regions. About JOGMEC Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC) integrates the functions of the former Japan National Oil Corporation, which was in charge of securing a stable supply of oil and natural gas, and the former Metal Mining Agency of Japan, which was in charge of ensuring a stable supply of nonferrous metal and mineral resources and implementing mine pollution control measures. This announcement was approved and authorised for release by Woodside’s Disclosure Committee. Forward-looking statements This announcement contains forward-looking statements with respect to Woodside's business and operations, market conditions, results of operations and financial condition, including, for example, but not limited to, statements regarding the transaction, the timing of completion of other transactions, the timing of completion of Woodside's projects and expectations regarding future expenditures and future results of projects. All statements, other than statements of historical or present facts, are forward-looking statements and generally may be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as 'guidance', 'foresee', 'likely', 'potential', 'anticipate', 'believe', 'aim', ‘aspire’, 'estimate', 'expect', 'intend', 'may', 'target', 'plan', 'forecast', ‘outlook’, 'project', 'schedule', 'will', 'should', 'seek' and other similar words or expressions. Similarly, statements that describe the objectives, plans, goals or expectations of Woodside are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this announcement are not guidance, forecasts, guarantees or predictions of future events or performance, but are in the nature of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions. Those statements and any assumptions on which they are based are subject to change without notice and are subject to inherent known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of Woodside, its related bodies corporate and their respective officers, directors, employees, advisers or representatives. If any of the assumptions on which a forward-looking statement is based were to change or be found to be incorrect, this would likely cause outcomes to differ from the statements made in this announcement. A detailed summary of the key risks relating to Woodside and its business can be found in the ""Risk"" section of Woodside's most recent Annual Report released to the Australian Securities Exchange and the London Stock Exchange and in Woodside's most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and available on the Woodside website at https://www.woodside.com/investors/reports-investor-briefings. You should review and have regard to these risks when considering the information contained in this announcement. All information included in this announcement, including any forward-looking statements, reflects Woodside’s views held as at the date of this announcement and, except as required by law or regulation, neither Woodside, its related bodies corporate, nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, advisers or representatives intends to, undertakes to, or assumes any obligation to, provide any additional information or update or revise any information or forward-looking statements in this announcement after the date of this announcement, either to make them conform to actual results or as a result of new information, future events, changes in Woodside’s expectations or otherwise. Investors are strongly cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Actual results or performance may vary materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements. Notes to petroleum reserves and resources Unless otherwise stated, all petroleum resource estimates are quoted as at the effective date of 26 March 2024, net Woodside share. All numbers are internal estimates produced by Woodside. Estimates of reserves and contingent resources should be regarded only as estimates that may change over time as additional information becomes available. As a result of the completion of the sale, Woodside’s interest in Scarborough will reduce to 90%. This results in a change in reserves and contingent resources estimates (Woodside net equity share). There are no other changes to the underlying reserves and contingent resources estimates for the Scarborough field. The reference point is deﬁned as the outlet of the downstream (onshore) gas processing facility. ‘Reserves’ are estimated quantities of petroleum that have been demonstrated to be producible from known accumulations in which the company has a material interest from a given date forward, at commercial rates, under presently anticipated production methods, operating conditions, prices, and costs. Woodside reports reserves inclusive of all fuel consumed in operations. Woodside estimates and reports its proved reserves in accordance with SEC regulations which are also compliant with the 2018 Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE)/World Petroleum Council (WPC)/American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG)/Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers (SPEE) Petroleum Resources Management System (PRMS) (SPE-PRMS) guidelines. SEC-compliant proved reserves estimates use a more restrictive, rules-based approach and are generally lower than estimates prepared solely in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines due to, among other things, the requirement to use commodity prices based on the average of first of month prices during the 12-month period in the reporting company’s fiscal year. Woodside estimates and reports its proved plus probable reserves in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines which are not compliant with SEC regulations. Assessment of the economic value in support of an SPE-PRMS (2018) reserves and resources classification, uses Woodside Portfolio Economic Assumptions (Woodside PEAs). The Woodside PEAs are reviewed on an annual basis, or more often if required. The review is based on historical data and forecast estimates for economic variables such as product prices and exchange rates. The Woodside PEAs are approved by the Woodside Board. Specific contractual arrangements for individual projects are also taken into account. Woodside uses both deterministic and probabilistic methods for the estimation of reserves and contingent resources at the field and project levels. All proved reserves estimates have been estimated using deterministic methods and reported on a net interest basis in accordance with the SEC regulations and have been determined in accordance with SEC Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X. ‘Contingent resources’ are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations, but the applied project(s) are not yet considered mature enough for commercial development due to one or more contingencies. Contingent resources are estimated and reported in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines and may include, for example, projects for which there are currently no viable markets, or where commercial recovery is dependent on technology under development, or where evaluation of the accumulation is insufficient to clearly assess commerciality. Woodside reports contingent resources inclusive of all fuel consumed in operations. Contingent resources are different from, and should not be construed as, reserves. Contingent resources estimates may not always mature to reserves and do not necessarily represent future reserves bookings. Contingent resources volumes are reported at the ‘Best Estimate’ (P50) confidence level. 2C contingent resources are not compliant with SEC regulations. The SEC prohibits disclosure of oil and gas resources, including contingent resources, in SEC filings. However, Australian securities regulatory authorities allow disclosure of oil and gas resources, including contingent resources. ‘MMboe’ means millions (106) of barrels of oil equivalent. Natural gas volumes are converted to oil equivalent volumes via a constant conversion factor, which for Woodside is 5.7 Bcf of dry gas per 1 MMboe. All volumes are reported at standard oilfield conditions of 14.696 psi (101.325 kPa) and 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.56 degrees Celsius). ‘Proved reserves’ are those quantities of crude oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs that, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, operating contracts, and government regulations. Proved reserves are estimated and reported on a net interest basis in accordance with the SEC regulations and have been determined in accordance with SEC Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X. ‘Undeveloped reserves’ are those reserves for which wells and facilities have not been installed or executed but are expected to be recovered through future signiﬁcant investments. ‘Probable reserves’ are those reserves which analysis of geological and engineering data suggests are more likely than not to be recoverable. Proved plus probable reserves represent the best estimate of recoverable quantities. Where probabilistic methods are used, there is at least a 50% probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves. Proved plus probable reserves are estimated and reported in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines and are not compliant with SEC regulations. The estimates of petroleum reserves and contingent resources are based on and fairly represent information and supporting documentation prepared by, or under the supervision of Mr Ben Stephens, Woodside’s Vice President Reserves and Subsurface, who is a full-time employee of the company and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The reserves estimates included in this announcement are issued with the prior written consent of Mr Stephens. Mr Stephen’s qualiﬁcations include a Bachelor of Engineering (Petroleum Engineering) from the University of New South Wales, Australia, and 20 years of relevant experience. Additional information for US investors concerning resource estimates Woodside is an Australian company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, and the London Stock Exchange. As noted above, Woodside estimates and reports its proved reserves in accordance with SEC regulations, which are also compliant with SPE-PRMS guidelines, and estimates and reports its proved plus probable reserves and 2C contingent resources in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines. Woodside reports all petroleum resource estimates using definitions consistent with SPE-PRMS. The SEC prohibits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, from disclosing estimates of oil or gas resources other than ‘reserves’ (as that term is defined by the SEC). In this announcement, Woodside includes estimates of quantities of oil and gas using certain terms, such as ‘proved plus probable (2P) reserves’, ‘best estimate (2C) contingent resources’, ‘reserves and contingent resources’, ‘proved plus probable’, ‘developed and undeveloped’, ‘probable developed’, ‘probable undeveloped’, ‘contingent resources’ or other descriptions of volumes of reserves, which terms include quantities of oil and gas that may not meet the SEC’s definitions of proved, probable and possible reserves, and which the SEC’s guidelines strictly prohibit Woodside from including in filings with the SEC. These types of estimates do not represent, and are not intended to represent, any category of reserves based on SEC definitions, and may differ from and may not be comparable to the same or similarly-named measures used by other companies. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and would require substantial capital spending over a significant number of years to implement recovery, and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of not being recovered by Woodside. In addition, actual locations drilled and quantities that may be ultimately recovered from Woodside’s properties may differ substantially. Woodside has made no commitment to drill, and likely will not drill, all drilling locations that have been attributable to these quantities. U.S. investors are urged to consider closely the disclosures in Woodside’s most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC and available on the Woodside website at https://www.woodside.com/investors/reports-investor-briefings and its other filings with the SEC, which are available at www.sec.gov. __________________________ 1 The sale and purchase agreement is with LJ Scarborough Pty Ltd, a jointly owned subsidiary of LNG Japan Corporation (which is a 50:50 joint venture between Sumitomo Corporation and Sojitz Corporation) and Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC).

The offering, priced at 99.685% of their principal amount, is expected to close on Apr. 4, 2024. Ameren Missouri plans to use the net proceeds to refinance short-term debt and fund capital expenditures. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Ameren Missouri's public offering of $500 million in first mortgage bonds is a significant financial event. The pricing at 5.20% indicates a strategic move to lock in interest rates, which could potentially be lower than future rates given the current economic climate. Investors and analysts will be looking at the impact this capital infusion has on the company's debt-to-equity ratio, as well as the overall cost of capital. Refinancing short-term debt with these proceeds will likely improve the company's balance sheet and potentially its credit rating, which in turn can affect stock performance.Furthermore, the allocation of funds towards capital expenditures suggests a focus on growth or maintenance of existing infrastructure. The company's ability to efficiently deploy this capital into profitable projects will be closely monitored, as it can influence future earnings and, consequently, shareholder value. The involvement of established financial institutions as joint book-running managers could enhance investor confidence in the offering's execution. Market Research Analyst The bond offering by Ameren Missouri reflects broader market trends where corporations capitalize on investor appetite for fixed-income securities. The 5.20% interest rate is competitive and will draw attention from investors seeking stable returns, especially in a market with volatility in equities. The offering's timing, pricing and the underwriting by prominent financial firms suggest a well-orchestrated effort to attract a diverse pool of institutional and possibly retail bond investors.From a market perspective, the success of this bond issue could set a benchmark for similar utility companies considering raising capital through debt. It's important to watch the market's reception to this offering, as it can signal investor confidence not only in Ameren Missouri but also in the utility sector as a whole. This, in turn, could influence stock market dynamics, particularly for utility stocks, which are often seen as defensive investments. Energy Sector Analyst Within the energy sector, Ameren Missouri's move to refinance short-term debt and fund capital expenditures through a bond offering is indicative of the industry's ongoing need for capital to sustain operations and invest in infrastructure. The first mortgage bonds suggest a secured debt structure, providing investors with a measure of safety given the collateral backing. This could be an attractive proposition in a sector known for its capital-intensive nature.Investors will also assess the company's future revenue streams and regulatory environment, as these factors are critical in determining the ability to meet bond obligations. The proceeds aimed at capital expenditures could hint at upgrades to the grid, adoption of renewable energy sources, or other initiatives to comply with environmental regulations, all of which are pivotal in the current energy transition landscape. 03/25/2024 - 08:55 PM ST.

Silvercorp Offer for OreCorp Lapsed,2024-03-26T00:22:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,Silvercorp Metals Inc. announces the unsuccessful off-market takeover bid for OreCorp  and its entitlement to a break fee of approximately AUD$2.8 million.,"Silvercorp Offer for OreCorp Lapsed Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Silvercorp Metals Inc. announces the unsuccessful off-market takeover bid for OreCorp and its entitlement to a break fee of approximately AUD$2.8 million. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The failed takeover bid by Silvercorp Metals Inc. for OreCorp Limited represents a significant event within the mining and metals sector. The inability to secure a majority stake could signal several underlying factors such as valuation disagreements, shareholder resistance, or a more attractive competing offer. The market typically reacts to such news with an assessment of the strategic implications for the involved companies. Investors might see Silvercorp's decision to not exercise its 'right to match' as a disciplined approach to capital allocation, potentially avoiding an overpayment scenario. However, it could also be perceived as a missed opportunity to consolidate assets and achieve synergies.From a market dynamics perspective, the acquisition of a company like OreCorp, which is listed on the ASX, by a TSX and NYSE American-listed entity like Silvercorp, could have implications for global market positioning. The payment of a break fee, while a financial setback, is a relatively common occurrence in failed acquisitions and offers a small cushion for the expenses incurred during the negotiation process. The impact on Silvercorp's stock may vary, but typically, the market might view the news as Silvercorp maintaining financial prudence, especially if the competing offer is substantially higher. Financial Analyst When evaluating the financial implications of Silvercorp's unsuccessful bid, it's important to consider the opportunity cost of not proceeding with the acquisition. The break fee of approximately AUD$2.8 million, while a clear financial obligation, is minor compared to the capital that would have been deployed for the acquisition. The decision not to match a competing offer suggests that Silvercorp is weighing its investment options carefully, which might be reassuring to shareholders concerned about disciplined spending and return on investment.Furthermore, the short-term market reaction could involve a reevaluation of Silvercorp's growth strategy and future acquisition targets. In the long-term, the company's capital can be redirected towards other projects or returned to shareholders. The specifics of the competing offer, which Silvercorp chose not to match, would also be of interest to investors, as it provides insight into the company's valuation thresholds and could influence future takeover attempts by Silvercorp or other entities within the sector. Legal Expert In a takeover situation such as this, the legal framework governing the bid process is crucial. The terms set out in the Bid Implementation Deed (BID), including the break fee, are designed to protect both parties in the event of a failed takeover. Silvercorp's entitlement to the break fee under certain conditions suggests that there are legal mechanisms in place to recoup some of the costs associated with the attempted acquisition. This legal aspect, while not directly impacting the stock market, does provide a safety net that can affect the financial health of the company and, by extension, investor confidence.The 'right to match' clause is another key legal element, giving Silvercorp the option, but not the obligation, to match competing offers. Choosing not to exercise this right indicates a strategic decision that takes into account not just the immediate financial implications, but also the broader legal and regulatory landscape, which can include antitrust considerations, due diligence findings and shareholder approval processes. 03/25/2024 - 08:22 PM Trading Symbol:TSX: SVM NYSE AMERICAN: SVM VANCOUVER, BC, March 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Silvercorp Metals Inc. (""Silvercorp"" or the ""Company"") (TSX: SVM) (NYSE American: SVM) announced today that, further to its off-market takeover bid (the ""Offer"") for all of the ordinary shares in OreCorp Limited (""OreCorp"") (ASX:ORR), Silvercorp did not satisfy the 50.1% minimum acceptance condition prior to the close of the Offer on March 22, 2024 and elected not to exercise its ""right to match"" a competing offer for OreCorp.

"Update: RiverNorth Capital and Income Fund, Inc. Non-Transferable Rights Offering",2024-03-26T00:05:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"RiverNorth Capital and Income Fund, Inc. (RSF) announces a non-transferable rights offering to invest in unique private credit assets, including small business whole loans and debt securities. The offering will issue non-transferable rights to stockholders, allowing them to subscribe for new shares of common stock. The subscription price will be determined based on net asset value or market price, with the subscription period ending on April 22, 2024.

Non-Transferable Rights Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary RiverNorth Capital and Income Fund, Inc. (RSF) announces a non-transferable rights offering to invest in unique private credit assets, including small business whole loans and debt securities. The offering will issue non-transferable rights to stockholders, allowing them to subscribe for new shares of common stock. The subscription price will be determined based on net asset value or market price, with the subscription period ending on April 22, 2024. Stockholders exercising their Rights will not be eligible for Q2 repurchase offers but will be eligible for Q3 repurchase offers. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The rights offering announced by RiverNorth Capital and Income Fund, Inc. represents a strategic move to raise capital while potentially offering an opportunity for existing shareholders to increase their investment at a potentially favorable price. The structure of the offering, with the subscription price set at either 90% of the net asset value or 95% of the market price, whichever is higher, suggests a discount mechanism that could incentivize participation. However, investors should be mindful of the dilutive effect of such offerings, as an increase in the number of shares could lead to a decrease in existing shareholders' equity percentage unless they fully exercise their rights.From a market perspective, the non-transferability of the rights could limit liquidity and marketability, which might be a drawback for some investors who prefer more flexible investment options. Additionally, the exclusion of rights shares from the Q2 repurchase offer may influence investor decisions, as it delays the potential for immediate liquidity provided by repurchase offers. The long-term performance will hinge on the effective deployment of the raised capital into the private credit assets and the Fund's ability to manage the associated risks, particularly given the inherent volatility and credit risk in small business loans and BDC investments. Market Research Analyst With an interval fund structure, RiverNorth Capital and Income Fund's rights offering could appeal to investors seeking exposure to alternative credit assets, which often come with less correlation to traditional asset classes. This can be an attractive diversification strategy, especially in times of market uncertainty. The Fund's focus on unique private credit assets, including small business whole loans originated by Square Loans and debt securities issued by BDCs, taps into a niche market that is not readily accessible to the average investor.However, the complexity and risk associated with these types of investments require a thorough understanding of the underlying assets. The performance of these assets can be significantly impacted by economic shifts and interest rate changes. While the Fund's past performance has been described as attractive, it's important for investors to consider the risks and lack of liquidity associated with interval funds and the specific credit instruments within the Fund's portfolio. Legal Expert Legally, the rights offering is structured within the framework of the SEC's regulations, specifically under an effective shelf registration statement. This provides a level of regulatory oversight and investor protection. The Fund has also taken measures to ensure compliance with the Investment Company Act of 1940 by making periodic repurchase offers, which is a requirement for interval funds. Prospective participants should review the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus carefully to understand the terms and conditions, including the risks associated with the investment and the fact that the Alternative Credit Instruments are not rated by NRSROs, implying a higher credit risk akin to 'junk' bonds.It is also noteworthy that the Fund is not continuously issuing stock, which means the rights offering is a time-sensitive opportunity for investors to act. The non-entitlement to distributions for the months of March and April for shares issued in connection with the rights offering is another legal nuance that should be considered, as it affects the immediate income potential from newly acquired shares. 03/25/2024 - 08:05 PM WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- RiverNorth Capital and Income Fund, Inc. (NYSE: RSF) (the “Fund”), an exchange-listed interval fund, has filed the prospectus supplement governing the terms of its previously announced non-transferable rights offering. You can find a copy of the prospectus supplement here: XBRL Viewer (sec.gov). The proceeds from the offering will be deployed according to the Fund’s investment objective into the portfolio of unique, hard to access private credit assets including small business whole loans originated by Square Loans and debt securities issued by business development companies and closed end funds. Exposure to these less correlated, “off the run” asset classes has been a significant driver of the Fund’s attractive long-term net asset value performance. In this offering, the Fund will issue non-transferable rights (the “Rights”) to its stockholders of record as of April 1, 2024 (the “Record Date” and such stockholders, “Record Date Stockholders”) allowing the holder to subscribe for new shares of common stock of the Fund (the “Primary Subscription”). Record Date Stockholders will receive one Right for each share of common stock held on the Record Date. For every three Rights held, a holder of Rights may buy one new share of common stock of the Fund. The number of Rights to be issued to a Record Date Stockholder will be rounded up to the nearest number of Rights evenly divisible by three. Fractional shares will not be issued upon the exercise of the Rights. Accordingly, new Common Shares may be purchased only pursuant to the exercise of Rights in integral multiples of three. Record Date stockholders who fully exercise their Rights will be entitled to subscribe for additional shares of common stock (“Over-Subscription Shares”), subject to the limitations set forth in the prospectus supplement. The Over-Subscription Shares will be allocated pro rata to stockholders who over-subscribe based on the number of Rights originally issued to them. The Fund may increase the number of shares of common stock subject to subscription by up to 100% of the shares available pursuant to the Primary Subscription. The Rights are non-transferable and, therefore, may not be purchased or sold. The shares of common stock issued pursuant to the rights offering will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker: RSF. The subscription price per share of common stock will be determined based upon a formula equal to 90% of the reported net asset value or 95% of the market price per share of common stock, whichever is higher on the Expiration Date (as defined below). Market price per share of common stock will be determined based on the average of the last reported sales price of a share of common stock on the NYSE for the five trading days preceding (and not including) the Expiration Date. The subscription period will expire on April 22, 2024, unless extended by the Board (the “Expiration Date”). Record Date Stockholders who exercise their Rights will not be entitled to distributions payable during March or April 2024 on shares issued in connection with the rights offering, but they will be entitled to distributions payable during May 2024 on these shares. As a reminder, the Fund is an interval fund that makes periodic repurchase offers under Rule 23c-3 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 of at least 5% of outstanding shares quarterly. Shares issued in this rights offering will not be eligible for the Fund’s Q2 repurchase offer which ends on April 3, 2024, but will be eligible for repurchase during the Q3 offer which is scheduled to commence on June 3, 2024 and end on July 3, 2024. The rights offering will be made pursuant to the Fund’s currently effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and only by means of the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus. The Company expects to mail subscription certificates evidencing the subscription rights and a copy of the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus for the rights offering shortly following the Record Date. The securities described in this release may not be sold nor may offers to purchase be accepted prior to the time the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus are filed with the SEC. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or constitute a solicitation of an offer to buy. __________ RiverNorth Capital and Income Fund, Inc. The investment objective of the Fund is to seek a high level of current income. Fund had approximately $56.9 million of net assets and 3.4 million shares of common stock outstanding as of February 29, 2024. The Fund is a closed-end fund and does not continuously issue stock for sale as open-end mutual funds do. The Fund now trades in the secondary market. Investors wishing to buy or sell stock need to place orders through an intermediary or broker. The share price of a closed-end fund is based on the market value. Risk is inherent in all investing. Investing in any investment company security involves risk, including the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or even that you may lose part or all of your investment. Therefore, before investing in the shares of common stock, you should consider the risks as well as the other information in the prospectus, annual report, and semi-annual report. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Definitions: Business Development Companies (“BDCs”) are organizations that invest in small- and medium-sized companies as well as distressed companies. A BDC helps small- and medium-sized firms grow in the initial stages of their development. Square Loans (small business whole loans) is an invitation-only advance on the sales that retailers make through Square's point of sales system. It's essentially a merchant cash advance, meaning that you pay a fixed fee rather than interest and repay the funds with a percentage of your daily sales. See the Prospectus for a more detailed description of Fund risks. The profitability of specialty finance and other financial companies is largely dependent upon the availability and cost of capital funds and may fluctuate significantly in response to changes in interest rates, as well as changes in general economic conditions. If the borrower of Alternative Credit (as defined below) in which the Fund invests is unable to make its payments on a loan, the Fund may be greatly limited in its ability to recover any outstanding principal and interest under such loan, as (among other reasons) the Fund may not have direct recourse against the borrower or may otherwise be limited in its ability to directly enforce its rights under the loan, whether through the borrower or the platform through which such loan was originated, the loan may be unsecured or under collateralized, and/or it may be impracticable to commence a legal proceeding against the defaulting borrower. Substantially all of the Alternative Credit in which the Fund invests will not be guaranteed or insured by a third party. In addition, the Alternative Credit Instruments in which the Fund may invest will not be backed by any governmental authority. Prospective borrowers supply a variety of information regarding the purpose of the loan, income, occupation, and employment status (as applicable) to the lending platforms. As a general matter, platforms do not verify the majority of this information, which may be incomplete, inaccurate, false, or misleading. Prospective borrowers may misrepresent any of the information they provide to the platforms, including their intentions for the use of the loan proceeds. Alternative Credit Instruments are generally not rated by the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (“NRSROs”). Such unrated instruments, however, are considered to be comparable in quality to securities falling into any of the ratings categories used by such NRSROs to classify ""junk"" bonds (i.e., below investment grade securities). Accordingly, the Fund’s unrated Alternative Credit Instrument investments constitute highly risky and speculative investments similar to investments in “junk” bonds, notwithstanding that the Fund is not permitted to invest in loans that are of subprime quality at the time of investment. Although the Fund is not permitted to invest in loans that are of subprime quality at the time of investment, an investment in the Fund’s Shares should be considered speculative and involving a high degree of risk, including the risk of loss of investment. There can be no assurance that payments due on underlying loans, including Alternative Credit, will be made. Diversification does not ensure a profit or a guarantee against loss. The Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The Fund’s prospectus and most recent periodic reports contain this and other important information about the investment company and may be obtained by visiting rivernorth.com/literature or by calling 844.569.4750.

The report provides insights for emissions trading schemes, data visualizations, breaking news coverage, and market analysis, catering to compliance entities, traders, researchers, and consultants. Regional disparities in carbon pricing are highlighted, with New Zealand Units averaging NZ$70.60 per metric ton, Generic Australian Carbon Credit Units at AU$35.60, and Korean Allowance Units at ₩9,072. Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Economist An analysis of the newly launched APAC Carbon Market Report reveals a significant development in the carbon trading sector, particularly within the Asia-Pacific region. The introduction of daily price transparency is a pivotal step in enhancing the efficiency of these markets. Transparent pricing mechanisms are fundamental in markets where environmental externalities are priced, such as carbon markets. They allow for better risk assessment and informed decision-making by stakeholders, which is essential for the proper functioning of emissions trading schemes (ETS).The disparity in carbon pricing, as highlighted by the differences in the cost of carbon credits across Australia, New Zealand and South Korea, indicates the heterogeneity of the regional carbon markets. This variation can be attributed to factors such as the maturity of the respective ETS, local supply and demand dynamics and the stringency of regional climate policies. For businesses and investors, these price signals are important for strategic planning, especially for those with a carbon-intensive portfolio or those looking to invest in cleaner technologies.Long-term, the standardization of reporting and increased transparency may lead to more liquid and robust carbon markets in the APAC region. This could potentially attract more participants and foster a more competitive environment, which is beneficial for the market's overall health and efficiency. However, the variability in prices also suggests that there might be challenges in integrating these markets or linking them with other international carbon markets, which is often considered a step towards global carbon pricing. Market Research Analyst The launch of OPIS's APAC Carbon Market Report is a strategic move that caters to the growing demand for specialized environmental market data. As carbon trading becomes an integral part of corporate sustainability strategies, the need for such data services is expected to grow. This report could position OPIS as a go-to source for carbon market intelligence in the Asia-Pacific region, potentially increasing its market share and strengthening its brand among key players in the carbon trading market.From an investor's perspective, the availability of such detailed market analysis and daily price assessments can enhance the valuation models of companies involved in carbon trading or those affected by carbon pricing policies. This can lead to more accurate pricing of stocks and potentially reduce the volatility associated with regulatory uncertainties. For OPIS, as part of Dow Jones Energy, this expansion into APAC markets could drive revenue growth and diversify its customer base, which is positive for its parent company's stock performance.However, the success of this report and its impact on the market will depend on the accuracy and reliability of the data provided. If OPIS manages to establish itself as a credible source, it could become an indispensable tool for market participants, but any discrepancies or inaccuracies could damage its reputation and have negative implications for its business. 03/25/2024 - 08:00 PM New report offers daily price transparency in Australia, China, New Zealand and South Korea SINGAPORE, March 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- OPIS, a Dow Jones company and a leading provider of environmental and energy markets data, marks a decade of trusted carbon market price assessments with the launch of its inaugural APAC Carbon Market Report. Environmental programs in the Asia-Pacific region have ignited demand for carbon credits as countries increasingly implement decarbonization market initiatives to meet climate targets. These markets are diverse in their scope and ambition, which presents opportunities and risks for carbon market participants across the region.

The combined company, if approved, will be listed on NASDAQ and TSX, with Nobul's executive team leading the merged entity. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The formation of a new entity through a business combination like the one proposed between Nobul AI Corp. and Check-Cap Ltd. is often a significant event that can reshape market dynamics, particularly in the technology and fintech sectors. By merging, the companies aim to leverage AI technology to create a more competitive fintech marketplace. This move is indicative of the ongoing consolidation trend within the industry, where companies seek to combine resources to enhance their market offerings and improve operational efficiencies.From a market perspective, the listing of the combined entity on both NASDAQ and TSX would enhance its visibility and could potentially increase liquidity for its shares. The move to go public is a strategic one, signaling to the market that the company is ready to scale and compete on a larger stage. The leadership continuity with Regan McGee at the helm is likely to provide stability during the transition phase, which is often a concern for investors during mergers and acquisitions. Financial Analyst The proposed business combination is expected to be scrutinized by investors for its financial implications. Nobul's track record in M&A and PE transactions suggests a strategic approach to growth, which could translate into enhanced shareholder value. However, the integration of different corporate cultures and systems poses a risk that can impact the combined company's financial performance, especially in the short term.Investors will also be keen on the terms of the transaction, the fairness opinion provided by Kingswood Capital Partners LLC and the financial advisement from ArcStone Securities and Investment Corp. These aspects provide a level of assurance regarding the valuation and the strategic fit of the merger. The market will be looking for synergies that could lead to cost savings or revenue growth, which are critical for justifying the merger and influencing the stock price post-announcement. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding this business combination is multi-faceted, involving not only the Business Combination Agreement but also compliance with the Israeli Companies Law, given Check-Cap’s jurisdiction. The requirement for approval by Check-Cap's shareholders at a special meeting introduces a variable that could affect the timeline and certainty of the transaction. Regulatory and exchange approvals are further hurdles that need to be cleared, which means the deal is subject to scrutiny from multiple regulatory bodies, including those governing the NASDAQ and TSX.The approval process will likely involve a detailed examination of antitrust issues, given the increasing regulatory focus on competition in the tech sector. The outcome of this process is critical for stakeholders as it can significantly affect the deal's completion and the subsequent performance of the combined entity. 03/25/2024 - 07:15 PM Proposed business combination to create a North American technology company with an AI-driven fintech marketplace.

Sun's shares are trading well below intrinsic value, with a 47% stake in Cellebrite Technologies (NASDAQ: CLBT). LAM suggests distributing CLBT shares as a dividend to enhance shareholder value. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst An analysis of Sun Corporation's undervaluation from a financial perspective highlights several critical factors. The market's perception of a company's value is often influenced by its assets and future earnings potential. In this case, Sun's 47% stake in Cellebrite Technologies is a substantial asset that seems to be undervalued by the market. The discrepancy between Sun's share price and the value of its assets, particularly the Cellebrite stake, suggests that the market may not be fully recognizing the underlying value or potential synergies between the companies.Furthermore, the proposal by Leopard Asset Management to distribute Cellebrite shares as a dividend could be seen as a strategic move to unlock value. Such corporate actions often lead to a re-rating of a company's stock as it provides a direct value transfer to shareholders and can serve as a catalyst for market reassessment of the company's valuation. However, it's essential to consider the liquidity implications and whether such a distribution aligns with the company's long-term strategic goals.Lastly, the gap between the intrinsic value and market price could be indicative of broader market concerns or a lack of investor confidence in management's strategy. It's imperative for Sun's management to address these concerns transparently to restore shareholder confidence and potentially correct the market valuation. Corporate Governance Expert From a corporate governance standpoint, the situation at Sun Corporation raises questions about the board's effectiveness in representing shareholder interests. The apparent reluctance of management to engage with shareholders or to take action on the significant undervaluation is concerning. Shareholder activism, as demonstrated by Leopard Asset Management, can be a force for positive change, prompting boards to reconsider their strategies and improve transparency and communication.Additionally, the proposal to distribute dividends in the form of shares and cash could be interpreted as a mechanism to align the interests of the shareholders with those of the company, fostering a more shareholder-friendly corporate culture. However, such actions must be balanced with the need to maintain a prudent capital structure and to ensure that they do not compromise the company's financial stability or operational capabilities.It is also worth noting that a continued undervaluation and perceived inaction can lead to further shareholder agitation, potential proxy fights, or even attempts to change the composition of the board. Such scenarios can distract management from the company's core business operations and could potentially lead to instability within the company. Investment Strategist Investors looking at the situation with Sun Corporation must weigh the potential risks and rewards of the company's current undervaluation. The significant discount to intrinsic value presents a potential opportunity for value investors, but this must be tempered by an understanding of why the market is pricing the shares as it is. Market sentiment can often be swayed by factors beyond just asset value, such as management credibility, operational performance and industry trends.The recommendation by Leopard Asset Management to distribute Cellebrite shares as dividends could potentially lead to a reevaluation of Sun's stock, but investors must also consider the tax implications and the impact on the company's future cash flows. Moreover, the timing and execution of such corporate actions can significantly influence their effectiveness in correcting market mispricing.Long-term investors should also consider the company's strategic direction and the potential for future growth. A deep dive into the company's financials and operations would be prudent to assess the sustainability of its business model and the potential for value creation beyond the immediate undervaluation issue. 03/25/2024 - 08:16 PM Further information is available http://www.valueforsun.com TEL AVIV, Israel--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Leopard Asset Management Ltd. (“LAM”) advises various longstanding minority shareholders in Sun Corporation (stock code: 6736 JP). LAM is compelled to express its deep concerns regarding the company's ongoing undervaluation and management's apparent reluctance to take meaningful action to address this issue. Sun’s shares have been consistently undervalued in the market, trading well below its intrinsic value. Sun’s main asset is its 47% stake in Cellebrite Technologies (NASDAQ: CLBT). Cellebrite is a leading Israeli SaaS digital intelligence platform renowned for its capability to extract and analyze data from mobile phones. Sun’s shares have been trading consistently at discount in excess of 50% of their interstice value. Despite our repeated attempts to engage with Sun’ management to address the undervaluation, including a meeting and sending follow-up letters emphasizing the need for enhanced shareholder value, our efforts have been met with limited responsiveness. LAM believes that Sun could significantly improve shareholder value by distributing CLBT shares as a dividend in kind, alongside providing an extra cash dividend to shareholders. LAM believes Sun’s cash, investment in securities and holdings in CLBT are worth more than ¥9,000 per share, vs. the current price of ¥3,320. LAM urge Sun's management to reconsider its stance and take decisive action to address shareholder concerns promptly. Failure to do so risks further erosion of shareholder confidence and continued undervaluation of the company's shares, and call for Sun’s shareholders to demand decisive actions from management.

United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Notifies Mesoblast that Available Clinical Data from Phase 3 Trial Appear Sufficient to Support BLA Submission for Remestemcel-L in Children with Steroid-Refractory Acute Graft Versus Host Disease (SR-aGVHD),2024-03-26T02:34:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Mesoblast  receives positive feedback from the U.S. FDA on Phase 3 study for remestemcel-L in pediatric patients with SR-aGVHD, plans to resubmit BLA soon.","United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Notifies Mesoblast that Available Clinical Data from Phase 3 Trial Appear Sufficient to Support BLA Submission for Remestemcel-L in Children with Steroid-Refractory Acute Graft Versus Host Disease (SR-aGVHD) Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags clinical trial Rhea-AI Summary Mesoblast receives positive feedback from the U.S. FDA on Phase 3 study for remestemcel-L in pediatric patients with SR-aGVHD, plans to resubmit BLA soon. Positive None. Negative None. Biotech Analyst The recent update from Mesoblast Limited regarding the FDA's position on their Phase 3 study data for remestemcel-L marks a significant milestone in the regulatory pathway for the company's treatment for pediatric SR-aGVHD. The FDA's readiness to consider the clinical data as sufficient for a BLA submission suggests a positive outlook for the therapy's approval. This is particularly noteworthy as SR-aGVHD is a serious condition where treatment options are limited and remestemcel-L could potentially meet an unmet medical need.Investors should note that the success of a BLA can significantly affect a biotech company's market valuation. The pediatric focus of the treatment also taps into a niche market, which could mean less competition and a strong demand if approved. However, it's important to remain cognizant of the fact that the FDA's final decision post-submission is not guaranteed and carries inherent risk. The company's intention to address product characterization issues in the next quarter is crucial, as any deficiencies could delay or even prevent approval.From a financial perspective, approval could lead to increased revenues for Mesoblast. However, investors should also consider the costs associated with the final stages of the regulatory process and potential market preparation activities. These costs can be substantial and their timing and magnitude will influence the company's financials. Healthcare Regulatory Expert The acknowledgment by the FDA that Mesoblast's clinical data is sufficient for a BLA submission is a testament to the rigor of their study MSB-GVHD001. For stakeholders, this is an encouraging development as it indicates that the company has likely met key efficacy and safety benchmarks. However, the term 'sufficient' does not equate to 'approval' and the FDA's final decision will hinge on a comprehensive review of the complete submission.It's important to understand that the BLA process is exhaustive and entails a thorough examination of not just clinical data but also manufacturing practices and product consistency. Mesoblast's focus on resolving product characterization issues will be a critical aspect of their resubmission. Any discrepancies in this area could lead to requests for additional information or even clinical trials, which can be time-consuming and costly.For the healthcare industry, the potential approval of remestemcel-L could set a precedent for similar allogeneic cellular therapies. The pediatric indication also highlights the FDA's commitment to advancing treatments for younger populations, which often face limited therapeutic options. Market Research Analyst The announcement from Mesoblast Limited is a positive development that could have implications for the broader market of treatments for inflammatory diseases. If remestemcel-L is approved, it could disrupt the current market dynamics by providing a new standard of care for pediatric SR-aGVHD patients. This could lead to shifts in market share among pharmaceutical companies within this therapeutic area.Market sentiment following such regulatory updates can have immediate effects on stock prices, as investors often react to perceived potential for future earnings. The pediatric indication of the therapy could allow Mesoblast to capitalize on orphan drug status benefits, which include market exclusivity periods, tax credits and waiver of certain FDA fees. These incentives can enhance profitability and provide competitive advantages.An approved therapy for SR-aGVHD in children could also have broader implications for the healthcare system, potentially reducing long-term healthcare costs associated with managing chronic complications of the disease. However, market penetration will depend on factors such as pricing, insurance coverage and the ability of Mesoblast to effectively market and distribute the product. 03/25/2024 - 10:34 PM NEW YORK, March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mesoblast Limited (Nasdaq:MESO; ASX:MSB), global leader in allogeneic cellular medicines for inflammatory diseases, today announced that U.S. FDA has informed the company that following additional consideration the available clinical data from its Phase 3 study MSB-GVHD001 appears sufficient to support submission of the proposed Biologics License Application (BLA) for remestemcel-L for treatment of pediatric patients with steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease (SR-aGVHD). “We thank the agency for their collaborative approach. The responses and guidance from FDA are clear and provide us with a high level of confidence to refile our BLA for remestemcel-L in children with SR-aGVHD,” said Mesoblast CEO Dr. Silviu Itescu. Mesoblast intends to file the resubmission during the next quarter, seeking to address all remaining product characterization issues. About Mesoblast Mesoblast (the Company) is a world leader in developing allogeneic (off-the-shelf) cellular medicines for the treatment of severe and life-threatening inflammatory conditions. The Company has leveraged its proprietary mesenchymal lineage cell therapy technology platform to establish a broad portfolio of late-stage product candidates which respond to severe inflammation by releasing anti-inflammatory factors that counter and modulate multiple effector arms of the immune system, resulting in significant reduction of the damaging inflammatory process.

As the brand's first full-size electric SUV concept, the Genesis Neolun Concept embodies the ultimate Genesis hospitality behind the wheel with an array of state-of-the-art technological features. The Genesis GV60 Magma Concept, within the wider Genesis Magma program, redefines the boundaries of performance and luxury, delivering an experience that ignites passion and exhilaration with every ride. Neolun: Futuristic Innovation Meets Warmth of Korean Hospitality The name ""Neolun"" is derived from the Greek ""neo,"" or new, and the Latin ""luna,"" which means moon. Together, it encapsulates Genesis' technological innovation that exceeds conventional standards and sets forth the brand's vision for the future. ""The Neolun Concept was inspired by Korea's iconic moon-shaped porcelain jars,"" said Genesis Chief Creative Officer Luc Donckerwolke. ""It's the epitome of timeless design and sophisticated craftsmanship."" The Neolun Concept's exterior revolves around the principle of ""reductive design"" — characterized by clean, refined lines that deliberately eliminate any unnecessary details. The most prominent exterior feature are the distinctive coach doors, without any B-pillars connecting the vehicle's body and roof. Compared to conventional vehicle structures, this layout provides a much more open interior space and maximizes convenient passenger access. Development of the B-pillarless coach doors has reached a level where its application to production vehicles is now feasible. The electric side steps are automatically deployed when the doors open, making it easier for passengers to step in and out of the vehicle. When the doors close, the side steps integrate back into the vehicle to maintain a seamless exterior design. The body-integrated lamps seamlessly blend with the vehicle's front and rear design, conveying strength and grandeur. In line with reductive design, the center high-mounted stop lamp is incorporated within an intricately detailed perforated pattern. The pop-up type roof rack accentuates the SUV identity of the Neolun Concept while harmonizing with the vehicle's sleek body line. The Neolun Concept stands out with a captivating two-tone scheme called ""Midnight Black"" and ""Majestic Blue,"" which takes after Korea's serene night sky and enhances the vehicle's elegant design. Interior-wise, the Neolun Concept's cabin represents a modern reinterpretation of Korea's distinct hospitality culture. From the moment passengers step through the B-pillarless coach doors, they are greeted by a spacious cabin that accentuates comfort and relaxation. Inspired by Korea's traditional ""ondol,"" the radiant heating system allows for efficient heating throughout the vehicle, with heating films applied to the dashboard, door trims, floor, seatbacks and console sides. Ondol is a Korean heating method that utilizes direct heat transfer underneath the floor to provide warmth, often found in traditional and modern homes throughout the country. The swiveling function of the front-row seats maximizes space and practicality for passengers, as the large adjustable display screen and the flexible display that unfolds from the rear-seat headliner offer a sensory-stimulating experience. The cashmere in the shade of ""Royal Indigo"" blends seamlessly with the vintage-inspired ""Purple Silk"" leather, which has been naturally dyed with organic pigments, setting a deeply relaxing mood. Completing the luxurious finish is the dark-colored real wood floor. The Neolun Concept's sound system features an advanced ""sound architecture"" that optimally places tweeters, midrange speakers, woofers and subwoofers for an immersive audio experience. Each speaker is strategically positioned to create a concert hall-like feel, ensuring that passengers enjoy unparalleled sound quality. As the speakers are activated, the crystal sphere at the front, designed to create an emotional connection between the driver and the car, rotates into a tweeter. Magma: High-Performance Meets Fun to Drive The Magma program adds a new dimension to Genesis, marking the brand's expansion into the realm of high-performance vehicles. Genesis ultimately aims to develop a high-performance Magma model for each production vehicle in the existing lineup, maximizing both aesthetics and performance. Revealed for the first time today, the GV60 Magma Concept will be among the Genesis Magma program models headed for production. ""Genesis Magma presents an exciting opportunity to push the boundaries of performance and luxury for new interpretations in high-performance vehicles, with the ultimate goal of developing models exclusive to Genesis,"" said Donckerwolke. ""The brand will continue to reveal experimental concepts with careful consideration of both technological and aesthetic elements. While speed and performance are important, the Genesis Magma program will look beyond, prioritizing the driving experience to kindle the joy of sporty driving with effortless comfort."" The GV60 Magma Concept elevates the design and performance of the existing GV60, Genesis' first dedicated EV model, with improved battery and motor technology. The concept car is the first step toward creating a deeper emotional connection between the driver and the vehicle. The GV60 Magma Concept's exterior design harmonizes aesthetics with considerations for chassis, aerodynamics and thermodynamics. To enhance stability during sporty driving, the car has been widened and lowered, giving it a more dynamic stance and allowing for a lower center of gravity. At the front, a wider and lower main air intake in the bumper effectively cools the batteries, motor and brakes, while the air curtains enhance the car's aerodynamic efficiency. Three stamped holes above the main air intake, inspired by the GV80 Coupe Concept and the G80 Magma Special, provide additional cooling. Added canards assist in generating downforce on the front axle. The enlarged fenders and integrated wheelhouse outlets help reduce kinetic energy and improve cooling for the brakes. The titanium-colored flow-formed 21-inch wheels feature integrated aero discs, which also help cool the brakes. On the roof, fins have been strategically placed to control the aerodynamic flow and channel it to the rear wing, generating rear downforce and ensuring aerodynamic fluidity. The GV60 Magma Concept's distinctive exterior design extends into the luxurious and sporty interior. It features elements including bucket seats with body-colored seatbacks, upholstered in nappa and suede leather featuring double-diamond stitching patterns in Magma's iconic orange color and titanium grey. ""The GV60 Magma Concept will deliver ample power, instilling customers with the confidence to drive with pure excitement and exhilaration,"" said Donckerwolke. Displayed alongside the GV60 Magma Concept today at Genesis House New York were the three other vehicles in the Magma program: GV80 Coupe Concept, G80 Magma Special and X Gran Berlinetta Concept. Unveiled for the first time in April 2023, the GV80 Coupe Concept is Genesis' first coupe SUV, and the first Genesis vehicle to have been presented in the Magma color. It was the vision for the production GV80 Coupe, launched last November. A select number of partner companies with expertise in high-performance vehicles have come together to develop the G80 Magma Special, an enhanced version of the G80 with improved driving performance. The G80 Magma Special will be exclusively available in the Middle East. Revealed last December in Barcelona, Spain, the X Gran Berlinetta Concept is the ultimate expression of the brand's high-performance car design potential. Racing legend Jacky Ickx, who was appointed Genesis Brand Partner in February, said he looks forward to lending his expertise to the Magma program during today's event, adding that he has always admired Genesis for its cultured elegance and design aesthetics. The GV60 Magma Concept, G80 Magma Special, X Gran Berlinetta Concept and Neolun Concept will be displayed alongside other Genesis production models at the 2024 New York International Auto Show, slated to open to the public on March 29 at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent announcement by Matador Resources Company regarding the pricing of an underwritten public offering of over 5 million shares is a strategic move aimed at raising capital. The estimated gross proceeds of approximately $347.3 million suggest a significant infusion of liquidity into the company's balance sheet. Such capital raises are often used to fund further exploration and production activities, pay down debt, or for general corporate purposes.Investors and analysts will be keen to understand the terms of the offering, such as the price per share compared to the current market price. A discount to the current market price could indicate a willingness by the company to ensure the offering's success at the expense of existing shareholders' value, while a price at or above market value could suggest strong demand and confidence in the company's future prospects. The impact on the stock market will largely depend on investor perception of the offering's terms and the intended use of the proceeds. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the offering by Matador Resources Company is a reflection of the company's growth strategy and its positioning within the energy sector. The oil and gas industry is capital intensive and companies frequently resort to the equity markets to secure the funds needed for expansion. The timing of such an offering can be critical and may be influenced by current market conditions, including oil prices and investor sentiment towards the energy sector.Analysts will monitor the aftermarket performance of Matador's stock to gauge the market's reception of the offering. A successful offering can also signal to the market that institutional investors have confidence in Matador's management and strategy, potentially attracting more attention to the stock. Economist From an economic standpoint, the capital raise by Matador Resources indicates an active investment phase for the company, which could have broader economic implications. The inflow of capital is expected to support business expansion, which could lead to job creation and increased economic activity in areas where the company operates. However, the dilution of existing shares may have a short-term negative impact on share value, which could affect shareholders' wealth and investment returns.Long-term, the success of such a capital investment is contingent upon the company's ability to leverage the additional funds to generate a return that exceeds the cost of capital. This is particularly pertinent in the volatile oil and gas sector, where price fluctuations can significantly affect profitability. 03/25/2024 - 08:45 PM DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Matador Resources Company (NYSE: MTDR) (“Matador”) announced today that it has priced an underwritten public offering of 5,250,000 shares of its common stock.

Financial Analyst The reported increase in total revenues by 3.2% for GreenTree Hospitality Group Ltd. reflects a modest growth trajectory, which is indicative of the company's resilience in a post-pandemic recovery phase. The positive shift from a net loss in the fourth quarter of 2022 to a net income in the same period in 2023 demonstrates an effective turnaround strategy, likely driven by operational improvements and cost management. The significant uptick in RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room) by 23.3% year-over-year is a strong performance metric for the hospitality sector, as it directly correlates with the company's revenue-generating efficiency.From an investor's standpoint, the growth in both hotel and franchised-and-managed revenues suggests a robust expansion strategy and the potential for scalable growth. However, the decline in restaurant revenues by 29.2% year-over-year, primarily due to the closure of L&O stores, raises concerns about the segment's stability and the company's strategic focus. The contrasting trends between the hotel and restaurant segments could indicate a need for portfolio rebalancing or a shift in operational focus.Furthermore, the reported gross profit increase and a gross margin improvement to 43.1% from 28.4% the previous year signals better cost efficiency and pricing power. Investors should monitor how these margins hold up in the face of potential economic headwinds and increased competition. The increase in net income and adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) suggests improved operational efficiency, but the decrease in adjusted EBITDA margin from 31.6% to 14.0% year-over-year may imply that the cost base has not scaled proportionally with revenue growth, which could be a point of concern. Market Research Analyst The hotel industry's recovery, as evidenced by GreenTree's performance, is a bellwether for the broader travel and hospitality sector in China. The company's reported increase in average daily room rates and occupancy rates is a positive sign of returning consumer confidence and spending power in the travel sector. The strategic expansion with a pipeline of 963 hotels under development is an aggressive growth move that could capture a larger market share as travel demand rebounds.However, the restaurant business's decline is not in line with industry trends where many dining establishments are experiencing a resurgence in patronage. This could suggest that GreenTree's restaurant portfolio may not be as well-aligned with current consumer preferences or facing operational challenges distinct from its hotel operations. The strategic focus on franchising might be a way to mitigate these challenges by leveraging local entrepreneurship and reducing direct operational risks.Investors should consider the company's dual-sector approach, as the contrasting performances between hotels and restaurants could offer a diversified risk profile. The growth in franchised-and-managed revenues and the expansion of the hotel footprint could provide a stable revenue stream, while the restaurant segment may require more strategic attention to harness its potential. Economist The financial results of GreenTree Hospitality Group Ltd. reflect broader economic trends, where the service sector is experiencing a post-pandemic rebound. The increase in hotel revenue aligns with the gradual normalization of travel and increased domestic tourism in China. The company's ability to increase RevPAR significantly is a testament to the recovering demand and possibly an optimized pricing strategy.On the other hand, the restaurant sector's performance, marked by a significant revenue decrease, could be influenced by a shift in consumer behavior or competitive dynamics within the industry. The closure of L&O stores may also reflect a strategic pivot or a response to market saturation and operational inefficiencies. The overall revenue growth, despite the restaurant segment's decline, indicates that the core hotel business remains the primary driver of financial performance.Investors should note the company's operational leverage, as evidenced by the improved income from operations and gross profit margins. The financial agility to turn a previous year's loss into a current year's profit suggests effective cost control measures and strategic realignment. However, the reduced adjusted EBITDA margin could imply that while the company is growing top-line revenues, it may be doing so at the expense of profitability, which could raise sustainability questions in the long-term. 03/25/2024 - 11:06 PM Total revenues increased by 3.2% year over year to RMB372.2 million (US$52.4 million)[1].Income from operations was RMB23.1 million (US$3.2 million) compared to RMB-5.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 .

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and core net income, as we present them, are useful financial metrics to assess our operating and financial performance before the impact of investing and financing transactions, income taxes and certain non-core and non-recurring items in our financial statements. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and core net income should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by other charges and gains we consider to be outside the ordinary course of our business. The use of Adjusted EBITDA and core net income has certain limitations because it does not reflect all items of income and expenses that affect our operations. Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and core net income are significant components in understanding and assessing our operating and financial performance. Depreciation and amortization expense for various long-term assets, income tax and share-based compensation have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. Each of these items should also be considered in the overall evaluation of our results. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA and core net income do not consider capital expenditures and other investing activities and should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. We compensate for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of our depreciation and amortization, interest expense/income, gains/losses from investments in equity securities, income tax expenses, share-based compensation, share of loss in equity investees, government subsidies and other relevant items both in our reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures and in our consolidated financial statements, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance. The terms Adjusted EBITDA and core net income are not defined under U.S. GAAP, and Adjusted EBITDA and core net income are not measures of net income, operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. When assessing our operating and financial performance, you should not consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for our net income, operating income or any other operating performance measure that is calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our Adjusted EBITDA and core net income may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and core net income or similarly titled measures utilized by other companies since such other companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA and core net income in the same manner as we do. Reconciliations of the Company's non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and core net income, to the consolidated statement of operations information are included at the end of this press release.

The Company plans to use the proceeds for acquisitions, including a portfolio of industrial properties in key U.S. markets. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent announcement by Terreno Realty Corporation regarding the upsized public offering of 5.5 million shares at $62.00 each is a strategic move aimed at capital expansion. The public offering, which is larger than the initially proposed 5 million shares, indicates a robust investor interest that could be attributed to the company's solid performance in the industrial real estate sector.Terreno's focus on major coastal U.S. markets positions it advantageously in areas with high demand for industrial spaces, primarily due to their proximity to major urban centers and logistics hubs. The planned use of the net proceeds for acquisitions and development projects is a growth-oriented approach that could potentially enhance the company's portfolio and revenue streams. However, the dilution of existing shareholders' equity is an inherent consequence of such public offerings. Investors should monitor the company's acquisition targets and the subsequent impact on its financial health and operational efficiency. Financial Analyst The offering price of $62.00 per share provides a reference point for the market's valuation of Terreno Realty Corporation's stock, which investors can compare against the company's historical price trends and future earnings potential. The decision to offer an additional 825,000 shares as an option to underwriters reflects confidence in the market's ability to absorb this significant influx of new shares without detrimental effects on the share price.It is worth noting that the involvement of reputable underwriters like Goldman Sachs and KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. could lend credibility to the offering and possibly attract institutional investors. The impact on the stock price in the short term could be volatile, as the market assimilates the new shares. Long-term effects will largely depend on the successful deployment of the capital raised towards accretive acquisitions and the realization of projected growth from development activities. Real Estate Investment Analyst Terreno Realty Corporation's targeted acquisition of a portfolio of industrial properties in key urban areas aligns with current trends that favor industrial real estate due to the e-commerce boom and the need for efficient supply chain management. The specific mention of New York City, Northern New Jersey, San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles indicates a strategic focus on markets with high barriers to entry and potentially higher yields.Investors should weigh the potential benefits of property acquisitions against the risks associated with property management and market fluctuations. The industrial real estate market has been performing well, but it is not immune to economic downturns or shifts in consumer behavior. The company's ability to integrate these properties and manage them effectively will be critical to the success of this capital raise. 03/25/2024 - 11:48 PM BELLEVUE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Terreno Realty Corporation (NYSE: TRNO) (the “Company”), an acquirer, owner and operator of industrial real estate in six major coastal U.S. markets, announced today the pricing of its public offering of 5,500,000 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $62.00 per share.

Conference call scheduled to discuss 2023 results on March 25, 2024, with replay options available for two weeks. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 75% year-over-year revenue growth for Rekor Systems is a strong indicator of the company's expanding market presence, particularly in the Urban Mobility and contactless compliance sectors. The substantial increase in contract values, by 124%, suggests a robust sales pipeline and potential for continued revenue growth. However, the Adjusted EBITDA loss, although reduced from the previous year, indicates that the company is still in a phase of investment and has yet to reach profitability. Investors should monitor the company's ability to convert increased contract values into profitable returns while maintaining operational efficiencies that have led to an improved Adjusted Gross Margin. Market Research Analyst Rekor's strategic focus on Urban Mobility and contactless compliance products aligns with the broader industry trend towards smart city solutions and automation. The reported increase in performance obligations suggests that the demand for Rekor's offerings is growing, which could lead to a sustainable competitive advantage. The company's avoidance of toxic debt and dilutive financing mechanisms is a prudent approach that may appeal to risk-averse investors, but it's important to consider the balance between financial health and the need for further investment to fuel innovation and growth in an increasingly competitive market. Technology Industry Analyst The emphasis on innovation, as stated by Rekor's CEO, is essential in the technology sector, especially for a company specializing in roadway intelligence technology. Rekor's significant Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 162% from 2018 to 2023 is impressive and showcases the company's rapid growth trajectory. However, as the company scales, it will be critical to continue investing in research and development to maintain its technological edge. The delay in the Investor and Analyst Day to share comprehensive updates might indicate strategic developments that could impact the company's future direction. 03/25/2024 - 04:05 PM Company Achieves Fourth Consecutive Quarter of Top Line Growth and Record RevenueCOLUMBIA, MD / ACCESSWIRE / March 25, 2024 / Rekor Systems, Inc.

During the twelve- and three-month period ended December 31, 2023, revenue attributable to our Urban Mobility product line increased $9,081,000 and $2,330,000, respectively, compared to the twelve- and three-month period ended December 31, 2022. Additionally, our contactless compliance revenue increased $1,110,000 and $391,000, respectively, for the twelve and three month period ended December 31, 2023, compared to the twelve and three month period ended December 31, 2022.The other main driver of revenue growth during the periods ended December 31, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022, was attributable to increased sales of the Company's software and hardware products.Cost of Revenue, excluding Depreciation and Amortization Year Ended December 31, Change Three Months Ended December 31, Change (Dollars in thousands)2023 2022 $ % 2023 2022 $ % Cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization$16,499 $10,890 $5,609 52% $5,180 $3,457 $1,723 50% For the year ended December 31, 2023, cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in personnel and other direct costs such as hardware that were incurred to support our increase in revenue.

This is an increase of approximately 23%, up from $21,412,000 of remaining performance obligations as of December 31, 2022.

Additionally, the Company has worked diligently to reduce its software and data costs.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAThe Company calculates EBITDA as net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The Company calculates Adjusted EBITDA as net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted for (i) impairment of intangible assets, (ii) loss on extinguishment of debt, (iii) stock-based compensation, (iv) losses or gains on sales of subsidiaries, and (v) other unusual or non-recurring items. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance or liquidity under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (""U.S. GAAP"") and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of our operating performance or as a measure of liquidity or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented because we believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of a company's ability to service and/or incur debt. However, other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do.The following table sets forth the components of the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods included (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2023 2022 Net loss from continuing operations $(45,685) $(83,454)Provision (benefit) for income taxes 32 (987)Interest expense, net 3,596 21 Depreciation and amortization 7,894 6,422 EBITDA $(34,163) $(77,998) Gain on extinguishment of debt $(527) $- Share-based compensation 4,352 6,616 Gain on the sale of ATSE - (2,643)Loss (gain) due to the remeasurement of the STS Earnout and Contingent Consideration, net 384 (883)Impairment of SAFE agreement 101 - Goodwill impairment - 34,835 Legal judgements and settlements 801 1,608 One-time consulting fees 365 1,024 Adjusted EBITDA $(28,687) $(37,441)Rekor has scheduled a conference call to discuss the 2023 results on Monday, March 25, 2024, at 4:30 P.M.

Market Research Analyst The announcement by Ideal Power of an underwritten public offering indicates a strategic move to raise capital, likely for furthering research, development and commercialization of their B-TRAN semiconductor power switch technology. It's important to note that the success of such an offering largely depends on market conditions and investor sentiment towards the company's growth potential and technological advancements.Investors should consider the implications of the additional 15% purchase option granted to the underwriter.

The market's response to the offering will be telling, as it reflects confidence in the company's value proposition and technology. The terms of the offering, including the price of the shares or warrants, will be significant in determining the immediate financial impact on the company and its investors.It's also worth monitoring the performance of Titan Partners Group as the sole book-running manager, which could influence the offering's success.

This uptick is a direct consequence of the company's commitment to the IMPAHCT trial and suggests an aggressive investment in the potential blockbuster treatment for PAH. With the completion of Phase 2b enrollment and the initiation of Phase 3, the company is nearing critical milestones that could substantially impact its valuation.However, investors should note the widening net loss from $51.5 million in 2022 to $75.5 million in 2023, which raises questions about the sustainability of Aerovate's spending rate despite the reported cash runway into 2026. The cash position, decreasing from $135.2 million in Q3 to $122.4 million at year's end, indicates a burn rate that will be closely monitored by stakeholders, as it informs both the company's ability to continue funding its trials and its need for future capital infusions. Medical Research Analyst From a clinical development perspective, the progression of AV-101 into Phase 3 of the IMPAHCT trial is a significant step for Aerovate. The seamless transition from Phase 2b to Phase 3 could expedite the overall timeline to potential approval. The direct inhalation method of delivering imatinib could represent a novel approach in the PAH treatment paradigm, potentially improving efficacy and patient compliance while reducing side effects.Given that PAH affects a relatively small patient population of approximately 70,000 in the US and Europe, AV-101's success could fill a niche yet high-value market segment. The anticipation of topline data from the Phase 2b trial in June 2024 will be a critical inflection point for the company, as positive results could lead to increased investor confidence and potentially attract partnership opportunities. Patent Attorney The expansion of Aerovate's intellectual property portfolio with two new patents in 2023 is a strategic move to protect their proprietary formulation and delivery method of imatinib. With a total of six issued patents, the company is creating a robust defense against potential competitors. Intellectual property is a critical asset in the biopharmaceutical industry and a strong portfolio can enhance a company's valuation and attractiveness to potential partners or acquirers.Moreover, the prosecution of additional applications to cover the product globally suggests a forward-thinking approach to securing market exclusivity beyond the U.S. This level of IP activity is often a positive indicator for investors, as it demonstrates a commitment to long-term market protection and revenue generation. 03/25/2024 - 04:10 PM Topline data expected in June 2024 from Phase 2b portion of the IMPAHCT global Phase 2b/Phase 3 clinical trial of AV-101 for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) Completed enrollment in the Phase 2b portion and enrolled first patient into the Phase 3 portion of the IMPAHCT trial of AV-101 in November 2023 Expanded intellectual property portfolio with two issued patents in 2023 Board of Directors expanded in 2023 with the addition of Donald Santel and Habib Dable, each a former CEO with PAH experience and significant product approval and launch expertise Cash runway into 2026, based on our current operating plan WALTHAM, Mass., March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aerovate Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: AVTE), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing drugs that meaningfully improve the lives of patients with rare cardiopulmonary disease, today announced financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, and recent business highlights. “Aerovate reached important milestones in 2023 with the achievement of full enrollment of the Phase 2b portion and the first patient enrolled in the Phase 3 portion of our IMPAHCT trial evaluating AV-101 for patients with PAH,” said Tim Noyes, Chief Executive Officer of Aerovate. “In 2024, we look forward to presenting baseline characteristics of IMPAHCT at the ATS international conference in May, as well as announcing Phase 2b topline data in June with the full Phase 2b clinical trial results to be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting. We remain confident that delivering our proprietary formulation of imatinib directly to the pulmonary vasculature via inhalation has the potential to achieve robust efficacy with a low side effect burden in PAH patients on two or three background therapies. As such, we continue to believe that AV-101 has the potential to be an important part of the future standard of care for PAH patients.” 2023 Highlights Enrollment Complete and Topline Data Expected in June 2024 from Phase 2b Portion of the IMPAHCT Global Phase 2b/Phase 3 Clinical Trial. IMPAHCT (Inhaled iMatinib Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Clinical Trial) is a global Phase 2b/Phase 3 trial of AV-101, our self-administered, twice daily dry powder inhaled formulation of the antiproliferative drug imatinib for the treatment of PAH. PAH is a devastating disease impacting approximately 70,000 people in the United States and Europe. In November 2023, we announced completion of enrollment at 202 adult patients in the Phase 2b portion of the IMPAHCT trial, and we continue to expect to provide topline data in June 2024. First Patient in Phase 3 Portion of IMPAHCT Enrolled in November 2023. Due to the seamless trial design, we were able to enroll our first patient in the Phase 3 portion of the IMPAHCT trial in the same month we completed enrollment in our Phase 2b portion of the IMPAHCT trial. Enrollment continues with over 120 clinical sites participating in the Phase 3 portion of the trial. The timing for topline Phase 3 data and the size of the Phase 3 portion of the trial will be determined based upon the results from the Phase 2b portion of the trial. Trial Data Published and Presented at Scientific Conferences. We presented at the American Thoracic Society (ATS) 2023 International Conference results in nonclinical species that (i) direct delivery of imatinib to the lungs demonstrated increased lung exposure compared with oral or IV dosing and (ii) the type of formulation impacted lung exposure with dry powder demonstrating greater lung exposure than suspension or solution and greater lung exposure versus oral or intravenous delivery. Expanded Intellectual Property Portfolio. We continued expanding our intellectual property portfolio in 2023 with the issuance of two additional patents bringing the total issued patents to six. In 2023, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued Patents 11,806,349 and 11,813,263 to us, and we continue prosecuting multiple additional applications to cover our product globally. Expanded Board of Directors with Experience in PAH. We appointed Habib Dable and Donald Santel to our Board of Directors. In March 2024, Mr. Dable was also appointed as Chair of our Board of Directors, as successor to Mark Iwicki, who remains a member of our Board. Mr. Dable is on three public biopharmaceutical company boards and was previously Chief Executive Officer of Acceleron Pharma Inc. at the time of its sale to Merck & Co., Inc. Mr. Santel serves on the board of directors of three biopharmaceutical companies and as chair of two of them. Mr. Santel previously served as Chief Executive Officer for CoTherix, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies for cardiopulmonary disease, including PAH. 2023 Financial Results Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $122.4 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $135.2 million as of September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by operational costs for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023. R&D expenses: Research and development (R&D) expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $64.2 million as compared to $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in R&D expenses was due primarily to clinical trial costs, manufacturing costs, and increased headcount-related costs in 2023 as compared to 2022. G&A expenses: General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $17.2 million as compared to $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in G&A expenses was due primarily to increased headcount-related costs, travel and other miscellaneous costs in 2023 as compared to 2022. Net loss: Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $75.5 million as compared to $51.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net loss included stock-based compensation expense of $11.9 million and $5.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Financial guidance: We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments will be sufficient to fund our operations into 2026, based on our current operating plan. About AV-101 AV-101 is an investigational, proprietary dry powder inhaled formulation of the antiproliferative drug imatinib. Developed specifically for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), AV-101 targets cellular hyperproliferation and resistance to apoptosis, driven by improper signaling in cells of the distal pulmonary arteries. By targeting the proliferation and accumulation of cells in the arteries of the lungs, we believe AV-101 has the potential to provide meaningful improvements for patients beyond the capabilities of currently approved therapies. AV-101 is designed for delivery by an easy-to-use dry powder inhaler, directly into the lungs to maximize potential clinical benefit and limit systemic adverse effects. Phase 1 results published in ERJ Open Research showed that AV-101 delivered by dry powder inhalation was generally well-tolerated by healthy adult volunteers with no serious adverse events reported. Aerovate has completed enrollment in the Phase 2b portion of the IMPAHCT clinical trial and is currently enrolling patients in the Phase 3 portion to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AV-101 in adults with PAH. About the IMPAHCT Trial IMPAHCT (Inhaled iMatinib Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Clinical Trial) is a multi-national, placebo-controlled Phase 2b/Phase 3 trial in adults with PAH that continuously enrolled patients as the study progresses from Phase 2b to Phase 3. The Phase 2b portion of the trial will evaluate three doses of AV-101 over 24 weeks, compared to placebo, to identify an optimal dose based on the primary endpoint, change in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and safety, tolerability, and other clinical measures. The Phase 3 portion of the trial will compare patients taking the optimal dose of AV-101, selected from the Phase 2b data, to placebo. The primary endpoint of the Phase 3 portion of the trial will be change in six-minute walk distance (6MWD) over 24 weeks versus placebo.

Sonoco Implementing Price Increase for Uncoated Recycled Paperboard in Europe,2024-03-25T20:07:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,Sonoco (SON) raises prices for uncoated recycled paperboard in Europe to counter higher input costs due to inflation and economic challenges.,"Sonoco Implementing Price Increase for Uncoated Recycled Paperboard in Europe Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Sonoco (SON) raises prices for uncoated recycled paperboard in Europe to counter higher input costs due to inflation and economic challenges. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement of Sonoco's price increase for uncoated recycled paperboard in Europe is a strategic response to the inflationary pressures and the economic climate that businesses are currently facing. This move is likely to have a ripple effect across the supply chain, impacting both customers and competitors.Companies in the packaging industry often operate on thin margins and any cost increase can significantly affect profitability. The decision to raise prices may be an attempt to maintain margins without compromising on quality or service. However, it's essential to monitor customer response, as price elasticity can vary. If demand is inelastic, the impact on volume might be minimal, leading to increased revenues. On the other hand, if customers are sensitive to price changes, there could be a shift towards alternative suppliers or materials, potentially leading to a decrease in market share for Sonoco.Competitors may also react by holding prices steady to gain market share or by following suit with increases of their own, which could lead to broader industry-wide price adjustments. The long-term effects of this pricing strategy will depend on these market dynamics, as well as the ability of Sonoco to effectively communicate the value proposition of their product to justify the higher price point. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Sonoco's decision to implement a price increase could indicate a proactive measure to protect its operating margins amid rising input costs. For investors, the key will be to assess how this price hike translates into Sonoco's financial performance in subsequent quarters.It's important to analyze the company's past ability to pass on increased costs to customers. A successful history of managing cost pass-through could suggest that Sonoco might mitigate the impact of inflation without significantly harming sales volume. Conversely, if the company has struggled in this area, the price increase could lead to a more pronounced decline in demand and thus, a potential dip in revenue.Additionally, investors should consider the timing of the price increase. With the effective date set for deliveries after mid-April, the impact will not be immediate but will be reflected in future financial statements. Close attention should be paid to the company's next earnings call and any guidance provided regarding the expected impact of the price adjustment on both top-line sales and net income. Economist The broader economic implications of Sonoco's price increase for uncoated recycled paperboard in Europe must be considered against the backdrop of general inflation and economic challenges. This decision could be symptomatic of broader inflationary trends that could lead to a decrease in consumer spending power and a potential slowdown in economic growth.Moreover, as companies like Sonoco pass on higher costs to their customers, there's a risk of contributing to a feedback loop that could exacerbate inflationary pressures. The packaging industry is integral to the distribution of a wide array of products and increased packaging costs could lead to higher prices for consumer goods, potentially dampening demand.It's also worth considering the potential impact on trade balances. If European customers turn to alternative markets for cheaper materials, this could affect the trade dynamics within the region. Conversely, if the price increase is indicative of a global trend, it may not result in significant shifts in trade patterns but rather a general rise in prices across the board. 03/25/2024 - 04:07 PM HARTSVILLE, S.C., March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sonoco (NYSE: SON) today announced it is implementing a €60 per ton, £50 for UK market, price increase for all grades of uncoated recycled paperboard (URB) sold in Europe effective for deliveries after 15th April 2024. “This price adjustment has become necessary to offset the higher input cost caused by general inflation and the current challenging economic climate,” said Nikolaj Thybo, Vice President Sales & Marketing Paper Europe. “We will continue to monitor the situation closely and take all action needed to support our customer base here in Europe.” Contact Information: Lisa Weeks Vice President of Investor Relations & Communications lisa.weeks@sonoco.com 843-383-7524 About Sonoco With net sales of approximately $6.8 billion in 2023, the Company has approximately 23,000 employees working in more than 300 operations around the world, serving some of the world’s best-known brands.

TMC expects to commence production offshore by the end of the first quarter of 2026. Key research campaigns evaluated seafloor ecosystem recovery post-nodule collection. TMC produced nickel sulfate from polymetallic nodules and signed an MoU with PAMCO. Industry updates include developments at the International Seabed Authority and U.S. Congress initiatives. Exploration and evaluation expenses decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, leading to a net loss improvement year over year. Negative None. Financial Analyst The Metals Company Inc.'s financial results for Q4 and FY 2023 indicate a significant net loss reduction from the previous year. This performance could be of interest to investors and market analysts monitoring the company's cost management and strategic direction. The reduction in net loss from $171 million in 2022 to $73.8 million in 2023 suggests improved operational efficiency or reduced expenses, which could be a positive signal for the company's financial health. However, the company's cash position at the end of the year, $6.8 million excluding subsequent financing, may raise concerns about its ability to sustain operations without additional funding.The credit facilities provided by affiliates and shareholders show confidence in the company's future but also highlight a reliance on external financing. The liquidity position, bolstered by these credit facilities, could provide the necessary capital for the company's planned upgrades and strategic initiatives. However, investors should be aware of the potential dilution effects and the increased financial risk associated with taking on debt.It's also worth noting the decrease in exploration and evaluation expenses, which could indicate a shift from a heavy investment phase into a more stable operational phase. This shift could be a pivotal point for the company as it moves towards commercial exploitation of seafloor resources. Environmental Policy Expert The environmental aspects of TMC's operations are noteworthy, particularly as they relate to the broader industry and regulatory landscape. The company's investment in research and the subsequent data collection in the NORI-D area suggest a proactive approach to addressing environmental concerns associated with seafloor polymetallic nodule collection. The observed state of the ecosystem post-collection and the company's anticipation of publishing findings in peer-reviewed literature are steps towards transparency and scientific validation of their activities.Furthermore, the company's engagement with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) and adherence to the Mining Code could set a precedent for environmental governance in deep-sea mining. This engagement is not only important for securing the necessary exploitation contracts but also for establishing TMC as a responsible actor in this emerging industry. The legislative developments, such as the Responsible Use of Seafloor Resources Act, indicate growing political interest in the sector, which could have implications for the company's social license to operate and potential regulatory challenges. Market Research Analyst The strategic partnerships and MoUs mentioned, such as the one with Pacific Metals Company of Japan (PAMCO), are indicators of TMC's market positioning and potential for revenue generation. The production of nickel sulfate from polymetallic nodules, a key component for battery markets, marks a significant milestone for the company. It showcases the potential to tap into the growing demand for battery metals driven by the electric vehicle and renewable energy sectors.However, the market for deep-sea minerals is still in its infancy and the long-term viability of this industry is contingent on technological, regulatory and market acceptance. The strategic moves by TMC, such as planned production capacity increases and the signing of MoUs, demonstrate an attempt to secure a first-mover advantage in the industry. Nevertheless, the actual demand for products derived from seafloor nodules and the competitive landscape will be critical factors in determining the company's market success. 03/25/2024 - 04:05 PM NEW YORK, March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TMC the metals company Inc. (Nasdaq: TMC) (“TMC” or “the Company”), an explorer of lower-impact battery metals from seafloor polymetallic nodules, today provided a corporate update and fourth quarter and full year financial results for the period ending December 31, 2023. Q4 2023 and FY 2023 Financial Highlights $15.2 million cash used in operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2023Net loss of $33.5 million and net loss per share of $0.11 for the quarter ended December 31, 2023For the full year 2023, a net loss of $73.8 million or $0.26 per share (compared to $171 million and $0.71 per share in 2022)Total cash on hand of approximately $6.8 million at December 31, 2023, excluding $9 million received in January 2024 as final payment from the Registered Direct Offering announced in August 2023Total pro forma liquidity of approximately $61 million at December 31, 2023, inclusive of: Cash of $6.8 million$9 million of additional gross proceeds received in January 2024 from the final payment in the Registered Direct OfferingThe undrawn $25 million unsecured credit facility from an affiliate of Allseas Group SA, the maturity date of which has been extended through August 2025An additional $20 million unsecured credit facility with a maturity date of September 22, 2025 provided by our largest shareholder, ERAS Capital LLC (the family office of TMC director Andrei Karkar), and our Chairman & CEO, Gerard Barron Gerard Barron, CEO & Chairman of The Metals Company commented: “Over the last 12 years, we’ve completed 22 offshore campaigns on the NORI-D area to build a data-driven picture of the marine environment and how it is impacted by nodule collection. NORI’s investment in research by the world’s leading deep-sea research institutions has produced the most comprehensive dataset ever collected in the CCZ and a fair bit of excitement among the researchers. Our latest campaign to assess the state of the ecosystem 12 months after the nodule collection pilot finished earlier this month, and the observed state of the seafloor ecosystem was encouraging. We believe we now have sufficient real-world data to address most of the concerns raised by those who oppose the industry, and we look forward to researchers publishing their findings in peer-reviewed literature and NORI submitting its Environmental Impact Statement to the International Seabed Authority (ISA). Perceptions of the environmental peril of nodule collection are starting to be publicly challenged by ocean scientists: it was exciting to see an influential group like the Breakthrough Institute publicly weigh into the debate.” “We are also encouraged by the pace of U.S. initiatives aimed at supporting domestic processing and refining of polymetallic nodules, as well as re-invigorated calls for the U.S. to ratify the Law of the Sea treaty and take advantage of Member State rights that come with the ratification. Meanwhile, two new applications for deep-sea mineral exploration have recently been submitted to the ISA by the government of India. With support for deep-sea minerals growing, I’m happy to provide additional financial flexibility to TMC in the form of a new unsecured credit facility alongside our director and largest shareholder Andrei Karkar, which is in addition to the existing and recently extended Allseas credit facility. As discussions with potential strategic partners continue, these significant sources of liquidity from our three largest shareholders will help ensure that we can deliver a world-class application for an exploitation contract following the July 2024 ISA session.” Operational Highlights Since Last Corporate Update Update to NORI-D Expected Timeline to First Production: We are currently focused on preparing our application to submit to the ISA for our first exploitation contract for NORI Area D following the July 2024 meeting of the ISA. We now expect to commence production offshore at the end of the first quarter of 2026, assuming an ISA review process of approximately one year from the submission of our application. This new estimated timeline to first production is based on: Refined assumptions following discussions with our strategic partner, Allseas, with respect to planned upgrades to the Hidden Gem (including an additional nodule collector vehicle and associated equipment) to increase maximum annual production capacity from 1.3 million wet tonnes to 3.0 million wet tonnes of nodules per annum while carefully ramping-up production in manageable increments over a 5-year period based on precautionary principles. These planned upfront upgrades to the Hidden Gem’s capacity, prior to the start of production, will help avoid a situation where the Hidden Gem would need to be taken out of the field to increase its nameplate production capacity from 1.3 to 3Mtpa.The latest consolidated ISA draft text of the rules, regulations and procedures the “Mining Code”) issued on February 16, 2024, describe an estimated review process on an application for an exploitation contract of 344 days, compared to previous versions which described a review process of 315 days. TMC Subsidiary NORI Concludes Key Offshore Research Campaign, Evaluating Seafloor Ecosystem Function a Year Post Nodule Collection Test: In December 2023, we announced the completion of one of the two offshore scientific research campaign to assess seafloor impacts and recovery rates twelve months after the pilot nodule collection system test conducted by NORI. NORI’s December offshore scientific research campaign successfully gathered crucial environmental data on ecosystem recovery and functioning to further support our application for a commercial exploitation contract, and the preliminary qualitative assessments are encouraging. NORI Shares Preliminary Findings on Environmental Impacts of Pilot Nodule Collection System Test: In November 2023, we began sharing emerging data on the impacts of seafloor sediment plumes, which show that the plume forms a gravity-driven turbidity current that hugs the contours of the seafloor and does not loft up into the water column where it could possibly be transported longer distances by ocean currents. A key component to understanding our environmental impacts, the data builds upon earlier laboratory predictions and in-field verifications from prior collector tests. First Nickel Sulfate Produced from Polymetallic Nodules: In March 2024, NORI produced what is believed to be the first nickel sulfate ever generated from polymetallic nodules. The sulfate, whose quality is indicative of material suitable for battery markets pending confirmation of preliminary assays, was produced in a program testing our efficient flowsheet design that processes intermediate nickel matte direct to nickel sulfate (without making nickel metal) and produces fertilizer byproducts instead of waste. Binding MoU with Pacific Metals Company of Japan (“PAMCO”): In November 2023, we signed a binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with PAMCO to process 1.3 million wet tonnes of nodules when commercial operations commence. PAMCO is planning a commercial sized pilot production run in the second quarter of 2024 in which 2,000 tonnes of nodules, collected during NORI’s mining test, will be processed at PAMCO’s existing rotary kiln-electric arc furnace (RKEF) plant. Industry Update International Seabed Authority: Part 1 of the ISA’s 29th Session is currently taking place between March 18-29, 2024, where the ISA Council will continue negotiations of the Mining Code. In February 2024, the ISA published a consolidated set of draft regulations for the first time, harmonizing and cleaning up the text. The 225-page text is comprehensive and signals the next phase in the negotiations. New ISA Exploration Applications from the government of India: In January 2024, the Government of India submitted two applications to the ISA for approval of two plans of work for exploration in the international seabed area (the Area) of the Indian Ocean. The Government of India already holds two contracts for exploration—one for polymetallic sulphides in the Central Indian Ocean Basin and another for polymetallic nodules in the Indian Ocean Ridge. Forthcoming Pentagon Report on Domestic Processing of Seafloor Nodules: In January 2024, we welcomed the passage of the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (“NDAA”) into law and the inclusion of provisions directing the U.S. Department of Defense to submit a report to the House Armed Services Committee assessing the domestic processing of seafloor polymetallic nodules. Thirty-One Members of the U.S. Congress Call Upon Pentagon to Develop Plan for Processing Deep-Sea Polymetallic Nodules: In December 2023, we welcomed a letter by thirty-one Members of the U.S. House of Representatives calling upon the U.S. Department of Defense to address the national security implications of deep-sea nodule collection as part of its mandate to ensure the stability and strength of critical minerals used for defense and clean energy technologies like batteries and renewable energy infrastructure. ~350 Former U.S. Political and Military Leaders Urge Senate to Ratify the Law of the Sea: In March 2024, an influential group of former U.S. government officials and military officers — including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta — urged U.S. Senators to ratify the Law of the Sea Treaty (UNCLOS), so “The United States can take its seat on the Council of the International Seabed Authority”, and pursue deep sea mining sites “each containing a trillion dollars in value.” Responsible Use of Seafloor Resources Act (RUSRA): In March 2024, legislation was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives calling for the U.S. to “support international governance of seafloor resource exploration and responsible polymetallic nodule collection by allied partners”, and to “provide financial, diplomatic, or other forms of support for seafloor nodule collection, processing and refining.” Financial Results Overview At December 31, 2023, we held cash of approximately $6.8 million and held no financial debt. We believe that our cash on hand, and borrowing availability under our recently amended and extended credit facility with an affiliate of Allseas, and our recently announced credit facility with ERAS Capital LLC and Mr. Barron, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure commitments for at least the next twelve months from today. We reported a net loss of approximately $33.5 million, or $0.11 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to net loss of $109.6 million, or $0.41 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Exploration and evaluation expenses during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 were $26.7 million compared to $81.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The significant decrease in the exploration and evaluation expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 reflects a reduction in environmental studies costs as the collector test was completed in 2022, partially offset by the monitoring work in the NORI Area D following the collector test which was carried out in the fourth quarter of 2023, a reduction in the pilot mining test system (“PMTS”) cost and a reduction in share based compensation cost as the cost of the Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) options with specific market capitalization vesting conditions were fully amortized in 2022. In addition, the last quarter of 2022 included a charge of $69.9 million on the fair value of the exercise of the warrant held by Allseas. The reduction in these costs in 2023 was partially offset by an increase in engineering work to advance the NORI project, an increase in exploration labor costs mainly attributable to an increase in headcount and an increase in the cost of prefeasibility work. General and administrative expenses were $6.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 compared to $7.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, reflecting lower share-based compensation in the 2023 period, as LTIP options with specific market capitalization vesting conditions were fully amortized in 2022, partially offset by higher spending on consulting and advisory work. We reported a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 of $73.8 million, or $0.26 per share, compared to net loss of $171.0 million, or $0.71 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2022. Exploration and evaluation expenses during the year ended December 31, 2023 were $49.8 million compared to $144.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. General and administrative expenses in 2023 were $22.5 million compared to $29.5 million in 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded total share-based compensation expenses of $9.2 million ($17.1 million in 2022) of which $5.1 million was recorded in exploration and evaluation expenses ($8.5 million in 2022) and $4.1 million was recorded in general and administrative expenses ($8.6 million in 2022).

Amneal Receives U.S. FDA Approval for Ciprofloxacin and Dexamethasone Otic Suspension,2024-03-25T20:05:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AMRX) receives FDA approval for ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone otic suspension, a new high-value product for treating ear infections. The product is indicated for Acute Otitis Externa in pediatric, adult, and elderly patients.","Amneal Receives U.S. FDA Approval for Ciprofloxacin and Dexamethasone Otic Suspension Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags fda approval Rhea-AI Summary Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AMRX) receives FDA approval for ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone otic suspension, a new high-value product for treating ear infections. The product is indicated for Acute Otitis Externa in pediatric, adult, and elderly patients. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Analyst Amneal Pharmaceuticals' recent FDA approval for ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone otic suspension marks a strategic advancement in its generics portfolio. The product's dual components, antibacterial and corticosteroid, address a niche but essential healthcare need for treating Acute Otitis Externa. The approval signals Amneal's ability to navigate the complex regulatory landscape, which is pivotal for the company's growth trajectory in the generics market.From a financial perspective, such approvals can lead to increased revenue streams. Generics typically offer lower margins than branded drugs, but they can achieve significant volume sales. For investors, this approval could be seen as a positive indicator of Amneal's potential to capture market share in the otic therapy space, which in turn could influence the company's stock performance positively. However, the extent of impact on the stock market would depend on the product's market penetration and the competitive landscape. Healthcare Market Analyst The approval of Amneal's ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone otic suspension is an important event for both the company and the market for otic treatments. The combination of a fluoroquinolone with a corticosteroid addresses the need for potent anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects in treating ear infections. As a generic, it offers a cost-effective alternative to branded medications, potentially disrupting the current market dynamics.Long-term implications for the healthcare industry include potential shifts in prescribing patterns, with cost-containment efforts by insurers and healthcare providers favoring generics. This could lead to a broader impact on the market as other companies may follow suit, increasing competition and driving innovation. For stakeholders, understanding the balance between the demand for affordable treatments and the profitability of generic drug manufacturing is essential. Investment Analyst The introduction of a high-value generic such as Amneal's ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone otic suspension can have a ripple effect on the stock market within the pharmaceutical sector. Generics are known to quickly erode the sales of their branded counterparts post-patent expiry, leading to a reshuffling of market shares. This approval could potentially attract investor interest towards Amneal, reflecting confidence in the company's R&D and regulatory capabilities.Investors should monitor Amneal's execution of the product launch, market uptake and any competitive responses. It's also important to consider the overall market size for AOE treatments and the penetration rate Amneal achieves. While the immediate financial impact may be limited, the strategic significance lies in the diversification of Amneal's portfolio towards more complex generics, which could enhance its valuation over time. 03/25/2024 - 04:05 PM - Product references branded Ciprodex - Represents another complex, high value new product BRIDGEWATER, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Spire Global Announces Closing of $30 Million Registered Direct Offering,2024-03-25T20:05:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Spire Global, Inc. (SPIR) closes registered direct offering, raising $30 million in gross proceeds with an option for additional $31 million.

(SPIR) closes registered direct offering, raising $30 million in gross proceeds with an option for additional $31 million. Net proceeds to be used for debt repayment, working capital, and corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Spire Global's recent completion of a registered direct offering at $14.00 per share, with the potential to raise additional funds through an options agreement, is a strategic move to bolster its financial position. The offering's success, accumulating approximately $30 million in gross proceeds, reflects investor confidence in Spire's business model and growth prospects. The option for investors to acquire additional shares at $14.50 could lead to further capital inflow of approximately $31 million, which is a savvy incentive mechanism to maintain investment interest over the next 100 days.From a financial perspective, the use of proceeds for debt repayment is a prudent decision, potentially improving the company's balance sheet and creditworthiness. Allocating funds to working capital and general corporate purposes suggests an agenda for sustainable growth. However, investors should monitor the company's subsequent financial disclosures to assess the effectiveness of these allocations in driving value creation. Market Research Analyst The space-based data and analytics sector is witnessing a surge in demand, driven by advancements in technology and an increased reliance on satellite data across industries. Spire Global's capital raise through a direct offering positions the company to capitalize on this growth trend. The offering's timing and pricing strategy are critical factors that could influence the company's market share and competitive edge.Investors should note that the direct offering bypasses the traditional underwriting process, potentially reducing the time to market and offering expenses. However, the fixed pricing at $14.00 and $14.50 per share could be a double-edged sword, depending on market volatility and investor sentiment in the short term. The company's future performance in leveraging the raised capital towards innovative solutions and customer acquisition will be key to its long-term success in the industry. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding this transaction, including the use of an effective shelf registration statement and the SEC's involvement, ensures regulatory compliance and transparency for investors. The offering's structure, including the option to purchase additional shares, is crafted to adhere to securities laws and protect both the company and its investors.It is important for potential investors to understand the legal implications and restrictions of such offerings, particularly the limitations on sales in certain jurisdictions and the conditions under which the options may be exercised. Vigilance towards the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus is important for informed investment decisions, as these documents detail the terms, risks and future plans of the company. 03/25/2024 - 04:05 PM VIENNA, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Spire Global, Inc.

OpGen Announces Acquisition of Preferred Stock by David Lazar,2024-03-25T20:05:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"OpGen secures $3 million investment from David Lazar, appoints new board of directors, and settles outstanding liabilities with EIB. Lazar to become CEO.","OpGen Announces Acquisition of Preferred Stock by David Lazar Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary OpGen secures $3 million investment from David Lazar, appoints new board of directors, and settles outstanding liabilities with EIB. Lazar to become CEO. Positive David Lazar invests $3 million in OpGen through Series E Preferred Stock purchase. Proceeds to be used to repay outstanding debts and for general corporate purposes. Lazar appointed to OpGen's Board of Directors and will take over as CEO. OpGen settles outstanding liabilities with EIB and Curetis GmbH through financing. Settlement agreements reached with EIB and Curetis trustee to clear debts. Shares of Series E Preferred Stock convertible into OpGen's common stock. New board members appointed to enhance corporate governance. Strategic options to drive shareholder value to be explored under new leadership. Negative None. Financial Analyst The infusion of $3 million in preferred stock by David Lazar into OpGen represents a significant capital injection aimed at stabilizing the company's financial position. By addressing outstanding debts with the European Investment Bank and Curetis GmbH, OpGen is effectively restructuring its balance sheet, which could lead to improved financial ratios and potentially better credit terms in the future. This move may be viewed positively by investors as it signals a commitment to financial health and could reduce the risk of insolvency.Furthermore, the conversion feature of the Series E Preferred Stock introduces a potential future dilution of common stock, which shareholders should monitor closely. The conversion rate of 1:24 suggests a significant increase in the number of shares outstanding if fully converted, which could impact the stock price and existing shareholders' equity.Lastly, the appointment of David Lazar as CEO and the reshuffling of the board could lead to strategic shifts within the company. Lazar's statement about exploring strategic options to drive shareholder value might indicate potential mergers, acquisitions, or divestitures on the horizon. Stakeholders should track the strategic moves closely, as they could affect the company's direction and stock performance. Market Research Analyst OpGen's settlement of liabilities and the subsequent leadership changes are likely to alter market perception of the company. The market typically responds favorably to reductions in debt and clear plans for future growth, which could be the case here if the new leadership team successfully communicates and implements a compelling strategic vision.Additionally, the life sciences sector, where OpGen operates, is highly competitive and sensitive to innovation and regulatory changes. The new board's ability to navigate these challenges while capitalizing on the company's strengths will be critical for long-term success. Investors will be interested in the new CEO's approach to harnessing the company's assets, including the Curetis and Ares Genetics businesses and how these could be leveraged for growth or monetization. Corporate Governance Expert The complete overhaul of OpGen's board and the appointment of a new CEO are indicative of a major governance shift. Such changes can be disruptive, but they can also bring fresh perspectives and strategies to a company. It is essential for investors to assess the track record of the incoming board members and CEO to gauge their potential impact on the company's governance and strategic direction.Moreover, the swift resignation of the entire previous board raises questions about the circumstances leading to this transition. While not uncommon in cases of significant investment and change in control, it is important for the new leadership to maintain transparency and clear communication with shareholders to build trust and support for the new direction. 03/25/2024 - 04:05 PM David Lazar invests $3 million in Preferred StockNew OpGen Board of Directors appointedDavid Lazar will take over as CEO of OpGenOpGen settles outstanding liabilities with EIB ROCKVILLE, Md., March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OpGen, Inc.

The conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock into shares of common stock in excess of applicable statutory and regulatory thresholds, including national stock exchange rules, will be subject to receipt of stockholder approval for the issuance of such shares of Common Stock. In connection with the transactions, Mr. Lazar was also appointed to the Board of Directors of OpGen, and following closing will be appointed CEO. In addition, effective as of the initial closing, each of the prior members of the Company’s board of directors resigned and Oliver Schacht, PhD, resigned as CEO.

With Curetis and Ares Genetics businesses and assets being sold by the respective trustees in Germany and Austria to strategic acquirors, this financing transaction provides an opportunity for OpGen to settle its outstanding liabilities with its major creditors.

The company is working on improving financial flexibility through asset disposition proceeds and prioritizing projects for working capital enhancement and new product acceleration. Quantum is re-evaluating its application of ASC 606, causing delays in filing Form 10-Qs for fiscal quarters. Positive None. Negative Quantum faces non-compliance with Nasdaq's $1.00 bid price requirement, necessitating a hearing for a possible extension. Delays in filing Form 10-Qs due to re-evaluation of ASC 606 may impact investor confidence. Financial Analyst The situation described with Quantum Corporation highlights a critical juncture in the company's efforts to maintain its listing status on the Nasdaq Global Market. The non-compliance with the $1.00 bid price requirement presents a tangible risk to the company's stock liquidity and investor perception. The request for a hearing and an additional 180-day extension to meet listing requirements indicates a proactive approach by management to address these compliance issues. However, the uncertainty surrounding the Panel's decision adds a layer of risk for current and potential investors.Furthermore, the amendment to the company's term loan credit and security agreement, aimed at improving financial flexibility, suggests a strategic move to strengthen the balance sheet. The focus on the pay-down of existing debt is a positive sign that management is taking steps to improve the company's financial health. This could potentially be seen as a positive indicator by the market, as it may lead to a more sustainable capital structure in the long run. Accounting Standards Expert The re-evaluation of the standalone selling price under ASC 606 is a significant accounting undertaking that reflects Quantum's commitment to accurate financial reporting. ASC 606, which deals with revenue from contracts with customers, requires a detailed and methodical approach to recognize and measure revenue. The delayed filing of the Form 10-Qs indicates that Quantum is facing complexities in its revenue recognition practices, which could have material implications for its reported financial performance.The extensive analysis of current and historical financial data to ensure compliance with ASC 606 may result in restatements of past financial statements, which could impact investor confidence and the company's market valuation. It is imperative for stakeholders to monitor the outcome of this re-evaluation process closely, as it will likely provide a clearer picture of the company's true financial position and performance. Market Research Analyst Quantum's current predicament is reflective of the broader challenges faced by companies operating in the high-tech sector where rapid innovation and product development cycles are important for maintaining competitive advantage. The emphasis on accelerating new products and focusing the business suggests a strategic pivot that may be necessary to stay relevant in the dynamic tech industry. However, the success of such a strategy is contingent upon the company's ability to execute effectively while also navigating the financial and compliance hurdles it currently faces.Investors and market observers should consider the potential long-term benefits of Quantum's strategic initiatives against the backdrop of current compliance and financial challenges. The company's ability to emerge from this period with a stronger product portfolio and improved financial health could position it well for future growth, but the inherent uncertainties in this process cannot be overlooked. 03/25/2024 - 04:05 PM SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Quantum Corporation (Nasdaq: QMCO) (""Quantum"" or the ""Company""), the pioneer in end-to-end data management solutions designed for the AI era, today filed a Form 8-K regarding several business updates, including reiterating its efforts to be current with its SEC financial reports by May 7, 2024. On March 19, 2024, the Company received a letter (the “Letter”) from the listing qualifications staff (the “Staff”) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) regarding the Company’s non-compliance with the $1.00 bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rules 5450(a)(1). Accordingly, the Company requested a hearing in response to the Letter to present to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) its plan to comply with all applicable requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq and request an additional 180-day extension to do so. Although there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company’s request for an extension, the Company is diligently working to comply with all of the applicable Nasdaq listing criteria within the period of time that the Panel may grant. Also as part of today’s news, Quantum filed a Form 8-K regarding an amendment to the Company’s term loan credit and security agreement, which stipulates that proceeds related to the disposition of assets be used to improve financial flexibility, including the pay-down of existing debt. This amendment is consistent with the Company’s broader efforts to prioritize certain financial and business projects targeting improvements to working capital, acceleration of new products and a more focused business. As previously disclosed, the Company is in the process of re-evaluating its application of standalone selling price under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (""ASC 606"") that has resulted in the delayed filing of its Form 10-Qs for the second and third fiscal quarters of fiscal year ending March 31, 2024. This re-evaluation process has involved an extensive and detailed analysis of the current financial periods as well as historical quarterly and annual reports. Although the Company, along with its independent registered public accounting firm, is making significant progress, additional time is being taken in order to make a final determination.

The data show improvements in cognitive function, CSF, and plasma Tau proteins, with no adverse events reported. The trial demonstrated potential clinical activity in AD patients, with promising results on biomarkers and cognitive scores. Positive Positive Phase 1 trial data presented at Tau2024 Global Conference Improvements in cognitive function, CSF, and plasma Tau proteins observed No treatment-related adverse events reported Potential clinical activity in Alzheimer's disease patients shown Promising results on biomarkers and cognitive scores Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The data from NKGen Biotech's Phase 1 trial of SNK01 in Alzheimer's disease patients presents a promising development in the field of neurodegenerative disease treatment. Specifically, the improvement in cognitive scores and the reduction of Tau proteins in both cerebral spinal fluid and plasma are significant because Tau proteins are implicated in the neurofibrillary tangles that are a hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology. The ability of SNK01 to cross the blood-brain barrier, as suggested by the data, is particularly noteworthy. This characteristic is a important challenge for many therapies targeting brain conditions due to the protective nature of this barrier.From a medical research perspective, the use of autologous NK cell therapy is a relatively new approach in treating Alzheimer's disease. The immune system's role in neurodegeneration is a growing area of interest, with NK cells being a type of immune cell that could have potential in modulating disease progression. The safety profile mentioned, with no treatment-related adverse events observed, is encouraging for the continued development of this therapy. However, it's important to note that this is early-stage research and the sample size of the trial is small. The longer and larger Phase 1/2a trial will be critical in validating these preliminary findings. Biotech Industry Analyst The announcement by NKGen Biotech regarding their Phase 1 clinical trial results for SNK01 could have implications for the company's valuation and investor sentiment. The biotech sector is highly sensitive to clinical trial outcomes, especially for treatments targeting diseases like Alzheimer's, which have a significant unmet medical need and a large potential market. The positive results could lead to increased investor interest and potentially drive up NKGen Biotech's stock price in the short term.However, the long-term impact on the company's financials will depend on the outcomes of subsequent trials, regulatory approvals and the therapy's commercial viability. The fact that the company is moving towards a higher dosing and prolonged regimen in their Phase 1/2a trial indicates confidence in the treatment's potential and could signal a strategic move to position SNK01 as a disease-modifying treatment in a market that is currently limited in such options. Investors will be closely monitoring the progress of the larger trial for more definitive data that could solidify the company's standing in the biotech industry. Neurologist The reported Phase 1 clinical trial results of SNK01 show potential in addressing cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, which is a significant concern for clinicians and patients alike. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) are widely used cognitive assessments in clinical settings and improvements or stability in these scores are promising. The reported changes in Tau protein levels are also of clinical interest, as these biomarkers are associated with disease progression.As a neurologist, the data suggesting that SNK01 may reduce levels of pathological Tau and potentially improve cognitive function is intriguing. However, it is important to remain cautious until larger and more extensive trials are conducted. The complex nature of Alzheimer's disease, with its multifactorial pathogenesis, means that treatments must be thoroughly vetted through rigorous clinical testing. The safety and tolerability of SNK01, as reported, are positive, but efficacy and long-term safety must be established in larger, controlled studies. The next phases of clinical trials will be pivotal in determining whether this therapy could be integrated into clinical practice. 03/25/2024 - 04:05 PM SNK01 autologous NK cell therapy demonstrated a positive effect on cerebral spinal fluid (“CSF”) and plasma Tau proteins in Alzheimer’s patients. The additional Phase 1 SNK01 trial data suggest clinical activity regarding cognitive function in patients with advanced Alzheimer’s disease in addition to previously disclosed positive effects on amyloid protein and neuroinflammation biomarkers. SANTA ANA, Calif., March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NKGen Biotech, Inc. (Nasdaq: NKGN) (“NKGen” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative autologous, allogeneic, and CAR-NK Natural Killer (“NK”) cell therapeutics, today presented additional Phase 1 clinical trial data on the use of its investigational autologous NK cell therapy, SNK01, to treat patients with Alzheimer’s disease (“AD”) at the Tau2024 Global Conference in Washington, D.C. The presentation contained data from an abstract entitled, “Beneficial Effect on CSF and Plasma Tau Proteins and Cognitive Function in Alzheimer’s Disease Subjects Treated with Expanded Non-Genetically Modified Autologous Natural Killer Cells (SNK01).” In this Phase 1 study, SNK01 was administered intravenously (“IV”) every three weeks for a total of four treatments using a 3+3 dose escalation design (1, 2, and 4 x 109 cells) in patients with either mild, moderate, or severe AD (Median MMSE of 14). Cognitive assessments and CSF/plasma pTau217 and pTau181 analyses were performed at baseline and at 1 and 12 weeks after the final dose. The primary endpoint was safety and secondary endpoints included changes in cognitive assessments and biomarker levels. “The data presented today demonstrate additional beneficial effects of SNK01 for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease,” commented Paul Y. Song, M.D., CEO of NKGen. “The data from this Phase 1 trial further validates the ability of SNK01 to improve pTau, amyloid Aβ42/40, and alpha-synuclein biomarkers as well as improving cognitive scores, consistent with what we have previously observed. While the results were positive, the Phase 1 trial was a dose-escalation trial that only administered four total doses over 11 weeks. However, our Phase 1/2a SNK01 trial in moderate Alzheimer’s patients, initiated in December 2023, utilizes a 50% higher dose than the highest dose administered in the prior Phase 1, and prolonged dosing regimen for over one year in which we expect to show an even greater clinical benefit. We are excited to continue our research with the goal of offering our NK cell therapy to patients with Alzheimer’s disease who are in need of disease modifying treatments.” Highlights from the Presentation: Of the 11 patients enrolled, 10 were evaluable – median MMSE was 14.SNK01 given via a simple IV appears to cross the blood brain barrier to improve Aβ42/40, Tau, and alpha-synuclein protein levels in CSF.Despite 70% of patients treated at relatively low doses of SNK01, at one-week post-treatment (week 11): 50–70% of all enrolled patients in the trial had either stable or improved CDR-SB, ADAS-Cog and/or MMSE scores including one patient whose MMSE score improved from 14 to 23.90% had either stable or improved ADCOMS scores.50% of patients had a decrease in CSF pTau217.80% had stable/decreased CSF pTau181 compared to baseline values.30% had a decrease in plasma pTau217. 40% had a decrease in plasma pTau181. Where data were available, this decrease continued through week 22 (12 weeks after the last dose) for CSF pTau217 for all patients (n=4), for CSF pTau181 for 5/7 patients, for plasma pTau217 for 2/3 patients, and for plasma pTau181 for 3/4 patients. At week 11, the percent of patients with a stable/improved ADCOMS score who also had a decrease in CSF pTau was 56% for pTau217 and 78% for pTau181.No treatment related adverse events were observed.SNK01 appears safe and well tolerated and the data suggest SNK01 may have potential clinical activity in AD while also reducing CSF and plasma Tau protein levels. A larger trial with a higher dosing/duration was initiated in the U.S. in 2023. A copy of the abstract and presentation materials will be available on the Scientific Publications page of the Company’s website at https://nkgenbiotech.com/ once the presentation has concluded. Previously disclosed Phase 1 data on the positive effects of SNK01 on amyloid and neuroinflammation biomarkers, which are not included in this Tau-focused conference presentation, can also be found on the Scientific Publications page.

Live conference call scheduled for March 26, 2024, to discuss financial results and operational highlights. Negative None. Financial Analyst The performance of Sanara MedTech Inc. is noteworthy for stakeholders and potential investors, as it reflects a significant turnaround in terms of revenue generation and loss reduction. The 42% increase in net revenue in 2023 compared to the previous year indicates a robust growth trajectory, likely driven by strategic product expansion and market penetration. It's important to assess the sustainability of this growth, considering the competitive landscape of the medical technology sector.Furthermore, the reduction of the net loss from $8.1 million in 2022 to $4.4 million in 2023 and a breakeven Adjusted EBITDA, suggests improved operational efficiency. However, the increase in SG&A costs and R&D expenses could indicate that the company is investing in future growth, which may impact short-term profitability but could be beneficial in the long term if these investments lead to innovative products and market expansion. Medical Research Analyst The introduction of new products like ALLOCYTE Plus and BIASURGE and the acquisition of CellerateRX assets, are pivotal in Sanara's portfolio diversification. The retrospective study showing a 59% reduction in surgical site infections with CellerateRX is a strong endorsement of the product's clinical efficacy. This could enhance the product's marketability and adoption in surgical settings, potentially leading to increased sales.Moreover, the exclusive license agreement with Tufts University for 18 unique peptides could be a game-changer for the CellerateRX platform, signifying Sanara's commitment to innovation. The long-term implications here hinge on the successful development and commercialization of these peptides, which could offer substantial competitive advantage and open new revenue streams. Market Research Analyst The expansion of Sanara's product distribution to over 1,000 facilities and the approval for sale in more than 3,000 hospitals/ambulatory surgery centers is a testament to the company's effective market strategy. The medical technology market is highly competitive and Sanara's ability to secure such widespread distribution is an indicator of strong market demand and effective sales execution.Understanding the competitive landscape and Sanara's position within it is essential. The company's strategic focus on products that improve clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare costs is aligned with the broader industry trend towards value-based care. As healthcare providers continue to seek cost-effective and outcome-improving solutions, Sanara's product portfolio appears well-positioned to meet these needs. 03/25/2024 - 04:05 PM FORT WORTH, TX, March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sanara MedTech Inc. Based in Fort Worth, Texas, Sanara MedTech Inc. (“Sanara,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) (NASDAQ: SMTI), a medical technology company focused on developing and commercializing transformative technologies to improve clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare expenditures in the surgical, chronic wound and skincare markets, announced today its strategic, operational and financial results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Zach Fleming, Sanara's CEO, stated, “During 2023, the Sanara team achieved several key strategic and operational milestones that position the Company for continued strong growth in 2024. These achievements included the acquisition of key assets related to CellerateRX® Surgical Powder and Gel (“CellerateRX”) and the launch of our new ALLOCYTE® Plus Advanced Viable Bone Matrix product (“ALLOCYTE Plus”) while also commercializing BIASURGE® Advanced Surgical Solution (“BIASURGE”). I am grateful to our entire team for their dedication to advancing our goal of developing and commercializing technologies that improve outcomes and reduce costs throughout the U.S.” Strategic and Operational Highlights in the Fourth Quarter 2023 In the fourth quarter 2023, the Company generated a record $17.7 million in sales, representing a ninth record revenue quarter for the Company.For the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company had a net loss of $0.3 million, compared to a net loss of $4.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The Company was breakeven on an Adjusted EBITDA* basis for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to negative Adjusted EBITDA* of $2.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022.During the trailing twelve-month period, the Company’s products were sold in over 1,000 facilities across 34 states plus the District of Columbia. The Company’s products were contracted or approved to be sold in more than 3,000 hospitals/ambulatory surgery centers as of December 31, 2023.In October 2023, Sanara recorded its first sale of ALLOCYTE® Plus, a human cell and tissue-based product. Sanara believes it has a sufficient supply of ALLOCYTE Plus to meet currently expected demand and that it has measures in place to regularly stock the product in the future.First sales of BIASURGE® occurred in early November 2023. The Company believes that BIASURGE’s biocompatibility, efficacy and ability to be left in a wound without a secondary rinse creates a unique combination and will be a market differentiator. Additionally, the Company believes this product can be used in any surgery where Sanara products are currently used.In November 2023, Sanara announced the publication of a retrospective study involving 5,335 patients. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of activated collagen (CellerateRX® Surgical Powder) in promoting surgical wound healing. Specifically, a significant decrease in surgical site infections was observed, exhibiting a significant reduction in surgical site infection rates (59%) among patients undergoing elective surgery. This reduction was most pronounced in clean cases, with a 69% decrease in surgical site infection rates.In December 2023, the Company signed an exclusive license agreement with Tufts University to develop and commercialize patented technology covering 18 unique peptides, which Sanara envisions will strategically advance the CellerateRX platform. Full Year 2023 Sales Analysis In 2023, Sanara had sales growth across all major product lines. The Company continues to hire experienced and talented sales managers to drive growth in new territories while also working to increase product sales in existing accounts and expand usage in new specialty areas. For the year ended December 31, 2023, Sanara generated net revenues of $65.0 million compared to net revenues of $45.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a 42% increase from the prior year. The higher net revenue in 2023 was primarily due to increased sales of soft tissue repair products (CellerateRX, FORTIFY TRG® Tissue Repair Graft, FORTIFY FLOWABLE® Extracellular Matrix, and TEXAGEN® Amniotic Membrane Allograft) and bone fusion products (BiFORM® Bioactive Moldable Matrix, AMPLIFY™ Verified Inductive Bone Matrix, and ALLOCYTE®). This was a result of our increased market penetration, geographic expansion and our continuing strategy to expand our independent distribution network in both new and existing U.S. markets. Earnings Analysis Sanara reported a loss before income taxes of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a loss before income taxes of $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The lower loss in 2023 was primarily due to increased gross profit and changes in fair value of earnout liabilities, partially offset by higher SG&A costs, higher R&D expenses, and higher amortization of our acquired intangible assets. For the year ended December 31, 2023, Sanara had a net loss of $4.4 million, compared to a net loss of $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The lower net loss in 2023 was primarily achieved by additional gross profit realized on higher 2023 revenues. The Company generated Adjusted EBITDA of negative $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of negative $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. * Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the discussion below under the heading “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" and the reconciliations at the end of this release for additional information. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement the Company’s financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we present certain non-GAAP financial measures in this press release and on the related teleconference call, including Adjusted EBITDA. The Company’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, both internally and externally, to assess and communicate the financial performance of the Company. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss excluding interest expense/income, provision/benefit for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock compensation expense, change in fair value of earnout liabilities, and gains/losses from the disposal of property and equipment. The Company’s believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it facilitates comparisons of its core business operations across periods on a consistent basis. Accordingly, the Company adjusts for items such as change in fair value of earnout liabilities when calculating Adjusted EBITDA because the Company believes that it is not related to the Company’s core business operations. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, nor an alternative for, measures conforming to GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. The Company continues to provide all information required by GAAP, but it believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor or other user is limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. The Company does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Material limitations associated with the use of such measures include that they do not reflect all costs included in operating expenses and may not be comparable with similarly named financial measures of other companies. Furthermore, these non-GAAP financial measures are based on subjective determinations of management regarding the nature and classification of events and circumstances. The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with information to evaluate the Company’s operating results in a manner similar to how management evaluates business performance. To compensate for any limitations in such non-GAAP financial measures, management believes that it is useful in understanding and analyzing the results of the business to review both GAAP information and the related non-GAAP financial measures. Whenever the Company uses a non-GAAP financial measure, it provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review and consider these reconciliations. Conference Call Sanara will host a conference call on Tuesday, March 26, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

Over 4,000 QIAstat-Dx instruments placed globally by 2023 for reliable diagnosis of complex syndromes. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Technology Analyst The recent announcement by QIAGEN regarding the QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 2.0 and its software upgrade represents a significant advancement in the field of medical diagnostics. The integration of mobile accessibility for test results through the Remote Results Application is a noteworthy step forward in the syndromic testing market. This functionality is expected to expedite the diagnostic process by allowing healthcare professionals to access, review and confirm results from anywhere, which is particularly beneficial in scenarios where rapid decision-making is critical. The ability to reduce the turnaround time for diagnostic results can lead to faster treatment decisions and potentially improve patient outcomes.Furthermore, the system's enhanced epidemiology dashboards provide valuable data for tracking pathogen spread and prevalence. This can aid public health authorities and hospitals in making informed decisions regarding infection control and resource allocation. The improvements in system responsiveness, automatic updates and extended language support also indicate a user-centric design approach aimed at increasing the system's usability and accessibility globally.From a business perspective, the deployment of over 4,000 instruments worldwide by the end of 2023 suggests a growing market presence for QIAGEN. The company's focus on delivering cost-effective and reliable diagnostics could position it favorably in the competitive landscape, potentially impacting its market share and financial performance positively. Healthcare IT Specialist The QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 2.0's software upgrade to enable mobile access and enhanced remote system management indicates a trend towards digital transformation in healthcare diagnostics. The use of cloud-based technology, such as QIAsphere, for accessing diagnostic data aligns with the broader industry movement towards interoperability and data integration. This is essential for building a more connected healthcare ecosystem where data can be shared securely and efficiently across different platforms and stakeholders.The emphasis on data protection and de-identification of epidemiology data before processing is a critical consideration, given the stringent regulations surrounding patient data privacy, such as GDPR and HIPAA. By adhering to these standards, QIAGEN is not only ensuring compliance but also building trust with its users and patients. Improved security features are essential in mitigating the risk of data breaches, which can have severe financial and reputational consequences for companies.Finally, the system's capability for multiplex real-time PCR, which allows for the detection and differentiation of multiple pathogens, is a sophisticated technological feature that enhances the diagnostic capabilities of laboratories. This could lead to broader adoption of the QIAstat-Dx system, especially in regions where there is a high demand for efficient and comprehensive diagnostic testing. Financial Analyst Investors may view the release of the QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 2.0 and its software enhancements as a positive development for QIAGEN's financial prospects. The ability to streamline diagnostic processes and improve patient care through advanced technology can be a strong selling point that differentiates QIAGEN from competitors. The investment in R&D to bring such innovations to market is indicative of QIAGEN's commitment to maintaining and growing its market share in the molecular diagnostics field.The announcement also indirectly suggests an expansion strategy, given the global placement of over 4,000 QIAstat-Dx instruments. Increased market penetration, especially in regions with emerging healthcare infrastructure, could lead to revenue growth. Additionally, the focus on cost-effectiveness aligns with the financial pressures many healthcare providers face, potentially increasing the attractiveness of QIAGEN's offerings.However, the financial impact of these developments will depend on the adoption rate of the new system and the competitive responses from other players in the diagnostics market. Investors should monitor the uptake of the QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 2.0 and subsequent financial reports to assess the return on investment for QIAGEN's innovation efforts. 03/25/2024 - 04:05 PM QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 2.0 with Software 1.6 release enables mobile access to test results, streamlining diagnostic processes and enhancing patient care // QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 2.0 also offers enhanced epidemiology dashboards and improved remote system management // Growing global presence: Over 4,000 QIAstat-Dx instruments for reliable, fast and cost‑effective diagnosis of complex syndromes placed worldwide by the end of 2023Venlo, the Netherlands, March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- QIAGEN (NYSE: QGEN; Frankfurt Prime Standard: QIA) today announced the release of the QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 2.0, including the Software 1.6 upgrade, a significant enhancement to the widely-used QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 1.0 for reliable, fast and cost-effective diagnosis of complex syndromes. The upgraded diagnostic system, powered by the new QIAstat-Dx Operational Module PRO with a 64‑bit processor and 4GB of RAM, introduces the Remote Results Application, still unique in the syndromic testing space. The new feature, accessible through the QIAsphere cloud and exclusively available with QIAstat‑Dx Analyzer 2.0, allows users to view, comment and confirm diagnostic test results directly from their desktop and mobile devices in any location, facilitating seamless collaboration across the healthcare system.

Alternatively, the QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 2.0 enables in-house visibility of test results over a shared network. “With the QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 2.0 and the Software 1.6 upgrade, QIAGEN is committed to transforming the molecular diagnostics experience by streamlining the connection between labs and healthcare professionals,” said Fernando Beils, Senior Vice President, Head of the Molecular Diagnostics Business Area at QIAGEN. “The integration of the Remote Results Application enables swift and efficient access to crucial test results, ensuring timely and accurate diagnoses for enhanced patient care.” The QIAsphere Insights epidemiology dashboards have also been enhanced, allowing users to view local and global pathogen epidemiology data from all connected QIAstat-Dx instruments. All data is de‑identified before processing and adheres to the highest standards of data protection. Additional upgrades in the QIAstat-Dx Analyzer 2.0 include enhanced instrument responsiveness, automatic software updates and notifications, support for 12 languages, and improved remote system management and security features. The QIAstat-Dx system, designed for laboratory use, employs cost-efficient, single-use cartridges with built‑in sample processing and on-board reagents. Utilizing multiplex real-time PCR, it detects and differentiates between multiple pathogens, with results in about an hour.

Negative None. 03/25/2024 - 06:25 PM TORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / March 25, 2024 / Jaguar Mining Inc. (""Jaguar"" or the ""Company"") (TSX:JAG)(OTCQX:JAGGF) today filed its year-end results, the highlights of which are included in this news release. The full set of audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, accompanying management's discussion and analysis and annual information form can be accessed by visiting the Company's website at https://jaguarmining.com or its profile page on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca . All figures are in US Dollars, unless otherwise expressed.Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 HighlightsGold production for the quarter was 18,482 ounces, gold sold was 18,098 ounces at cash operating costs¹ of $1,089 per ounce of gold sold and all-in sustaining costs¹ of $1,510 per ounce of gold sold. Realized gold prices were $1,982 per ounce.Gold production for the full year was 70,704 ounces, gold sold was 70,525 ounces at cash operating costs¹ of $1,126 per ounce of gold sold and all-in sustaining costs¹ of $1,618 per ounce of gold sold. Realized gold prices were $1,936 per ounce.Revenue for the quarter and full year was $35.9 million and $136.5 million respectively, in line with revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 4% lower compared to full year 2022, driven by fewer ounces produced and sold which was mostly offset by higher realized gold prices.Net income for the quarter and full year was $10.7 million ($0.14 per share) and $15.9 million ($0.21 per share) respectively. Net income for the quarter included credits from the recognition of $5.8 million of a deferred tax asset and impairment reversals of $3.9 million, partially offset by a $1.0 million charge for a provision against a current receivable balance.Operating costs for the quarter and full year were $19.7 million and $79.4 million respectively, compared to operating costs for the quarter and full year of $21.4 million and $84.2 million respectively in 2022.Free cash flow 1 for the quarter and full year was $4.3 million and $11.5 million respectively and was based on operating cash flow plus asset retirement obligation expenditures, less capital. Free cash flow per ounce 1 sold for the quarter and full year was $236 and $163 respectively.As at year end, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $22.0 million.Vern Baker, President and CEO of Jaguar Mining stated: "" We are pleased to report our fourth quarter and full year results for 2023. Strong gold prices and cost optimizations helped offset the many headwinds we faced this past year, including inflation and lower production, and enabled us to end the year with a cash position of $22 million. Production in the second half of the year stabilized and we realized the benefits from adjustments and work that began earlier in the year. Our cost management efforts were evident in the fourth quarter as we reduced our all-in sustaining costs both on a per-tonne and a per-ounce basis despite fewer tonnes being processed. We expect to leverage this better cost structure as we grow our production over the next several years.During the year, we focused on developing our future growth pipeline with a full year of lateral development at our Faina project, where we reached the resource area at the end of 2023. Our focus on the development of Faina will be at the forefront again in 2024 as both infrastructure and ore development will continue throughout the year. The first stoping is expected in the second half of the year and ounce production will increase beyond that point as we ramp up operations. We added further to this growth pipeline with the purchase of IAMGOLD´s Brazilian assets which include the Onças de Pitangui project. This project increased our resource base and advanced our corporate strategy to leverage our extensive nearby infrastructure. We have continued the work started by IAMGOLD on permitting the Onças de Pitangui project, and expect that project development will begin in 2026, followed by first gold that same year and reaching full production in 2028.""2024 OutlookIn 2024, the Company expects production levels at the Turmalina and Pilar mines to be consistent with the fourth quarter of 2023. It is expected that Faina will contribute to production in the second half of the year, resulting in an increase in overall production from 2023 levels. All-in sustaining costs¹ are expected to improve throughout 2024, with higher production in the second half pushing unit costs per ounce down.Vern Baker, President and CEO of Jaguar Mining added: "" We have a great opportunity in front of us as Faina ramps up to full production over the next few years. Our opening up of the Pilar BA-Torre structure has invigorated the Pilar mine´s performance and will contribute to its production in 2024 and ramp up production in 2025 and beyond. With permitting processes moving forward at Onças de Pitangui and other small resources, we expect to build on our base and grow our mine production over the next few years to more fully utilize our existing infrastructure.""1This is a non-GAAP financial performance measure with no standard definition under IFRS.

Readers are cautioned to review the below stated footnotes where the Company expands on its use of non-IFRS measures.Cash operating costs and cash operating cost per ounce are non-IFRS measures. In the gold mining industry, cash operating costs and cash operating costs per ounce are common performance measures but do not have any standardized meaning. Cash operating costs are derived from amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) and include mine-site operating costs such as mining, processing and administration, as well as royalty expenses, but exclude depreciation, depletion, share-based payment expenses, and reclamation costs. Cash operating costs per ounce are based on ounces produced and are calculated by dividing cash operating costs by commercial gold ounces produced; US$ cash operating costs per ounce produced are derived from the cash operating costs per ounce produced translated using the average Brazilian Central Bank R$/US$ exchange rate. The Company discloses cash operating costs and cash operating costs per ounce, as it believes those measures provide valuable assistance to investors and analysts in evaluating the Company's operational performance and ability to generate cash flow. The most directly comparable measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is total production costs. A reconciliation of cash operating costs per ounce to total production costs for the most recent reporting period, the quarter ended December 31, 2023, is set out in the Company's fourth quarter 2023 Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca .All-in sustaining cost is a non-IFRS measure. This measure is intended to assist readers in evaluating the total costs of producing gold from current operations. While there is no standardized meaning across the industry for this measure, except for non-cash items the Company's definition conforms to the all-in sustaining cost definition as set out by the World Gold Council in its guidance note dated June 27, 2013. The Company defines all-in sustaining cost as the sum of production costs, sustaining capital (capital required to maintain current operations at existing levels), corporate general and administrative expenses, and in-mine exploration expenses. All-in sustaining cost excludes growth capital, reclamation cost accretion related to current operations, interest and other financing costs, and taxes. A reconciliation of all-in sustaining cost to total production costs for the most recent reporting period, the quarter ended December 31, 2023, is set out in the Company's fourth quarter 2023 MD&A filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca .SOURCE: Jaguar Mining Inc.View the original press release on accesswire.com What was Jaguar Mining Inc.'s gold production for the full year 2023?

The company signed an OEM agreement with Volvo Bus in Mexico and has seen significant international contract wins. Financially, there was a 128% year-over-year revenue growth in 2023, with a gross profit of NIS 0.752 million. However, there was a net loss of NIS 33.8 million in 2023 due to higher expenses from increased business activities. Positive SaverOne achieved strong revenue growth in 2023, reaching NIS 2.7 million. The company signed a strategic OEM agreement with Volvo Bus in Mexico. SaverOne experienced a 128% year-over-year growth in revenue in 2023. The gross profit for 2023 was NIS 0.752 million, showcasing financial improvement. Successful international contract wins and expansion of business activities were highlighted in the report. Negative The net loss in 2023 was NIS 33.8 million, indicating higher expenses impacting profitability. Cash and cash equivalents decreased from NIS 19.2 million in 2022 to NIS 17.1 million in 2023. Although revenue grew, the net loss increased, posing financial challenges for the company. Financial Analyst The reported revenue growth of approximately 128% for SaverOne, a company specializing in ADAS technologies, is a strong indicator of the company's growing market presence. The expansion into international markets and securing new contracts, such as the OEM agreement with Volvo Bus Corporation in Mexico, is a positive signal for potential investors. However, the increased net loss of NIS 33.8 million in 2023, compared to NIS 25.0 million in 2022, reflects higher expenses associated with these growth efforts. The cash position at the end of the year, NIS 17.1 million, while lower than the previous year, still provides some runway for continued operations and investment in growth.Investors should consider the scalability of SaverOne's business model and the recurring revenue potential from the growing installed base of systems. The strategic importance of patents, such as the newly granted US patent, should not be overlooked as they can provide competitive advantages and barriers to entry for competitors. Nonetheless, the current financials suggest that the company is in an investment phase and profitability is not yet realized, which is not uncommon for growth-stage tech companies. The long-term success will depend on the company's ability to control costs and improve margins while continuing to scale. Market Research Analyst The ADAS market is experiencing significant growth, driven by increasing awareness of road safety and regulatory mandates for vehicle safety systems. SaverOne's land-and-expand strategy, which involves broadening initial penetrations locally to full fleets and securing new international contracts, aligns well with this market trend. The company's focus on specific verticals, such as the private bus fleet industry and strategic partnerships, like the distribution agreement with GVZ Company, are likely to enhance its market penetration.It is essential to note that the ADAS industry is highly competitive, with larger players potentially overshadowing smaller companies like SaverOne. The company's ability to secure deals with notable clients, such as Cemex and Volvo, provides validation of its technology and opens doors for further international expansion. The strategic pilots in North America and Europe are important steps in proving the technology's efficacy and reliability in diverse markets. The growth potential in the sector is substantial, but SaverOne's ability to convert pilots into long-term contracts will be a critical factor in their sustained success and impact on the stock market. Automotive Industry Analyst SaverOne's progress in the ADAS sector is notable, particularly its OEM agreement with Volvo Bus Corporation and the expansion of its solutions into Cemex's fleet in Spain. These developments indicate the company's ability to meet the stringent requirements of OEMs and large-scale fleet operators. The ADAS sector is becoming increasingly integral to modern transportation systems and SaverOne's focus on safety and driver assistance positions it well within this niche.The installation of systems in fleets, such as those of Strauss Group and Egged Tours, signifies trust in SaverOne's technology and the value proposition it offers to corporate clients. The recent patent grant in the US adds intellectual property value and could be a significant asset in negotiating future deals or defending the company's market position. However, the automotive industry is subject to rapid technological changes and regulatory shifts. SaverOne's continued investment in R&D and its ability to adapt to these changes will be important for its long-term viability and attractiveness to investors. 03/25/2024 - 05:18 PM Strong growth continued with 2023 revenue at NIS 2.7 millionPETAH TIKVAH, Israel, March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SaverOne 2014 Ltd.

Under the OEM agreement, SaverOne's Safety Solution will be installed in new Volvo buses that are manufactured for the Mexican market. Volvo Bus customers in Mexico will be offered the SaverOne Safety Solution pre-installed, following integration into Volvo’s assembly line. In addition, the agreement also allows for a retrofit of existing buses covered under Volvo’s maintenance agreement (representing approximately 3,000 buses in the market), which will install SaverOne’s Safety Solution as an aftermarket installation. Financial Summary for 2023 Revenues increased by 128% to NIS 2.720 million (~$0.75 million) in 2023 compared to NIS 1.193 million (~$0.329 million) for 2022. This increase was mainly the result of increased sales of the SaverOne System in Israel with new and existing customers as well as new sales with customers in international regions. Of the revenues in 2023, 93% of revenues were from Israel while 7% of revenues were from Europe. In 2022, 100% of revenues were from Israel. Gross profit increased by 107% to NIS 0.752 million (~$0.207 million), representing gross margin of 27.6% in 2023 compared to NIS 364 thousand (~$0.1 million), representing gross margin of 30.5%, in 2022. Research and development expenses, net were NIS 22.9 million (~$6.3 million) in 2023 compared to NIS 21.5 million (~$5.9 million) in 2022. Selling and marketing expenses were NIS 3.8 million (~$1.0 million) in 2023 compared to NIS 1.6 million (~$0.439 million) in 2022. The increase is attributable mainly to higher payroll and investor relations expenses, as part of the Company’s efforts to increase sales and marketing efforts. General and administrative expenses were NIS 8.3 million (~$2.3 million) in 2023, compared to NIS 6.5 million (~$1.8 million) in 2022. The increase in these expenses was mainly due to additional costs associated with being a US listed public company. Operating loss was NIS 34.2 million (~$9.4 million) in 2023 compared to NIS 29.2 million (~$8.1 million) in 2022, primarily due to increased operating expenses as detailed above. Financing income, net, was NIS 0.388 million (~$0.107 million) for 2023 compared to financing income, net, of NIS 4.2 million (~$1.2 million) in 2022. The decrease is due primarily due to fluctuations in exchange rates and other effects impacting the value of financial assets and liabilities that the Company holds less interest paid. Net loss in 2023 was NIS 33.8 million (~$9.3 million), compared to NIS 26.5 million (~$6.9 million) for 2022. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits as of December 31, 2023, amounted to NIS 17.1 million (~$4.7 million), compared with NIS 19.2 million (~$5.3 million) as of December 31, 2022.

About the SaverOne System SaverOne’s system is installed in vehicles to provide a solution to the problem of driver distraction, as a result of drivers using distracting applications on the mobile phone while driving, in a way that endangers their safety and the safety of their passengers. This phenomenon is considered one of the main causes of road accidents in the world. According to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the annual cost of road accidents just in the United States, stands at about $870 billion each year, excluding the costs of serious injury or death, with a quarter of those accidents estimated to be related to the use of the mobile phones while driving. SaverOne's technology specifically recognizes the driver area in the vehicle and prevents the driver from accessing distracting applications such as messaging, while allowing others (e.g. navigation, calls), without user intervention or consent, creating a safer driving environment. SaverOne’s primary target markets include commercial and private vehicle fleets, including public transportation and buses, that are interested in reducing potential damages and significant cost, vehicle manufacturers that are interested in integrating safety solutions to their vehicles, and insurance and leasing companies. SaverOne initially addresses car fleets with focus on the Israeli, European and US markets, as well as other markets around the world. SaverOne believes that ultimately increased focus on monitoring and prevention of cellular distraction systems in vehicles, in particular driven by upcoming expected EU regulation, will likely have a dramatic positive impact on the demand for its systems in the future. The Company’s strategy is to provide its technology for installation to customers in the aftermarket as well as address OEM vehicle manufacturers, to install the Company's protection technologies during the vehicle manufacturing process. About SaverOne SaverOne is a technology company engaged in the design, development and commercialization of OEM and aftermarket solutions and technologies, to lower the risk of, and prevent, vehicle accidents. SaverOne’s initial line of products is a suite of solutions that saves lives by preventing car accidents resulting from distraction from the use of mobile phones while driving. SaverOne is also developing a sensor system for early location and direction detection under all visibility conditions of vulnerable road users (VRU) through their cellphone footprint.

This does not alter the 2023 financial statements.","Camber Energy Announces Compliance with NYSE Guidelines on Audit Opinion Disclosure Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Camber Energy, Inc. announces receipt of a going concern qualification in its annual report, filed with the SEC. This does not alter the 2023 financial statements. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The disclosure of a going concern qualification by Camber Energy's independent auditors is a significant event for investors and market analysts. This qualification suggests that the auditors have substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern over the next year. It often indicates that a company is facing significant financial distress and may be at risk of defaulting on its obligations or even bankruptcy if circumstances don't improve.Investors should closely monitor the company's cash flow, debt levels and any plans for restructuring or raising additional capital. The market typically reacts negatively to such announcements, as they can affect the company's ability to secure financing and may lead to a decline in stock price due to the heightened risk profile. Long-term implications could include a potential delisting if the company fails to meet financial standards set by the exchange. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the going concern qualification for Camber Energy signals a red flag to investors and stakeholders that the company's financial health is questionable. This may lead to a wider assessment of the energy sector, particularly for companies with similar financial structures or those operating in the same niche. Market sentiment could shift, causing investors to be more cautious, which might result in lower valuations for companies perceived as having similar risk profiles.Moreover, this development could influence peer companies to re-evaluate their financial strategies and reporting practices to avoid similar situations. It's essential to consider the broader market implications, such as the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny on financial disclosures and the importance of transparency in financial reporting within the energy industry. Legal Expert Legally, the announcement fulfills the New York Stock Exchange's requirements for disclosure, which is important for maintaining transparency with the market. However, the presence of a going concern qualification can have legal ramifications. The company may face increased scrutiny from regulators and could be subject to legal challenges, especially if stakeholders feel that the company's financial distress was not adequately communicated.The company must navigate carefully to ensure all subsequent disclosures are accurate and timely to avoid regulatory penalties and maintain investor trust. Furthermore, it's important for the company to review its contractual obligations, as a going concern qualification could trigger clauses related to financial health in agreements with creditors, suppliers and partners. 03/25/2024 - 05:15 PM HOUSTON, TX / ACCESSWIRE / March 25, 2024 / Camber Energy, Inc.

Announces Pricing of $100,000,000 Initial Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags IPO offering acquisition Rhea-AI Summary IB Acquisition Corp. announced its initial public offering of 10,000,000 units at $10.00 per unit. The units will trade on Nasdaq under the symbol 'IBACU'. Each unit includes a share of common stock and a right. I-Bankers Securities, Inc. and IB Capital are the joint book-running managers. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The pricing of IB Acquisition Corp.'s initial public offering (IPO) at $10.00 per unit is a strategic decision that aligns with common practices for blank check companies, also known as special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). The offered units include both a share of common stock and a fractional right to acquire additional stock post-business combination, which is a typical structure meant to incentivize investors to support a future merger or acquisition. The subsequent trading of these units on the Nasdaq Global Market under separate symbols for common stock and rights further facilitates liquidity and provides investors with flexible investment options.The involvement of I-Bankers Securities, Inc. and IB Capital LLC as joint book-runners indicates a solid backing by reputable financial institutions. Moreover, the option granted to underwriters to purchase additional units to cover over-allotments could indicate confidence in the offering's success and may provide a cushion against market volatility. However, investors should be aware that the performance of SPACs can be speculative and dependent on the success of the identified acquisition target. The impact on the stock market is generally limited to the sectors involved in the eventual business combination. Market Research Analyst SPACs have been a popular vehicle for taking companies public in recent years, offering an alternative to the traditional IPO process. The market's reception to SPAC offerings can serve as a barometer for investor sentiment and risk appetite. The pricing at $10.00 per unit is standard, but the market's response in terms of the trading premium post-listing will be indicative of the confidence in the management team's ability to identify and acquire a valuable target company.Investors will likely scrutinize the track record of the management team and the potential sectors for acquisition. The 30-day option for underwriters to purchase additional units is a common measure to stabilize the stock post-IPO. It will be important to monitor the trading activity after the IPO to gauge investor interest and the potential for future business combinations, which could have sector-specific impacts depending on the acquisition target chosen by IB Acquisition Corp. Legal Expert The structure of the offering, which includes common stock and rights, is legally complex and requires careful examination by potential investors. The rights component, entitling holders to additional shares upon a business combination, introduces an element of future valuation that depends on the success of the merger or acquisition. Legal due diligence on the part of investors is important to understand the terms and conditions associated with these securities.The closing of the offering, contingent on regulatory approvals and market conditions, is also a critical legal step. The role of underwriters is not only to facilitate the offering but also to ensure compliance with securities laws and regulations. The 30-day over-allotment option is a standard feature that provides a legal mechanism to manage supply and demand dynamics in the market. Investors should be aware of the legal implications of their investment, especially the conditions under which the rights can be exercised and the potential risks involved. 03/25/2024 - 06:30 PM Boca Raton, Florida, March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IB Acquisition Corp.

The company achieved record nine-month revenue of $19.6 million, showcasing brand growth. The recent IPO bolstered the balance sheet, enabling marketing acceleration and product line expansion. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported net income of $1.2 million for fiscal Q3, alongside a 23% increase in eCommerce sales to $3.8 million, signifies a healthy growth trajectory for Perfect Moment Ltd., particularly in the digital commerce sector. The rise in eCommerce is indicative of effective online strategies and consumer preference shifts. The basic and diluted earnings per share figures, $0.23 and $0.08 respectively, offer a snapshot into the company's profitability and can be of interest to shareholders assessing per-share value.Furthermore, the cash position post-IPO, with no long-term debt, presents a robust financial standing that can support aggressive growth strategies. The gross margin improvement to 39.0% is a positive indicator of cost management and pricing strategy effectiveness. However, investors should monitor whether these margins can be maintained as the company scales up its operations. Market Research Analyst The increase in brand awareness, partly attributed to 'major media wins', suggests that Perfect Moment Ltd. is effectively leveraging media channels to enhance its market presence. This is likely translating into direct financial gains, as seen with the record nine-month revenue of $19.6 million. The reported growth in social media following, especially on platforms like Instagram, Facebook and TikTok, reflects the brand's resonance with a digital-savvy consumer base, which can be pivotal for long-term engagement and customer retention.Additionally, the strategic product line expansion, supported by a strengthened balance sheet, could cater to evolving consumer demands and potentially open up new market segments. However, it is important to assess the sustainability of these growth rates and the ROI on marketing spend, especially as competition in the luxury lifestyle brand space remains intense. E-commerce Specialist The 23% surge in eCommerce sales underscores the increasing importance of a strong online retail presence for fashion and lifestyle brands. Perfect Moment Ltd.'s performance in this area suggests that they are capitalizing on the trend of consumers shopping more online, especially for luxury goods. The company's ability to grow its eCommerce revenue consistently could indicate a competitive edge in digital marketing, website user experience and online customer service.It is also worth noting the 28% increase in eCommerce sales contributing to the nine-month revenue, which highlights the strategic importance of the digital channel in driving sales. The brand's focus on combining fashion with technical performance aligns with a growing consumer trend towards functional yet stylish clothing, which could continue to drive online sales. However, as the digital landscape evolves, ongoing investment in technology and user experience will be essential to maintain this growth momentum. 03/25/2024 - 06:27 PM Fiscal Q3 net income of $1.2 million, or $0.23 per basic share and $0.08 per diluted share, driven by eCommerce sales up 23% to record $3.8 million.

The company’s pro forma cash position following the IPO was $9.8 million, with proforma working capital of $11.3 million and no long-term debt. Management Commentary “Our fiscal third quarter represented a special transitional period for Perfect Moment, as we prepared for our NYSE American IPO, onboarded new talent and senior team leaders, and increased our focus on eCommerce sales,” commented Perfect Moment CEO, Mark Buckley. “Our results for the quarter reflect this transitional period, particularly with the strong growth in eCommerce. Improved production timelines resulted in substantial amount of wholesale shipments typically occurring in the third quarter being accelerated into the second. While it made for a strong second quarter, as a result third quarter revenues were lower compared to the year ago. “While our nine months revenues were strong, reaching a record for the period, the year-over-year growth was marginal since it compares to an unusual period where we experienced a strong elevation in sales due to the ‘covid rebound in FY2024.’ “To be sure, our sales and brand awareness has been strengthening over the long term, with strong growth over the last three reported fiscal years. Black Friday last November was our biggest yet, generating $1.8 million in sales, up 52% versus the prior year, while achieving higher margins due to strategic limited discounting. This momentum continued into our current fourth quarter, and we anticipate marking another period of record revenues for the fiscal quarter and year. “Looking to the new fiscal year that begins in April, we are broadening our lifestyle offerings with the launch of a summer product line that we did not have last year. We are also adding a new direct-to-consumer ‘capsule’ collection for the autumn season. With these new lines, combined with our increasing focus on lifestyle offerings, eCommerce and other planned direct-to-consumer and retail initiatives, we look to lessen the predominate effect of our sales for the winter season and see smoother quarterly results over the long term. “Also underpinning our positive outlook for the new year is our much stronger financial resources, including strong cash position and a debt-free balance sheet— all thanks to the generous participation of our valued new shareholders in our IPO. “We are now fully focused on executing our product strategies. We've just shot our new autumn/winter 2024 collection in Switzerland as we develop our 2025 collection in parallel. These new collections are stunning, so we can't wait for our customers to see them. “We are also exploring a channel expansion into retail, so more customers can experience our products in real life. We anticipate this will help us gain greater market share, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. This necessitates building our teams in the U.S. and opening a U.S. fulfillment center, which we also expect to improve our customer experience and margins. “We have developed a rich marketing eco-system across our entire marketing funnel. We have continued to experience strong growth in social media followers, and especially in the number of celebrities, influencers, models, publications, and fashion industry notables who have organically posted about our brand. We believe we have attracted such a loyal following because of our unique style and how we uniquely combine luxury with technical performance. “We plan to further leverage our strengthening social media presence and relationships with influencers, and further advance our partnership strategies to drive growth in sales and market share. We address an expanding market for luxury outerwear that is projected to grow at a healthy 6.5% CAGR to reach $23.2 billion by 2028.1 “Given these strong industry tailwinds, along with our growing brand awareness, competitive positioning and growth initiatives, we are well positioned to continue to deliver exceptional value to our customers, partners and shareholders in 2025 and beyond.” Fiscal Q3 Financial Summary Total revenue decreased 21% to $12.7 million, compared to $16.1 million in the same year ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the occurrence of some nontraditional seasonality that affected revenue recognition for the quarter; a substantial amount of wholesale revenue that historically was recorded in the third quarter was instead accelerated into the second quarter due to certain earlier-than-planned customer shipments. Wholesale revenue totaled $9.0 million in the quarter, down 32% compared to $13.1 million in the same year-ago quarter. In addition to the timing of the aforesaid revenue recognition, the company’s wholesale accounts also had significantly higher purchases in fiscal year 2022 due to the post Covid rebound. eCommerce revenue increased 23% to $3.8 million compared to $3.0 million. The increase was attributed to greater brand awareness and a stronger focus on eCommerce. Gross profit decreased 22% to $4.9 million from $6.2 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease is primarily attributed to the early shipment of wholesale orders. Gross margin was 38.2% compared to the 38.4% in the prior year. The change in gross margin remained virtually flat in light of a decrease in higher margin wholesale revenue that is attributed to a strategic shift in eCommerce sales and where the company lowered the number of products discounted while maintaining full prices on core products that increased margins. Total operating expenses increased 7% to $4.1 million from $3.9 million in the year-ago. The increase was primarily due to increased SG&A expenses as well as increased marketing and advertising expenses to support growth, drive brand awareness, and prepare Perfect Moment for becoming a public company. Net income totaled $1.2 million, or $0.23 per basic share and $0.08 per diluted share, compared to $3.3 million, or $0.68 per basic share or $0.24 per diluted share, in the same year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.7 million, compared to $4.1 million in the same year-ago quarter, with the decline attributed to the occurrence of some nontraditional seasonality that affected revenue recognition for the quarter. A substantial amount of wholesale revenue that historically was recorded in the third quarter was instead accelerated into the second quarter. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $3.5 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $4.7 million at March 31, 2023. Pro forma cash position including the company’s IPO on February 8, 2023 totaled $9.8 million with no long-term debt. Fiscal First Nine Months 2023 Financial Summary Total revenue increased 1% to a record $19.6 million compared to $19.4 million in the same year-ago period. eCommerce revenue increased 28% to $5.8 million as compared to $4.5 million in the same year-ago period. The increase is attributed to enhanced brand awareness and the company’s increased focus on this direct-to-consumer market channel. eCommerce revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased six percentage points to 29% as compared to 23% in the same year-ago quarter. Wholesale revenue decreased 7% to $13.8 million as compared to $14.9 million in the same year-ago period. The decrease is attributed to significantly higher purchases in fiscal year 2022 due to the post Covid rebound. Gross profit increased 8% to $7.6 million compared to $7.1 million in the same year-ago period. Gross margin increased to 39.0% compared to 36.6% in the same year-ago period. The increases in both gross profit and gross margin are primarily driven by less discounting and fewer discount windows, plus the addition of Global-E as a logistics partner. Total operating expenses decreased 24% to $9.9 million from $13.1 million in the year-ago period. The decrease was primarily due to decreased SG&A, and marketing and advertising expenses. Net loss totaled $3.0 million or $(0.58) per basic share, compared to net loss $7.8 million or $(1.64) per basic share in the same year-ago period. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $1.2 million, compared to a loss of $1.0 million in the same year-ago period.

Perfect Moment creates apparel and products that feature a unique combination of fashion, form, function and fun for women, men and children.

However, adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, income from operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. The company defines adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), plus interest expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, financing costs and changes in fair value of derivative liability. Management considers the company’s core operating performance to be that which its managers can affect in any particular period through their management of the resources that affect the company’s underlying revenue and profit generating operations that period. Non-GAAP adjustments to the company’s results prepared in accordance with GAAP are itemized below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons the company considers them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. For the Three Months Ended For the Nine months ended December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Net income / (loss), as reported $ 1,204 $ 3,267 $ (2,980 ) $ (7,838 ) Adjustments: Interest expense 403 489 1,169 1,411 Stock compensation expense 4 (191 ) 18 3,890 Amortization of pre-paid marketing - 371 185 1,113 Depreciation and amortization 138 138 437 408 Income tax benefit - - - - Total EBITDA adjustments 545 807 1,809 6,822 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,749 $ 4,074 $ (1,171 ) $ (1,016 ) The company presents adjusted EBITDA because it believes it assists investors and analysts in comparing the company’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. In addition, the company uses Adjusted EBITDA in developing its internal budgets, forecasts, and strategic plan; in analyzing the effectiveness of the company’s business strategies in evaluating potential acquisitions; and in making compensation decisions and in communications with its board of directors concerning the company’s financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, which includes, among others, the following: Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the company’s cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the company’s working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect future interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on the company’s debts; and Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and the adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.

Vista Outdoor's Board of Directors is evaluating the new proposal with its financial and legal advisors. No action is required from Vista Outdoor stockholders at this time. Negative None. Financial Analyst The revised unsolicited indication of interest from MNC to acquire Vista Outdoor at $37.50 per share represents a significant event for shareholders and potential investors. The increase from the initial $35.00 per share offer indicates a firm commitment from MNC to pursue the acquisition. This proposal must be evaluated against the backdrop of the existing CSG Merger Agreement to understand the financial implications. The stock market typically responds to such news with increased volatility in the concerned company's stock price, as the market weighs the likelihood of the acquisition and its potential premium over the current trading price.Investors should monitor the response of Vista Outdoor's Board to the revised offer, as it will impact the company's strategic direction and shareholder value. The Board's initial rejection suggests that the offer may not meet their valuation expectations or strategic fit. However, the revised bid may prompt a reevaluation or even a bidding war, potentially leading to a higher offer. The due diligence process and the Board's fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of shareholders will be critical in determining the outcome. Mergers & Acquisitions Expert The dynamics of the proposed all-cash transaction for Vista Outdoor by MNC are complex, given the concurrent CSG Merger Agreement. The Board's decision to reject the initial MNC Indication, citing financial unfavorability and doubts about the deal's completion, is a strategic move. It signals to MNC and other potential acquirers that Vista Outdoor values its assets highly and is not inclined to accept undervalued offers.Furthermore, the Board's stance on the Revised MNC Indication will be influenced by the terms of the existing merger agreement with CSG. Any deviation from the agreed terms might result in legal and financial repercussions. The Board's careful review process, including consultation with financial and legal advisors, indicates a thorough risk assessment approach, which is essential in M&A transactions. The outcome of this situation will offer insights into the M&A landscape, particularly in how companies navigate competing acquisition offers while bound by existing agreements. Legal Expert In the context of the Revised MNC Indication, the legal implications are significant. The Board's obligation to act in accordance with its fiduciary duties while under an existing merger agreement presents a legal challenge. They must balance the potential benefits of the new proposal against the legal commitments and potential penalties involved in the CSG agreement. The legal advisors' role is to ensure that the Board's actions are compliant with corporate law and the terms of the existing merger agreement.The involvement of separate legal advisers for the independent directors of Vista Outdoor suggests a meticulous approach to governance, ensuring that the directors' decisions are made independently and with a clear understanding of the legal ramifications. This reflects the increasing complexity of corporate transactions and the need for specialized legal counsel to navigate these waters. The unfolding of these events will be closely watched by the legal community for its implications on merger agreements and fiduciary duties. 03/25/2024 - 05:06 PM ANOKA, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Vista Outdoor Inc. (NYSE: VSTO) today confirmed that it has received a revised unsolicited indication of interest from MNC Capital (“MNC”) pursuant to which MNC expresses its interest in acquiring Vista Outdoor in an all-cash transaction for $37.50 per share (the “Revised MNC Indication”). On March 4, 2024, the Vista Outdoor Board of Directors (the “Vista Outdoor Board”) rejected an unsolicited indication of interest received on February 19, 2024 from MNC pursuant to which MNC expressed interest in acquiring Vista Outdoor in an all-cash transaction for $35.00 per Vista Outdoor share (the “Initial MNC Indication”). The Vista Outdoor Board carefully reviewed and considered the Initial MNC Indication in consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors. After a thorough evaluation of the merits and risks of the MNC Indication, the Board determined that the MNC Indication would not be more favorable to Vista stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by the CSG Merger Agreement, was not reasonably capable of being completed and did not constitute a basis for engagement with MNC. The Board therefore rejected the MNC Indication. Vista Outdoor’s Board has not made any determination with respect to the Revised MNC Indication within the framework contemplated by the existing merger agreement with Czechoslovak Group a.s. (“CSG”), which remains in effect, nor has it changed its recommendation in support of the acquisition of its Sporting Products business by CSG. Vista Outdoor’s Board of Directors is carefully reviewing the Revised MNC Indication, in accordance with its fiduciary duties and its obligations under the existing merger agreement with CSG, in consultation with its financial and legal advisors. Vista Outdoor’s Board of Directors remains committed to acting in the best interests of Vista Outdoor stockholders. Vista Outdoor stockholders do not need to take any action at this time.

The fourth-quarter and full-year financial results met revised outlook but missed initial expectations. Strategic changes are expected to drive future growth. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst When evaluating BuzzFeed's recent financial results, it's important to consider the implications for investors and the broader market. The company's performance was consistent with its revised forecast, which may have already been priced into the stock. However, the shortfall relative to its initial expectations could indicate underlying challenges in its business model or competitive landscape.Given the focus on high-margin revenue streams, this suggests a strategic pivot towards more profitable endeavors. This could potentially improve profit margins and shareholder value in the long term. Investors should monitor the effectiveness of these changes and whether they lead to sustainable growth.Strengthening the balance sheet in preparation for a 2024 sale is a significant move. This could be a positive signal for investors, as it may lead to a higher sale price and, consequently, a return of capital. However, it's important to assess the quality of the assets being sold and the terms of the sale once they become available. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, BuzzFeed's shift towards owned and operated properties is noteworthy. In the digital media space, owning content and distribution channels can lead to improved control over monetization strategies and advertising revenue. This could be a strategic move to differentiate from competitors that rely heavily on third-party platforms.However, the transition to high-margin businesses often requires upfront investments and may not yield immediate financial benefits. It's essential to track how this strategy affects user engagement and advertising performance. The long-term success of this pivot will depend on BuzzFeed's ability to attract a loyal audience and premium advertisers. Media Industry Analyst BuzzFeed's decision to renew its focus on specific revenue streams aligns with broader industry trends where media companies are looking to diversify away from volatile advertising models. This could be a response to the increasing challenges in the digital advertising market, such as privacy regulations and changes in ad tracking technologies.Investors should be aware of the risks associated with BuzzFeed's strategic changes. While these moves could lead to higher margins, they also require successful execution and market acceptance. The media landscape is highly competitive and BuzzFeed's ability to maintain its brand relevance while transitioning its business model will be critical. 03/25/2024 - 04:32 PM Company Renews Focus on High-Margin Revenue Streams and Owned & Operated Properties and Strengthens Balance Sheet for 2024 Sale of Complex Marks an Important Milestone for BuzzFeed, Inc. NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BuzzFeed, Inc.’s (“BuzzFeed” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: BZFD) fourth quarter and full year (ended December 31, 2023) financial results were in line with its revised outlook shared in February, but fell short of its initial expectations. Looking ahead, following key strategic organizational changes, BuzzFeed is optimistic about 2024 with a commitment to high-margin revenue streams and a renewed focus on its owned and operated websites and apps. “Three months into 2024, it’s clear BuzzFeed and digital media are at an inflection point,” said Jonah Peretti, BuzzFeed Founder & CEO. “We’ve restructured our business to focus on our scalable, high-margin, and tech-led revenue streams. We are leveraging AI tools to optimize our owned and operated platforms, accelerate innovation, and make our sites and apps more engaging, more personalized and more rewarding for all. Despite challenges over the past year, I’m optimistic about BuzzFeed's trajectory in 2024. I believe we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us to build the defining media company for the AI era.” 2023 Full Year Financial and Operational Highlights for Continuing Operations (excluding Complex)1 BuzzFeed delivered Full Year 2023 revenues of $252.7 million, declining 26% compared to 2022 Advertising revenue declined 31% year-over-year to $115.6 million Content revenue declined 31% year-over-year to $83.6 million Commerce and other revenues were relatively flat year-over-year at $53.4 million Net loss from continuing operations was $60.3 million, compared to a net loss of $140.5 million in 2022 Adjusted EBITDA2 loss was $4.7 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $0.3 million in 2022 In 2023, audience Time Spent3 with our content was 306 million hours.

As such, the historical financial results of Complex Networks have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. Amounts presented throughout this press release are on a continuing operations basis. 2Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a description of how it is calculated and the tables at the back of this earnings release for a reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results. 3Excludes Complex Networks and Facebook; see definition of “Time Spent” below.

Refer to “Forward-Looking Statements” below for information on factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a description of how Adjusted EBITDA is calculated. While Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, we have not provided guidance for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure — net income (loss) from continuing operations — due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary to forecast such a measure. Accordingly, a reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance for Adjusted EBITDA to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available. ________________________________ 4Source: Comscore Media Trend, A18+, December 2023; Comps include Condé Nast Digital, Vox Media, People, Bustle Digital Group, Dot Dash Meredith Quarterly Conference Call BuzzFeed’s management team will hold a conference call to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results today, March 25, at 5PM ET.

Definitions BuzzFeed reports revenues across three primary business lines: Advertising, Content and Commerce and other. The definition of “Time Spent” is also set forth below. Advertising revenues are primarily generated from advertisers for ads distributed against our editorial and news content, including display, pre-roll and mid-roll video products sold directly to brands and also programmatically. We distribute these ad products across our owned and operated sites as well as third-party platforms, primarily YouTube and Apple News. Content revenues are primarily generated from clients for custom assets, including both long-form and short-form content, from branded quizzes to Instagram takeovers to sponsored content and content licensing. Revenues for film and TV projects are also included here. Commerce and other revenues consist primarily of affiliate commissions earned on transactions initiated from our editorial shopping content. Revenues from our product licensing businesses are also included here. Time Spent captures the time audiences spend engaging with our content across our owned and operated sites, as well as YouTube and Apple News, as measured by Comscore. This metric excludes time spent with our content on platforms for which we have minimal advertising capabilities that contribute to our Advertising revenues, including Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter. There are inherent challenges in measuring the total actual number of hours spent with our content across all platforms; however, we consider the data reported by Comscore to represent industry-standard estimates of the time actually spent on our largest distribution platforms with our most significant monetization opportunities. Effective January 1, 2023, we exclude time spent on Facebook from our measure of Time Spent as our monetization strategy is increasingly focused on advertising on our owned and operated properties, and Facebook now contributes an immaterial amount of advertising revenue. Time Spent on Facebook, as reported by Facebook, was approximately 58 and 184 million hours for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Additionally, Time Spent presented above excludes time spent on Complex Networks, as Complex Networks is presented as a discontinued operation within our consolidated financial statements. Time Spent on Complex Networks, as reported by Comscore, was approximately 76 million and 126 million hours for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Time Spent on Complex Networks, as reported by Comscore, previously included Time Spent on First We Feast, as First We Feast was historically under the Complex Networks’ measurement portfolio of Comscore. However, the historical Time Spent on First We Feast cannot be reasonably bifurcated from Time Spent on Complex Networks. Accordingly, for comparability of Time Spent, we have excluded Time Spent on First We Feast from our measure of Time Spent for all periods presented above and for future reporting of Time Spent. About BuzzFeed, Inc. BuzzFeed, Inc. is home to the best of the Internet.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures and represent key metrics used by management and our board of directors to measure the operational strength and performance of our business, to establish budgets, and to develop operational goals for managing our business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) from continuing operations, excluding the impact of net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests, income tax provision (benefit), interest expense, net, other (income) expense, net, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, change in fair value of derivative liability, restructuring costs, impairment expense, transaction-related costs, certain litigation costs, public company readiness costs, and other non-cash and non-recurring items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by revenue for the same period. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are relevant and useful information for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by our management. There are limitations to the use of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin and our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be considered a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP are included at the end of this press release following the accompanying financial data.

(AMPE) has decided to voluntarily delist its common stock from NYSE American and deregister its stock to terminate reporting obligations under the Exchange Act. The company notified NYSE American of this decision and plans to file a Form 25 with the SEC for delisting and deregistration. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision by Ampio Pharmaceuticals to delist from the NYSE American and deregister its common stock is a significant strategic move. This action typically suggests a desire to reduce regulatory burdens and costs associated with public reporting. It may also indicate that the company is seeking greater flexibility to operate without the scrutiny of public investors and analysts. For current shareholders, this could mean less liquidity and transparency, as the stock will no longer trade on a major exchange. However, the cost savings from reduced compliance requirements could potentially be redirected towards product development or operational efficiencies.From a financial perspective, the impact on the stock's valuation could be mixed. On one hand, reduced visibility in the market can lead to a decrease in investor interest and, consequently, a lower stock price. On the other hand, if the company is able to leverage the cost savings and increased operational flexibility effectively, it could lead to improved financial performance over the long term. Stakeholders should monitor the company's future financial disclosures, if any and strategic moves closely to understand the implications of this decision. Market Research Analyst Delisting is a relatively rare event and often reflects underlying challenges or strategic shifts within a company. In the pharmaceutical industry, where investor sentiment can be heavily influenced by regulatory news and clinical trial results, the decision to delist might raise concerns about Ampio Pharmaceuticals' current performance and future prospects. Market participants might speculate that the company is facing challenges that could be mitigated by operating outside the public eye.Additionally, the move to delist can affect the broader perception of the pharmaceutical sector, particularly among smaller cap companies. Investors might become more cautious about investing in similar companies due to perceived increased risks. This could result in a reevaluation of risk premiums for the sector. For potential institutional investors, the delisting could signal a red flag, prompting a more thorough due diligence process before any investment decision. Legal Expert The legal implications of Ampio Pharmaceuticals' decision to delist and deregister its common stock are considerable. The company will no longer be bound by the stringent reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which could lead to a reduction in administrative overhead. However, this also means that the company will be subject to less regulatory oversight, which might concern investors about the company's governance and transparency.It is also important to understand that the deregistration process involves legal complexities that must be handled meticulously to comply with SEC regulations. The company's intention to file a Form 25 with the SEC is the first step in this process. Shareholders and potential investors should be aware that once the company deregisters, they will likely have access to significantly less information about the company's financial health and operations, which could impact their ability to make informed investment decisions. 03/25/2024 - 05:00 PM ENGLEWOOD, Colo., March 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE American: AMPE) (the ""Company"" or ""Ampio"") today announced that its Board of Directors determined to voluntarily delist its common stock from the NYSE American and deregister its common stock in order to terminate and suspend its reporting obligations under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""). The Company today notified the NYSE American of its intention to voluntarily delist its shares of common stock from the NYSE American. The Company intends to file a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") to effect the delisting and deregistration of its common stock on or about April 4, 2024 and the delisting is expected to become effective on or about April 14, 2024. Following the delisting of the Company's common stock from the NYSE American, the Company intends to file a Form 15 with the SEC on or about April 15, 2024 to suspend its reporting obligations under the Act. As a result of the filing of the Form 15, the Company's obligation to file certain Exchange Act reports and forms with the SEC, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, will cease. Other SEC filing requirements will terminate upon the effectiveness of the deregistration. The Company expects that the deregistration of its common stock will become effective 90 days after the filing of the Form 15 with the SEC. The documents filed with the SEC will be available on the Company's website below. The Board made the decision to pursue delisting and deregistration of its common stock following its review and careful consideration of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the Company's current and likely future non-compliance with the continued listing requirements of the NYSE American that would inevitably result in delisting of the Company's common stock by the NYSE American and the required personnel resources and the high costs relating to Exchange Act and NYSE American disclosure and reporting requirements and related regulatory burdens, which have resulted and would continue to result in significant operating expense. In light of these factors, the Board has determined that it is in the Company's best interests that the Company take steps designed to ensure sufficient cash to adequately fund an orderly wind down of the Company's operations and to maximize the Company's cash position. About Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE American: AMPE) had previously focused on the development of a potential treatment for osteoarthritis as part of its OA-201 program.

It is essential, however, for Nxu to continuously update and audit their security measures to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats. Financial Analyst The release of the NxuOne™ mobile app could have various financial implications for Nxu, Inc. In the short term, the development and marketing costs associated with the app launch may impact the company's financials. However, if the app succeeds in driving user engagement and increasing the utilization of Nxu's charging network, there could be a positive effect on the company's revenue.In the long term, the app could provide Nxu with valuable user data and usage patterns, enabling them to optimize their charging network and introduce targeted services.

Negative TIRX received a notice of non-compliance from Nasdaq for not filing its annual report on time, impacting its compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). This situation may raise concerns among investors about the company's adherence to regulatory requirements and its financial reporting practices. Financial Analyst The notice of non-compliance received by TIAN RUIXIANG Holdings Ltd from Nasdaq is a significant regulatory event that can potentially impact investor confidence and the company's stock performance. The delay in filing the annual report indicates operational or financial issues that require attention. Investors and analysts typically scrutinize such reports for insights into a company's financial health, strategic direction and operational efficiency. The delay could signal underlying problems such as accounting irregularities or challenges in internal controls.While the immediate effect on the stock's listing status is non-existent, the potential long-term implications cannot be ignored. If the company fails to submit a satisfactory plan or regain compliance within the given timeframe, it risks delisting. A delisting could severely reduce the stock's liquidity and attractiveness to institutional investors, potentially leading to a decline in share price and market capitalization. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the failure to meet the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) is a matter of concern as it reflects on the company's governance and compliance framework. The SEC requires timely filings to ensure transparency and protect investors. Non-compliance may attract regulatory scrutiny and erode stakeholder trust. It is essential for the company to address the root cause of the delay and implement corrective measures to ensure future compliance.Moreover, the company's ability to submit a convincing plan to regain compliance is crucial. The plan should not only outline the steps to file the overdue report but also demonstrate measures to prevent future occurrences. This will be a test of the company's commitment to regulatory adherence and could influence investor perception. Market Research Analyst The news of non-compliance may also impact the company's competitive position within the insurance brokerage industry. As trust and reliability are key factors in this sector, potential clients may be deterred, affecting the company's ability to attract and retain business. The market will be observing closely how TIAN RUIXIANG addresses this issue, as it could be indicative of the company's operational resilience and management's ability to navigate regulatory landscapes.Furthermore, the industry benchmark for regulatory compliance is high and any deviation from this norm is usually met with investor caution. The company's response to this challenge will be pivotal in maintaining its industry standing and ensuring that it does not lose ground to competitors who are in good regulatory standing. 03/25/2024 - 04:30 PM BEIJING, March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TIAN RUIXIANG Holdings Ltd (Nasdaq: TIRX) (the ""Company""), a China-based insurance broker conducting business through its variable interest entity in China, today announced that on March 20, 2024, it received a notice of non-compliance from Nasdaq Listing Qualifications which states that, as a result of not having timely filed its annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023 (the ""2023 Form 20-F""), the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires timely filing of periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"").

Positive Solid dividend yield of 4.1% provides attractive returns for investors Orders show year-over-year improvement, indicating strong demand Stonegate Capital Partners' coverage update offers valuable insights for investors Negative Macroeconomic headwinds present short-term challenges for Hooker Furniture Market Research Analyst The recent update on Hooker Furniture Corporation highlights several factors that are pertinent to both the company's performance and investor considerations. The mention of macroeconomic headwinds suggests that the broader economic environment is challenging, which could be due to a variety of factors such as inflation, interest rates, or consumer spending patterns. These conditions typically lead to cautious spending by consumers, especially on durable goods like furniture.However, the strong dividend yield of 4.1% is a significant figure, as it is relatively high compared to the average dividend yield within the industry. This could indicate that Hooker Furniture is prioritizing shareholder returns, which may be attractive to income-focused investors, especially in a volatile market. Yet, a high dividend yield can also imply that the stock price has fallen, raising the yield percentage, which requires further investigation into the company's valuation.The improvement in orders and a strong backlog are positive indicators of demand for Hooker Furniture's products. A strong backlog usually means that the company has a solid base of future revenue, assuming it can efficiently convert these orders into sales. This could be a sign of resilience despite the macroeconomic challenges and may point to effective management and competitive product offerings. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the key takeaways from the coverage update on Hooker Furniture Corporation necessitate a deeper look into the company's financial health. The improved year-over-year orders and strong backlog could indicate that the company is effectively managing its supply chain and inventory, which has been a significant challenge for many companies in the post-pandemic era. Efficient inventory management can lead to better cash flow and reduced storage costs.Investors should also consider the sustainability of the company's dividend yield. A thorough analysis of the payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders, is essential to assess whether the dividends are being funded from earnings or through debt, which could be unsustainable in the long term. Additionally, examining the company's earnings reports and future earnings guidance would provide insights into whether the current dividend yield is likely to be maintained.Regarding the macroeconomic headwinds, investors should examine how Hooker Furniture has historically navigated economic downturns. This could provide an understanding of the company's resilience and the effectiveness of its strategic responses to external pressures. 03/25/2024 - 04:24 PM Dallas, Texas--(Newsfile Corp. - March 25, 2024) - Hooker Furniture Corporation (NASDAQ: HOFT): Stonegate Capital Partners updates their coverage on Hooker Furniture Corporation (NASDAQ: HOFT) To view the full announcement, including downloadable images, bios, and more, click here.

Negative Potential delisting from Nasdaq due to filing delinquency and failure to meet bid price requirements. Financial Analyst The notice of potential delisting received by Bruush Oral Care Inc. from Nasdaq is a significant event with potential repercussions for the company's financial health and investor confidence. Delisting often leads to reduced liquidity and access to capital, as many institutional investors are mandated to invest in listed securities. The stock price, already below the $1 threshold, reflects market concerns about the company's financial stability and compliance with exchange regulations.In assessing the company's situation, it is important to consider the broader implications of failing to file an annual report. This delay raises questions about the company's internal controls and governance practices. Investors should monitor the company's ability to address these issues promptly as they may impact future financial performance and operational efficiency. Legal Expert The legal process initiated by Bruush Oral Care Inc. to appeal the Nasdaq's delisting determination underscores the procedural rights afforded to companies under Nasdaq's Listing Rule 5800 Series. The scheduled hearing offers the company an opportunity to present a plan to regain compliance. However, investors should be aware of the legal uncertainties and the time-consuming nature of such proceedings.It is important for stakeholders to understand that the outcome of the hearing is not guaranteed and the company's securities may still face delisting. This uncertainty can have a chilling effect on the stock as the market digests the potential risks associated with the company's legal and regulatory challenges. Market Research Analyst The oral care industry is competitive, with innovation and regulatory compliance being key factors for success. Bruush Oral Care Inc.'s current predicament may offer competitors an advantage in terms of market share and investor confidence. If Bruush fails to convince the Panel of its plan to regain compliance, the company could face significant barriers to market re-entry.Investors should also consider the impact of consumer perception on Bruush's brand value and sales, as publicized financial and regulatory struggles can affect consumer trust.

Negative None. 03/25/2024 - 04:30 PM THIS NEWS RELEASE IS NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO U.S. NEWSWIRE SERVICES FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATESVANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / March 25, 2024 / South Star Battery Metals Corp. (""South Star"" or the ""Company"") (TSXV:STS)(OTCQB:STSBF), is pleased to announce that it has awarded contracts for the National Instrument 43-101 (""NI43-101"") Preliminary Economic Assessment (""PEA"" or the ""Study"") for the BamaStar Graphite Project (""BamaStar""). The interdisciplinary team of consultants, engineers and scientists is co-led by Dorfner ANZAPLAN GmbH and Lycopodium Limited. The PEA is anticipated to be completed and published in July 2024. With the recent mineral lease and surface rights extensions, South Star has successfully completed all the other requirements for BamaStar's option agreement, and preparing the PEA is the final milestone that will give the Company the right to acquire an undivided 75% legal and beneficial interest in and to the minerals, mining rights and the underlying agreements for the mine.The PEA will incorporate the Company's 2023 drill-program results, providing an update to the maiden Mineral Resource Estimate for the BamaStar project. The Study's techno-economic analysis will present a scenario with concentrates from both BamaStar and Santa Cruz providing feedstocks for the secondary processed, specialty-graphite products. The Study will outline the strategic production/commercial plan for South Star's planned downstream transformation plant for the manufacturing of battery-graphite and other specialty-graphite commercial products, in the southeastern USA.Additionally, senior representatives of the Company have engaged and met with numerous senior economic-development representatives for states in the region, including Alabama and Louisiana. The team has commenced a site-selection process to determine the most advantageous location for siting South Star's planned downstream transformation plant to produce coated spherical purified graphite (""CSPG"") for lithium-ion (""Li-ion"") battery applications, in addition to conductivity-enhancement products suited for numerous battery chemistries, and other unique and innovative products.Richard Pearce, CEO of South Star, commented, ""We are pleased to kickoff the PEA for BamaStar and to advance the project together with our partners. The PEA is expected to take approximately three to four months to complete, and we believe it will present a robust scenario with two scalable mines producing high-quality concentrates and a value-add plant in the middle of one of the most critical EV, defense, and energy storage corridors in the U.S. At a time of increasing geopolitical risks and supply-chain concerns regarding critical metals and the energy transition, it's great to be one of the first movers advancing a phased, vertically integrated graphite supply chain with near-term production and high-quality assets in Tier 1 jurisdictions in the Americas.""In addition, 10 kg of Santa Cruz material is being tested as part of ongoing characterization and optimization of the Santa Cruz graphite concentrates for battery applications for the Company's US downstream transformational technologies technical program. Currently, Santa Cruz graphite concentrate is being analyzed, purified, transformed and upgraded to produce a variety of different products, including CSPG.As part of that ongoing characterization, the as-received Santa Cruz graphite concentrate was recently imaged using scanning electron microscop (""SEM""), as shown in the Figure 1 below. Figure 1: The SEM image on the above left is of South Star's >96% Cg graphite concentrate from the Santa Cruz Graphite Mine in Brazil. The SEM image on the above right is of the EXACT same material as in the image on the left, imaged concurrently, but utilizing a SEM backscattered electron detector. Backscattered electron imaging is used to differentiate between materials of different compositions. Phases heavier than carbon will look bright (meaning, impurities will luminesce), and pure carbon will look matte black, as seen here. The even coloration demonstrates the >96% C purity of the Santa Cruz graphite concentrate.ABOUT DORFNER ANZAPLAN GmbHDorfner is a leading European specialty minerals producer delivering high-quality mineral products to different industries.

Enstar Subsidiary Assigned ‘A’ Financial Strength Rating by S&P Global,2024-03-25T20:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Enstar Group  (NASDAQ: ESGR) receives an 'A' rating with a stable outlook from S&P for its subsidiary Cavello Bay Reinsurance , highlighting Enstar's leadership in the global non-life run-off market and strong claims management capabilities.","Enstar Subsidiary Assigned ‘A’ Financial Strength Rating by S&P Global Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Enstar Group (NASDAQ: ESGR) receives an 'A' rating with a stable outlook from S&P for its subsidiary Cavello Bay Reinsurance , highlighting Enstar's leadership in the global non-life run-off market and strong claims management capabilities. Positive None. Negative None. Insurance Analyst The 'A' Insurer Financial Strength Rating bestowed upon Cavello Bay by S&P Global Ratings is a strong indicator of financial robustness within the insurance industry. This rating is pivotal as it reflects an insurer's ability to meet its policyholders' obligations, which can significantly influence customer trust and business stability. For Enstar Group Limited, this rating not only endorses their capital adequacy but also enhances their credibility in the market. Moreover, a stable outlook suggests a low probability of rating changes in the near term, which can be reassuring for investors and policyholders alike.From a business perspective, the rating may facilitate Enstar's engagement in larger and more complex legacy transactions. It is an acknowledgment of their effective claims management and strategic positioning as a run-off consolidator. This can potentially lead to favorable borrowing terms, reduced collateral requirements for reinsurance contracts and an overall competitive edge in negotiating new deals.However, it's essential to consider the dynamic nature of the reinsurance market, where regulatory changes, catastrophic events, or financial market volatility could impact future ratings. Stakeholders should monitor the company's adherence to risk management practices and capital preservation strategies to maintain this rating. Financial Analyst An 'A' rating from S&P can have a tangible impact on a company's financial strategy and its appeal to investors. For Enstar's subsidiary, Cavello Bay, this rating may translate into a lower cost of capital, as investors typically demand less risk premium from higher-rated entities. The stable outlook is indicative of predictable financial performance, which can be a significant factor in investment decisions.Enstar's acknowledgment by S&P as a leader in the non-life run-off market is a testament to its business model and market position. This could lead to increased investor confidence and potentially an uptick in stock market performance, as the market often reacts positively to such affirmations of a company's financial health and industry standing.However, investors should also weigh this news against the broader economic context and sector-specific challenges. While the rating is an important metric, it is not the sole determinant of a company's stock performance and a diversified evaluation approach should be maintained. Market Research Analyst The Insurer Financial Strength Rating of 'A' with a stable outlook places Enstar's subsidiary, Cavello Bay, in a favorable position within the non-life insurance run-off sector. The rating acts as a differentiator in a competitive landscape, potentially attracting more business and partnerships. It may also influence the perception of Enstar's brand, which can be leveraged in marketing and negotiation platforms.Given the emphasis on Enstar's expectation to continue executing large legacy transactions, the rating could be seen as a precursor to future growth in this niche segment. This growth could be driven by an increased capacity to underwrite larger policies and absorb more significant portfolios from other insurers looking to de-risk or exit certain lines of business.It is important for stakeholders to understand that while the rating is a positive development, the insurance market is subject to rapid changes. Continuous innovation in products and services, along with maintaining the high standards that led to the 'A' rating, will be important for Enstar to capitalize on the opportunities this rating may present. 03/25/2024 - 04:15 PM HAMILTON, Bermuda, March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Enstar Group Limited (NASDAQ: ESGR) announced today that the ratings agency S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”) has assigned an Insurer Financial Strength Rating of ‘A’ with stable outlook to its Bermuda-based, wholly owned subsidiary, Cavello Bay Reinsurance Limited (“Cavello Bay”). Cavello Bay is Enstar’s primary non-life run-off consolidator, and a Class 3B reinsurer. On issuing its rating, S&P highlighted Enstar’s competitive position as a “leader in the global non-life run-off market”, noting that it considers Enstar’s claims management capabilities to be “excellent”, as well as its expectation that Enstar will “continue executing large legacy transactions.” Matthew Kirk, Enstar’s Chief Financial Officer, said: “The S&P Insurer Financial Strength Rating is further confirmation of our strong capital position. The ‘A’ rating for Cavello Bay, our primary Bermuda reinsurer, recognizes the resilience of our business model and will provide additional flexibility to structure legacy transactions in the future.” About Enstar Enstar is a NASDAQ-listed leading global insurance group that offers innovative capital release solutions through its network of group companies in Bermuda, the United States, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Australia, and other international locations. A market leader in completing legacy acquisitions, Enstar has acquired 117 companies and portfolios since its formation in 2001. For further information about Enstar, see www.enstargroup.com.

The company saw a 46% increase in adjusted revenue and other income and a 119% increase in adjusted royalty revenue in 2023. EMX also highlighted major investments by partners, strong cash flows enabling debt repayment, and continued growth through generative business partnerships. Positive EMX Royalty reported a 46% increase in adjusted revenue and other income in 2023. Adjusted royalty revenue for EMX increased by 119% in 2023. Key investments were made by Zijin Mining Group at Timok for the development of upper and lower zones. EMX showcased strong and consistent operating cash flows, leading to the early repayment of $10,000,000 of debt. The company generated $5,462,000 in revenue and other income through generative business partnerships in 2023. EMX entered into 20 new partnership agreements in 2023, with over $39,000,000 in partnership expenditures. The company adopted the use of Gold Equivalent Ounces (GEOs) as a metric to better understand its business performance. EMX provided guidance for 2024, as detailed in the MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial performance of EMX Royalty Corporation indicates a noteworthy uptick in revenue, with a 46% increase in adjusted revenue and other income and a significant 119% increase in adjusted royalty revenue for 2023. This suggests a robust enhancement in the company's royalty streams, primarily driven by its diversified gold royalty portfolio and the strategic increase in the net smelter return royalty for the Caserones property. The adoption of Gold Equivalent Ounces (GEOs) as a non-IFRS financial measure provides a nuanced understanding of the company's earnings, as it reflects the adjusted royalty revenue more accurately by excluding less predictable income streams like Option payments.Moreover, the early repayment of debt highlights a strong liquidity position, underpinned by consistent operating cash flows. This financial prudence could be appealing to investors seeking companies with sound capital management strategies. However, the reported net loss for the year, in contrast to the previous year's net income, may raise concerns about the company's expense management and the sustainability of its growth trajectory. Investors should monitor the company's ability to control costs while sustaining revenue growth. Mining Industry Analyst EMX's operational highlights, such as the resolution of the Timok royalty issues and the continued investments by Zijin Mining Group, demonstrate a strategic focus on developing flagship assets and ensuring the advancement of projects with high potential. The increase in NSR royalty percentage post-year-end further solidifies EMX's revenue base from the Caserones property, which is significant given the property's contribution to the company's revenue stream.The company's generative business model, characterized by the formation of 20 new partnership agreements and over $39 million in partnership expenditures, showcases EMX's commitment to exploration and expansion. This approach not only diversifies the company's portfolio but also leverages partner capital to mitigate direct exploration risks. Stakeholders should consider the long-term prospects of these partnerships and the potential for additional revenue streams as these projects mature. Market Research Analyst EMX Royalty Corporation's strategic advancements and strong revenue growth are indicative of effective management and a positive outlook for the company within the mining sector. The use of GEOs as a performance metric aligns with industry practices, allowing for a more comparable assessment of the company's financial health against peers. The company's focus on gold assets, particularly during a time when gold is often viewed as a safe-haven asset, could position EMX favorably in market conditions characterized by volatility and economic uncertainty.However, it's important for investors to analyze the long-term sustainability of the revenue generated from the partnerships and the impact of fluctuating commodity prices on royalty income. The forward-looking guidance provided by the company will be a key factor for investors to gauge future performance and assess whether the current growth can be maintained or improved upon. 03/25/2024 - 04:15 PM Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - March 25, 2024) - EMX Royalty Corporation (NYSE American: EMX) (TSXV: EMX) (FSE: 6E9) (the ""Company"" or ""EMX"") is pleased to report results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023 (in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted).The 2023 year was a pivotal one for EMX as we amicably resolved the issues with the Timok royalty; increased our (effective) net smelter return (""NSR"") royalty in the Caserones property to 0.7775% and subsequent to year end to 0.8306%; saw strong performance from our gold royalty portfolio anchored by Leeville and Gediktepe; continued to invest capital generating and acquiring royalties around the world while our partners continued to invest significant capital to expand operations at existing mines, advance new mines, and explore for new opportunities. As previously announced, the Company is providing guidance for 2024 (see below). In conjunction with providing guidance, the Company has adopted the use of Gold Equivalent Ounces1 (""GEOs"") as a metric to better understand our business.

Timok royalty revenue for 2023 included 2,483 GEOs1 sold for 2021 and 2022 production.2024 GuidanceAGEOs sales111,000 to 14,000Adjusted royalty revenue1$22,000,000 to $27,500,000Option and other property income$2,000,000 to $3,000,000 A. Assumed commodity prices of $1,939/oz gold and $3.89/lb copper based on CIBC Global Mining Group's Consensus Commodity Price Forecasts published on January 2, 2024.Guidance in 2024 is based on public forecasts, other disclosure by the owners and operators of our assets, historical performance and management's understanding of the underlying producing assets. Additionally, the Company may receive information from the owners and operators of the properties, which the Company is not permitted to disclose to the public pursuant to the underlying agreement or the information has not been prepared in accordance with Canadian disclosure standards, including National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (""NI 43-101"").More specifically, Leeville's guidance is based on historical performance as the Company has no rights to data and must rely on publicly available information delivered by Nevada Gold Mines. Gediktepe's guidance contribution is based partly on 2023 actual results, as well as a confidential 3-year mine plan provided by the operator for the 2024 year. Timok's guidance contribution is based on 2023 actual results only given the limited access to operational data and forward-looking plans. Caserones' guidance is based on 2023 actual results and guidance disclosed by the operator, which has been increased slightly by EMX due to the higher percentage ownership of our effective royalty. Balya and Gold Bar South are based on 2023 historical performance only, given limited access to information. OutlookThe Company is excited about the prospect for continued growth in the portfolio for 2024 and the coming years. The driver for near and long term growth in cash flow will come from the large deposits of Caserones in Chile and Timok in Serbia. At Caserones, Lundin has initiated an exploration program which is intended to expand mineral resources and mineral reserves while at the same time looking to increase throughput at the plant. At Timok, Zijin Mining Group Co. continues to advance the upper zones while developing the lower zone, which we believe will be one of the more important block cave development projects in the world. Regarding the gold royalty portfolio, we expect Gediktepe, Leeville, and Gold Bar to mirror what occurred in 2023. In Türkiye, the operator of Sisorta is nearing completion of construction of the mine and we look forward to seeing the plant commissioned. We are excited about the advancement of Diablillos in Argentina by AbraSilver Resource Corp. where the company continues to expand the mineral resource. In Sweden the Viscaria copper-gold deposit (operated by Copperstone Resources AB) continues to advance through the environmental permitting process with a final decision expected by mid-year 2024. Pending approval, Copperstone expects to commence development with initial production from Viscaria slated for 2026.The Company will continue to evaluate and work to acquire mineral rights and royalties in 2024. The Company expects it will invest similar amounts as in 2023 towards the royalty generation business. As in previous years, production royalties will continue to be supplemented by option, advance royalty, and other pre-production payments from partnered projects across the global asset portfolio. Efforts and programs are underway to optimize and control costs as the Company continues to grow. EMX believes it is well positioned to identify and pursue new royalty and investment opportunities, while further filling a pipeline of royalty generation properties that provide opportunities for additional cash flow, as well as exploration, development, and production success.1 Refer to the ""Non-IFRS financial measures"" section below and on page 53 of the Q4 2024 MD&A for more information on each non-IFRS financial measure. With respect to forward-looking non-IFRS financial measures, there are no significant differences with the calculation of historical non-IFRS financial measures.The Company will also strive towards continuing to strengthen its balance sheet over the course of the year. As part of this effort we will look to refinance our outstanding debt of $34,660,000, which comes due at the end of 2024. The Company has actively been engaged with several parties and believes that it will be in a position to provide an update to this process in Q2 2024. Assumed commodity prices are from CIBC Global Mining Group's Consensus Commodity Price Forecasts published on January 2, 2024, which the Company believes to be reliable for the purposes of guidance. Annual Results for 2023:In 2023, the Company recognized $37,028,000 and $30,694,000 in adjusted revenue and other income1 and adjusted royalty revenue1, respectively, which represented a 46% and 119% increase, respectively, compared to 2022. The significant increase is due to the commencement of royalty payments from the Timok royalty property, which resulted in $8,632,000 in royalty revenue in 2023, as well as an 80% increase in royalty revenue from Gediktepe and 46% increase in attributed royalty revenue from Caserones. Timok royalty revenue for 2023 included $4,790,000 in revenue (2,483 GEOs1 sold) for 2021 and 2022 production.

The increase in costs was due to increases in the USA, Eastern Europe and Morocco. In the USA, the Company executed drilling activities through its wholly owned subsidiary Scout Drilling LLC on partnered projects in exchange for future reimbursement or royalty opportunities. Scout Drilling LLC was sold during the year along with certain mineral properties to Scout Discoveries Corp (""Scout"") in exchange for deferred compensation payments, shares in Scout and royalty rights on the properties, which exceeded the costs incurred. The increase in Eastern Europe and Morocco was attributed to the expansion of the generative business into Morocco and the Balkan region. EMX expects the costs in Morocco and the Balkan region to decrease in the coming years once it solidifies partnerships within the regions. Not inclusive of the net royalty generation and project evaluation cost, EMX earned $5,462,000 in royalty generation revenue in 2023 (2022 - $6,447,000).1Refer to the ""Non-IFRS financial measures"" section below and on page 53 of the Q4 2024 MD&A for more information on each non-IFRS financial measure.Fourth Quarter Adjusted Royalty Revenue and GEOs Sold by Asset:For the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recognized $8,744,000 in adjusted royalty revenue, which represented a 213% increase compared to Q4 2022. The significant increase is due to the commencement of royalty payments from Timok, Balya and Gold Bar South in 2023, combined with significant increases from Caserones, Gediktepe and Leeville. Revenue in Q4 2023 at Caserones included a year-to-date true-up of revenue due to higher than expected performance in Q3 2023.

Forward-looking statements are based on a number of material assumptions, including those listed below, which could prove to be significantly incorrect, including disruption to production at any of the mineral properties in which the Company has a royalty, or other interest; estimated capital costs, operating costs, production and economic returns; estimated metal pricing (including the estimates from the CIBC Global Mining Group's Consensus Commodity Price Forecasts published on January 2, 2024), metallurgy, mineability, marketability and operating and capital costs, together with other assumptions underlying the Company's resource and reserve estimates; the expected ability of any of the properties in which the Company holds a royalty, or other interest to develop adequate infrastructure at a reasonable cost; assumptions that all necessary permits and governmental approvals will remain in effect or be obtained as required to operate, develop or explore the various properties in which the Company holds an interest; and the activities on any on the properties in which the Company holds a royalty, or other interest will not be adversely disrupted or impeded by development, operating or regulatory risks or any other government actions. Certain important factors that could cause actual results, performances or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, amongst others, failure to maintain or receive necessary approvals, changes in business plans and strategies, market conditions, share price, best use of available cash, copper, gold and other commodity price volatility, discrepancies between actual and estimated production, mineral reserves and resources and metallurgical recoveries, mining operational and development risks relating to the parties which produce the gold or other commodity the Company will purchase, regulatory restrictions, activities by governmental authorities (including changes in taxation), currency fluctuations, the global economic climate, dilution, share price volatility and competition. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including but not limited to: the impact of general business and economic conditions, the absence of control over mining operations from which the Company will receive royalties from, and risks related to those mining operations, including risks related to international operations, government and environmental regulation, actual results of current exploration activities, conclusions of economic evaluations and changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined, risks in the marketability of minerals, fluctuations in the price of gold and other commodities, fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, stock market volatility, as well as those factors discussed in the Company's MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the most recently filed Annual Information Form (""AIF"") for the year ended December 31, 2023, actual events may differ materially from current expectations. More information about the Company, including the MD&A, the AIF and financial statements of the Company, is available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and on the SEC's EDGAR website at www.sec.gov. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that are contained or incorporated by reference, except in accordance with applicable securities laws.Future-Oriented Financial Information This news release may contain future-oriented financial information (""FOFI"") within the meaning of Canadian securities legislation, about prospective results of operations, financial position, GEOs and anticipated royalty payments based on assumptions about future economic conditions and courses of action, which FOFI is not presented in the format of a historical balance sheet, income statement or cash flow statement. The FOFI has been prepared by management to provide an outlook of the Company's activities and results and has been prepared based on a number of assumptions including the assumptions discussed under the headings above entitled ""2024 Guidance"", ""Outlook"" and ""Forward-Looking Statements"" and assumptions with respect to the future metal prices, the estimation of mineral reserves and resources, realization of mineral reserve estimates and the timing and amount of estimated future production. Management does not have, or may not have had at the relevant date, or other financial assumptions which may have been used to prepare the FOFI or assurance that such operating results will be achieved and, accordingly, the complete financial effects are not, or may not have been at the relevant date of the FOFI, objectively determinable.Importantly, the FOFI contained in this news release are, or may be, based upon certain additional assumptions that management believes to be reasonable based on the information currently available to management, including, but not limited to, assumptions about: (i) the future pricing of metals, (ii) the future market demand and trends within the jurisdictions in which the Company or the mining operators operate, and (iii) the operating cost and effect on the production of the Company's royalty partners. The FOFI or financial outlook contained in this news release do not purport to present the Company's financial condition in accordance with IFRS, and there can be no assurance that the assumptions made in preparing the FOFI will prove accurate. The actual results of operations of the Company and the resulting financial results will likely vary from the amounts set forth in the analysis presented in any such document, and such variation may be material (including due to the occurrence of unforeseen events occurring subsequent to the preparation of the FOFI). The Company and management believe that the FOFI has been prepared on a reasonable basis, reflecting management's best estimates and judgments as at the applicable date. However, because this information is highly subjective and subject to numerous risks including the risks discussed under the heading above entitled ""Forward-Looking Statements"" and under the heading ""Risk Factors"" in the Company's public disclosures, FOFI or financial outlook within this news release should not be relied on as necessarily indicative of future results. Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresWe have included certain non-IFRS financial measures in this press release, as discussed below. We believe that these measures, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, provide investors an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. These non-IFRS financial measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers. Non-IFRS financial measures are defined in National Instrument 52-112 - Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures Disclosure (""NI 52-112"") as a financial measure disclosed that (a) depicts the historical or expected future financial performance, financial position or cash flow of an entity, (b) with respect to its composition, excludes an amount that is included in, or includes an amount that is excluded from, the composition of the most directly comparable financial measure disclosed in the primary financial statements of the entity, (c) is not disclosed in the financial statements of the entity, and (d) is not a ratio, fraction, percentage or similar representation. A non-IFRS ratio is defined by NI 52-112 as a financial measure disclosed that (a) is in the form of a ratio, fraction, percentage or similar representation, (b) has a non-IFRS financial measure as one or more of its components, and (c) is not disclosed in the financial statements. The following table outlines the non-IFRS financial measures, their definitions, the most directly comparable IFRS measures and why we use these measures.Non-IFRS financial measure Definition Most directly comparable IFRS measure Why we use the measure and why it is useful to investorsAdjusted revenue and other income Defined as revenue and other income including the Company's share of royalty revenue related to the Company's effective royalty on Caserones. Revenue and other income We believe these measures more accurately depict the Company's revenue related to operations as the adjustment is to account for revenue from a material asset.Adjusted royalty revenue Defined as royalty revenue including the Company's share of royalty revenue related to the Company's effective royalty on Caserones. Royalty revenue Adjusted cash flows from operating activities Defined as cash flows from operating activities plus the cash distributions related to the Company's effective royalty on Caserones. Cash flows from operating activities We believe this measure more accurately depicts the Company's cash flows from operations as the adjustment is to account for cash flows from a material asset.Gold equivalent ounces (GEOs) GEOs is a non-IFRS measure that is based on royalty interests and calculated on a quarterly basis by dividing adjusted royalty revenue by the average gold price during such quarter. The gold price is determined based on the LBMA PM fix. For periods longer than one quarter, GEOs are summed for each quarter in the period. Royalty revenue We use this measure internally to evaluate our underlying operating performance across the royalty portfolio for the reporting periods presented and to assist with the planning and forecasting of future operating results.

Completes Proprietary Reverse Mortgage Loan Securitization Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Ellington Financial Inc. (EFC) closes a $208 million securitization backed by proprietary reverse mortgage loans originated by Longbridge Financial. Morningstar DBRS rates the senior tranches AAA(sf). Company retains certain tranches and the option to call the securitization. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The closing of a $208 million securitization by Ellington Financial Inc. signifies a strategic move in capital management. The securitization process allows the company to convert illiquid assets into a more liquid form, thus enhancing their financial flexibility. By backing the securitization with reverse mortgage loans, the company is tapping into a niche market with a unique risk-return profile.The AAA(sf) rating assigned to the senior tranches by Morningstar DBRS indicates a high level of confidence in the credit quality of the underlying assets. This can be attractive to investors seeking stable, investment-grade securities. However, the retention of certain tranches as per credit risk retention rules suggests that Ellington is maintaining skin in the game, aligning their interests with those of the investors.The option to call the securitization post-redemption date provides Ellington with strategic leeway to manage the securitization based on market conditions and their capital needs. Overall, this securitization could signal a positive outlook for Ellington's financial health and might influence the market's perception of the company's stock. Risk Management Expert Securitization inherently involves a transfer of risk from the originator to the investors. In the case of proprietary reverse mortgage loans, the risk profile is distinct due to the nature of the borrowers and the real estate market's volatility. The retention of certain tranches by Ellington Financial indicates a deliberate risk management strategy to ensure compliance with credit risk retention rules, which can be seen as a commitment to maintaining a quality loan pool.Investors should be aware that while the senior tranches have received AAA(sf) ratings, indicating low credit risk, the performance of these securities is still contingent upon the borrowers' ability to meet their obligations and the stability of the housing market. The servicer, Longbridge Financial, plays a critical role in managing these loans and their continued involvement post-securitization is essential to maintain the integrity of the servicing process. Market Research Analyst The securitization market for reverse mortgages is not as large or liquid as other mortgage-backed securities. This move by Ellington Financial could be indicative of an attempt to create more liquidity in this sector and potentially stimulate broader investor interest. The choice of Longbridge Financial to continue servicing the loans is strategic, as it leverages existing operational capabilities and market knowledge.Market response to such securitizations can vary, but the AAA(sf) ratings could bolster investor confidence. However, it remains essential to monitor how the market absorbs this new issuance and whether it leads to a re-rating of Ellington's own credit profile. The impact on the stock price will likely depend on investor appetite for reverse mortgage-backed securities and the overall market conditions at the time of issuance and beyond. 03/25/2024 - 04:23 PM OLD GREENWICH, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ellington Financial Inc.

(""Gold Mountain"" or the ""Company"") (TSX:GMTN)(OTCQB:GMTNF)(FRA:5XFA) announces that it has reached agreements with two secured creditors for the settlement and postponement of certain secured debts (the ""Debt Settlements""). The secured creditors are Nhwelmen Construction LP Ltd. (""Nhwelmen"") who is currently owed $7,784,850.71 (the ""Nhwelmen Secured Debt"") and Hedge Minerals Corp.(""Hedge"") who is currently owed $1,241,669.18 (the ""Hedge Secured Debt"").Nhwelmen is the contract miner at the Company's Elk Gold Mine, and Hedge is an arms-length lender to the Company pursuant to a loan arrangement entered into effective September 13, 2023. Nhwelmen has agreed to accept common shares of the Company in payment of $1,250,000 of the Nhwelmen Secured Debt at an issuance price of $0.0075 per share (the ""Issue Price""), which pricing is at a discount to market price (for a maximum of 166,666,667 common shares being issued to Nhwelmen), and the remaining amount of the Nhwelmen Secured Debt will be repaid in equal cash payments over 24 months commencing in April, 2024 and including interest at a rate of 18% per annum. The entire Hedge Secured Debt will be repaid through the issuance of common shares of the Company at the Issue Price (for a maximum of 165,555,891 common shares being issued to Hedge).The Company has also approached certain unsecured vendors who provide critical services to the Company for the conversion of up to $1.5 million of unsecured debt for settlement of such debts in payment of common shares of the Company at the Issue Price for a maximum issuance of 200,000,000 common shares.Further, the Company is pleased to announce a non-brokered private placement (the ""Private Placement"") of up to 100,000,000 common shares in the capital of the Company at the Issue Price for gross proceeds to the Company of up to $750,000, which would represent a maximum of up to 14.28% of the Company's issued and outstanding common shares following the issuance of common shares with respect to the Debt Settlements. The common shares issued are subject to applicable resale restrictions, including a hold period of four months and one day from the closing of the Private Placement under Canadian securities rules. The Private Placement is subject to customary closing conditions including final Toronto Stock Exchange (""TSX"") approval. Proceeds of the Private Placement will be used to ramp up operations at the Elk Gold Mine and for working capital and general corporate purposes. No insiders of the Company will be participating in the Private Placement.Insider ParticipationNone of the creditors currently own (directly or indirectly) any securities of the Company. Upon completion of the Debt Settlements (assuming no settlement of unsecured debts and prior to closing of the Private Placement) Hedge would own 39.38% of the Company's common shares (non-diluted) and Nhwelmen would own 39.65% of the Company's common shares (non-diluted). Assuming settlement of all $1.5 million of the unsecured debt and closing of the Private Placement of $750,000 in gross proceeds, Hedge would own 23.64%, Nhwelmen would own 23.80% and the unsecured creditors would own 28.60% the Company's common shares, all on a non-diluted basis. As a result of such ownership, Nhwelmen and Hedge will become ""insiders"" of the Company for purposes of the TSX Company Manual and a ""related party"" of the Company pursuant to Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (""MI 61-101""). Depending on the participation of the unsecured creditors, such unsecured creditors may also become ""insiders"" and ""related parties"" and the Company will make such disclosure in future press releases once determined. The Debt Settlements will result in a change of control of the Company as both Nhwelmen and Hedge will become control persons in the Company, owning more than 20% of the current issued and outstanding. The Company does not anticipate that any of subscribers pursuant to the Private Placement will become ""insiders"" or ""related parties"" of the Company.The Debt Settlement is a ""related party transaction"" within the meaning of MI 61-101. However, in light of the fact that the Board and Special Committee have determined that the Company is in serious financial difficulty and that the Debt Settlement is designed to improve the Company's financial situation, the Company is relying on the exemption from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements of MI 61-101 contained in Section 5.5(g) and Section 5.7(1)(e) of MI 61-101, respectively, on the basis of the ""financial hardship"" exemption therein.Special CommitteeA special committee of the board of directors of the Company (the ""Special Committee"") was constituted and considered the fairness of the Debt Settlements and related matters. The Special Committee is comprised of two independent directors. The Special Committee has determined that the Debt Settlements are reasonable for the Company in the circumstances and recommends that the Company proceed with the Debt Settlement.The Special Committee carefully considered management's efforts in recent years in exploring various alternatives to improve the financial situation of the Company and considered whether other alternatives may be available (e.g., various corporate transactions, M&A transaction with third parties, accessing public or private debt or equity markets). The Special Committee has concluded that the Company is in serious financial difficulty and there are no viable alternatives available on commercially reasonable terms that would be more likely to improve the financial situation of the Company compared to the Debt Settlement (and related transactions).Financial Hardship ExemptionAs the Debt Settlement will: (i) result in the issuance of shares to Hedge and Nhwelmen in an amount greater than 25% of the number of common shares outstanding and materially effect control of the Company (section 604(a)(i) of the TSX Company Manual); (ii) dilute the Company's market capitalization by more than 25% (section 607(g)(i) of the TSX Company Manual); and (iii) the issuance of common shares in the Debt Transactions and Private Placement are being priced lower than market price less the maximum applicable discount (section 607(e) of the TSX Company Manual), disinterested shareholder approval and an independent report regarding the value of the transaction consideration is required. However, the Company has applied to the TSX for a ""financial hardship"" exemption from the requirements to obtain disinterested shareholder approval and an independent valuation report on the basis that the Company is in serious financial difficulty and the Debt Settlement is designed to improve the Company's financial situation. The application was made upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, free from any interest in the Debt Settlement and unrelated to the parties involved in such transactions (other than the Company) and was based on its determination that the Debt Settlement is reasonable for the Company in the circumstances.There is no certainty that the terms of the Debt Settlement will be acceptable to any of the unsecured vendors.The Company anticipates that a resolution will be put to shareholders approving a share consolidation at its next Annual Meeting.Appointment of DirectorThe Company's Chief Executive Officer, Ronald Woo, has been appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company effective immediately.

Maxeon Solar Technologies Initiates TOPCon Patent Infringement Lawsuit,2024-03-25T20:15:00.000Z,Neutral,Positive,"Maxeon Solar Technologies,  (MAXN) initiates a patent infringement lawsuit against Canadian Solar, Inc. in the Eastern District of Texas. The lawsuit alleges infringement of Maxeon patents related to TOPCon solar cell technology. Maxeon emphasizes its commitment to enforcing patent rights globally, backed by a robust patent portfolio of over 1,650 granted patents and 330 pending applications.","Maxeon Solar Technologies Initiates TOPCon Patent Infringement Lawsuit Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Maxeon Solar Technologies, (MAXN) initiates a patent infringement lawsuit against Canadian Solar, Inc. in the Eastern District of Texas. The lawsuit alleges infringement of Maxeon patents related to TOPCon solar cell technology. Maxeon emphasizes its commitment to enforcing patent rights globally, backed by a robust patent portfolio of over 1,650 granted patents and 330 pending applications. Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert Patent litigation, such as the case initiated by Maxeon Solar Technologies against Canadian Solar, can have significant implications for the companies involved and the solar industry at large. Intellectual property (IP) rights are pivotal for companies to secure a competitive advantage, especially in high-tech sectors like solar energy where innovation is a key differentiator. The assertion of over 1,650 granted patents by Maxeon underscores the company's commitment to protect its technological advancements, which could deter potential infringements and encourage licensing agreements.However, the legal process is often lengthy and uncertain. The outcome of this lawsuit could influence both companies' market positions, financial health and R&D strategies. If Maxeon succeeds, it could potentially receive substantial damages and hinder Canadian Solar's ability to compete in the U.S. market. Conversely, a loss for Maxeon could weaken its IP enforcement strategy and possibly impact investor confidence. Stakeholders should monitor this development, as it may affect stock valuations and long-term industry dynamics. Market Research Analyst Maxeon's initiation of a patent infringement lawsuit against a major competitor like Canadian Solar indicates a strategic move to safeguard its proprietary TOPCon solar cell technology. This litigation could signal to the market Maxeon's aggressive stance on defending its IP, potentially shaping perceptions of the company as a leader in solar innovation. The emphasis on TOPCon technology, which improves solar cell efficiency, reflects the industry's focus on advancing solar panel performance to meet growing global energy demands.Should Maxeon's action result in a favorable ruling, it may lead to a shift in market shares within the solar industry, as competitors may need to navigate around Maxeon's patents or seek licensing agreements. This could also lead to increased costs for competitors and possibly higher prices for end-users. Investors should consider the possible repercussions of this lawsuit on the industry's competitive landscape and supply chain dynamics when evaluating the solar sector. Financial Analyst The financial implications of Maxeon's patent infringement lawsuit are multifaceted. Legal proceedings can be expensive and the costs incurred will likely affect Maxeon's short-term financials. However, the potential long-term benefits of enforcing IP rights could outweigh these initial expenses. A win could result in monetary compensation and strengthen Maxeon's negotiating power in potential licensing deals, which could be a new revenue stream.On the other hand, the uncertainty surrounding the lawsuit's outcome may introduce volatility in Maxeon's stock price. Investors typically react to such news with caution and the company's market capitalization might experience fluctuations as the case progresses. It is also essential to consider the broader impact on the solar industry's investment climate, as heightened IP disputes could increase the perceived risk of investing in solar technology companies. 03/25/2024 - 04:15 PM SINGAPORE, March 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Maxeon Solar Technologies, Ltd. (NASDAQ:MAXN), a global leader in solar innovation and channels, today announced that it has initiated a patent infringement lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas against Canadian Solar, Inc., alleging infringement of Maxeon patents relating to TOPCon (Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact) solar cell technology.

The company focused on streamlining operations, reducing costs, and investing in new clinical programs. Despite a net loss of $8.2M, Tivic received accolades for innovation and bioelectronic medicine. The company conducted a pilot clinical study on vagus nerve stimulation and plans to create new value paths for shareholders. Positive Tivic Health® Systems, Inc. announced a decrease in revenue for 2023 compared to 2022, with net sales of $1.2M. The company reported a gross profit of $330 thousand for 2023, showing an improvement over the previous year. Tivic focused on optimizing its commercial business by implementing a new pricing structure, reducing costs, and enhancing marketing efficiency. The company invested in clinical programs for vagus nerve stimulation and opiate-use reduction following sinus and facial surgeries. Tivic was recognized as one of the World’s Most Innovative Companies for 2023 in the Medical Device category by Fast Company. The company's net loss for 2023 was $8.2M, a decrease from $10.1M in 2022. Tivic conducted a pilot clinical study on non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation, the results of which are pending. The company maintained a no debt balance sheet and had $3.4 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023. Tivic conducted financing activities in 2023, including public offerings that resulted in net proceeds of approximately $7.9M. The company will file its MD&A and consolidated financial statements for 2023 with the SEC on March 25, 2024. Negative The revenue for Tivic Health® Systems, Inc. decreased by 36% in 2023 compared to 2022. The company experienced a net loss of $8.2M for the full year of 2023. Research and development expenses remained consistent at approximately $1.7M for both 2023 and 2022. Sales and marketing expenses decreased in 2023, attributed to a reduction in advertising and agency costs. General and administrative expenses also decreased in 2023 due to reductions in legal and professional fees. Tivic Health® Systems, Inc. conducted a 1-for-100 reverse stock split in August 2023. The company regained compliance with NASDAQ's minimum bid price continued listing requirement in September 2023. Financial Analyst The financial results reported by Tivic Health indicate a challenging fiscal year, with a significant 36% decline in revenue and a net loss of $8.2M. The decrease in revenue is attributed to a substantial drop in unit sales, although this was somewhat mitigated by a higher average selling price per unit. This suggests that while the company's pricing strategy may have positively influenced the revenue per unit, the overall market demand for their product has weakened.Cost-saving measures such as reducing the cost of goods, improving marketing efficiency and decreasing headcount were important in reducing the net loss compared to the previous year. However, investors should consider the sustainability of these measures in the long term, especially as the company continues to invest in research and development, which remained steady at $1.7M. The company's move to open new channels directed at less price-sensitive healthcare segments could be a strategic attempt to diversify revenue streams, but the effectiveness of this approach remains to be seen.Financing activities, including a public stock offering and a reverse stock split, indicate efforts to improve capital structure and maintain NASDAQ listing compliance. While these actions have provided short-term liquidity, the dilutive effect on existing shareholders and the potential pressure on stock price should be carefully evaluated. With $3.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and a no debt balance sheet, Tivic appears to have some financial runway, but the burn rate and future capital needs should be monitored closely by investors. Medical Research Analyst The development and commercialization of bioelectronic medicine, such as Tivic's ClearUP Sinus Pain Relief, represent a growing area in healthcare technology. The company's investment in a new platform for vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) could be significant, as VNS has potential applications in various medical conditions beyond sinus pain relief. The successful completion of study enrollment for the pilot clinical study is a positive step forward, but without the results, it's difficult to assess the potential impact on the company's product pipeline and long-term value creation.Moreover, the company's strategic focus on opiate-use reduction following sinus and facial surgeries taps into the broader societal need to address opioid dependency. If Tivic's approach proves effective, it could position the company favorably in an important public health area. However, the outcomes of these investments are uncertain and hinge on future clinical success and market acceptance.Recognition by Fast Company and Global Health & Pharma hints at Tivic's innovation and potential in the bioelectronic medicine field, yet such accolades do not directly translate into financial success. Stakeholders should weigh these recognitions against tangible financial and clinical outcomes when assessing the company's prospects. 03/25/2024 - 05:25 PM SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tivic Health® Systems, Inc. (“Tivic”, Nasdaq: TIVC), a health tech company that develops and commercializes bioelectronic medicine, today announced its financial results for the year ending December 31, 2023. Tivic’s commercial platform is a handheld design that interfaces non-invasively with the trigeminal, sympathetic, and other facial and cranial nerve structures. This platform is the basis for Tivic’s existing product, currently marketed with FDA approval as ClearUP Sinus Pain Relief, for the treatment of sinus pain and congestion. In 2023, the company also began investment in a new platform for vagus nerve stimulation. Study enrollment for the pilot clinical study of a proprietary approach to non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) was completed on in February 2024. Results of the study have not yet been announced. “2023 was a year for both streamlining our commercial business and defining new opportunities for value creation,” stated Jennifer Ernst, CEO of Tivic. ""We have taken substantial steps towards improving the company’s financial health by implementing a new pricing structure on our commercial product, reducing costs of goods, improving marketing efficiency, and decreasing headcount to align with current revenue. We opened new channels directed to less price-sensitive healthcare segments. And, we strategically invested in clinical programs to create new paths for value creation for our shareholders, including a program in vagus nerve stimulation and one targeted to opiate-use reduction following sinus and facial surgeries."" As a result, the company was named to Fast Company’s prestigious annual list of the World’s Most Innovative Companies for 2023 in the Medical Device category and Global Health & Pharma (GHP) named Tivic Health the Most Pioneering Bioelectronic Medicine Company. 2023 Financial Performance Revenue (net of returns) for 2023 was $1.2M compared to $1.8M for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease of $664 thousand, or 36%, was due to a 52% decrease in ClearUP unit sales, offset by 46% higher average selling price per unit. Greater than 90% of sales were direct to consumer in 2023. Cost of sales was $889 thousand in 2023 compared to $1.5M for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $652 thousand, or 42%. The decrease was due to the 52% decrease in overall unit sales, offset by $172 thousand of costs related to write-offs or reserves on old inventory and components primarily related to our ClearUP 1.0 units as our ClearUP 2.0 units began shipping in December of 2023. We do not expect to incur similar costs in 2024. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $330 thousand compared to a gross profit of $299 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022. Research and development expenses were approximately $1.7M for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The emphasis of research and development activities in 2023 was primarily related to our work with The Feinstein Institutes. Sales and marketing expenses decreased to $2.1M for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $2.8M for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to reduction of advertising and agency costs. General and administrative expenses decreased to $4.8M in 2023, compared to $5.9M for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in legal and professional fees and other corporate expenses as the company worked to reduce overhead costs. As a result, our 2023 full year net loss was $8.2M, compared to $10.1M in 2022. Regarding 2023 financing activities, on February 13, 2023, we sold shares of common stock to investors in a registered public offering, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $3.6M. From July 11, 2023 to August 9, 2023, we sold shares of common stock to investors in a series of registered public offerings, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to the company of approximately $4.3M. On August 23, 2023, we implemented a 1-for-100 reverse stock split, and on September 15, 2023, we received confirmation from NASDAQ that we had regained compliance with the minimum bid price continued listing requirement. As of December 31, 2023, the company had $3.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and we continued to maintain a no debt balance sheet. The company’s MD&A and consolidated financial statements for the year-ended December 31, 2023 will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 25, 2024 with the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(BKKT) reports quarterly gross crypto services revenues of $199.4 million, total revenues of $214.5 million, and full year total revenues of $780.1 million. The company also announced a recent closing of $42.4 million in gross proceeds from offerings with third-party investors and Intercontinental Exchange to enhance liquidity. Bakkt plans to expand institutional crypto capabilities and anticipates significant revenue growth for 2024. Positive Bakkt reported strong quarterly and full-year financial results, with significant revenues from crypto services. The company completed a successful closing of $42.4 million in gross proceeds from offerings to improve liquidity. Bakkt aims to expand institutional crypto capabilities and expects substantial revenue growth for 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financials by Bakkt Holdings, Inc. indicate a significant discrepancy between gross crypto services revenues and the associated costs. With a mere $2 million difference, the slim margin highlights the intense competition and price pressure within the cryptocurrency services sector. Investors should note that despite the expansion of institutional crypto capabilities and the launch of new services, the operating expenses are notably high at $293.0 million, which may raise concerns about the company's cost structure and efficiency.However, the 55% year-over-year reduction in operating expenses, excluding certain costs, suggests aggressive cost management that could improve profitability if sustained. The initial closing of $42.4 million in funding is a positive sign, indicating investor confidence and a stronger liquidity position. Yet, the wide range in the full year 2024 revenue outlook ($3,292 million to $5,114 million) may imply uncertainty in forecasting, a common challenge in the volatile crypto market. Market Research Analyst Bakkt's strategic focus on expanding its client network and product set is a move to capture a larger market share within the cryptocurrency services industry. The upcoming launch of institutional trading services could position the company to capitalize on the growing demand for crypto-related financial services among institutional investors.However, the market for such services is becoming increasingly crowded, with competitors like Coinbase and Binance also vying for institutional clients. Bakkt's success will largely depend on its ability to differentiate its offerings and provide superior value. The anticipated significant revenue growth for 2024 suggests that the company is expecting to benefit from these strategic initiatives, but this projection should be viewed with caution given the historical volatility of the crypto markets and regulatory uncertainties. Economist The financial results of Bakkt Holdings reflect broader economic trends affecting the cryptocurrency industry, such as market volatility and regulatory scrutiny. The company's focus on reducing operating cash flow usage by approximately 70% year-over-year aligns with a more conservative financial approach, likely in response to the economic headwinds faced by the tech and crypto sectors.While the expansion into institutional crypto services is a strategic move to diversify revenue streams, it also exposes the company to the cyclical nature of institutional investment flows. The expected growth in total revenues for the full year 2024 is ambitious and may be contingent on the broader economic environment, which includes interest rates, inflation and investor sentiment towards risk assets like cryptocurrencies. 03/25/2024 - 04:20 PM Quarterly gross crypto services revenues of $199.4 million and associated crypto costs and execution, clearing and brokerage fees of $197.8 million Quarterly total revenues of $214.5 million include gross crypto revenues and net loyalty revenues; full year total revenues of $780.1 million Quarterly total operating expenses of $293.0 million.

(“Bakkt”) (NYSE: BKKT) announced its financial and operational results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. “Bakkt has built a robust foundation and we are in a prime position as we enter the next phase of our journey to commercialize our platform and scale our business,” said Andy Main, incoming President and Chief Executive Officer of Bakkt. “Our focus for 2024 is on a set of strategic initiatives that will provide our business with efficient scale, including broadening our client network, expanding our product set and prudently managing expenses. With our newly strengthened balance sheet which helped put us in a position to alleviate the conditions that raised doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and improving crypto market conditions, we are excited about the opportunities in 2024 to execute on our key priorities and drive our company towards profitability. It is an honor to become the Chief Executive Officer of Bakkt and have the opportunity to lead the organization at this pivotal moment in the company’s journey.” Our 2024 key priorities include: 1. Broaden client network and deepen existing relationships – continue recent momentum in expanding and activating our client network. Our recently signed new retail and institutional clients include Bitcoin ETF providers, crypto native companies, neobanks and fintechs. Continue to execute on international “land and expand” strategy, including Latin America, Spain, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan where our crypto capabilities are currently live. 2. Expand our products and solutions – we plan to leverage our newly enhanced secure, compliant and trusted institutional-grade custody platform as a secure foundation to build incremental higher margin complementary institutional crypto solutions. We recently launched Collaborative Custody and expect to launch institutional trading in Q3 2024. These complementary products are expected to provide attractive opportunities to significantly grow revenue with minimal costs. We will be able to efficiently bring new institutional capabilities to market by leveraging our strategic partnerships, while requiring minimal internal technology development work and resources. Collaborative Custody - we are partnering with Unchained Capital, a prominent player in collaborative custody, to provide multi-signature wallets and key management services, contributing to enhanced security for digital asset storage; and Institutional trading - we plan to launch a high-performance, low-cost, institutional trading venue. This trading venue will be in the form of an Electronic Communication Network (“ECN”), which is a technology-based solution that automatically matches and executes trades with best available pricing and high-speed performance. We expect to deliver an institutional-grade trading experience for our clients with this new offering. 3. Prudent expense management – continue to reduce our operating expenses through prudent firmwide expense management initiatives. Our second half 2023 operating expenses excluding crypto costs, execution, clearing and brokerage fees and goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets impairments were down 42% from the first half of 2023. We expect full year 2024 operating expenses to decline 13-18% year-over-year as we remain focused on preserving our strong balance sheet with prudent expense management and judicious capital allocation decisions. Full Year 2024 Outlook Full year 2024 revenues expected to be $3,292 million - $5,114 million; includes gross crypto revenues of $3,239 million -$5,057 million and net loyalty revenues of $53 million - $57 million. Full year 2024 crypto costs expected to be $3,220 million - $5,027 million, in line with gross crypto revenues. Full year 2024 total operating expenses excluding crypto costs, execution, clearing and brokerage fees and goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets impairments expected to be $160 million - $170 million. Full year 2024 net cash used in operating activities expected to be ($58 million) – ($72 million). Full year 2024 free cash flow usage (non-GAAP) expected to be ($65 million) - ($79 million). End of year cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities of $35 million - $50 million.

Transacting accounts of 915,000 decreased 39% year-over-year, due to industrywide slowdown in crypto activity. Notional traded volume of $442 million decreased 35% year-over-year, primarily due to lower activity levels from Webull Pay customers and lower loyalty redemption activity in merchandise, travel and gift cards. Assets under custody of $702 million increased 41% year-over-year, due to higher coin prices. Total revenues of $214.5 million reflect a significant increase in gross crypto services revenues driven by our acquisition of Bakkt Crypto. Net loyalty revenues of $15.1 million decreased 4% year-over-year driven by lower service revenue. Total operating expenses of $293.0 million reflect a significant increase in crypto costs and execution, clearing and brokerage fees driven by our acquisition of Bakkt Crypto. Fourth quarter expenses included non-cash intangible assets impairments of $37.2 million and non-cash long-lived assets impairments of $30.2 million. These charges were recognized in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and a result of various analyses, including fair valuing our intangible assets, lower growth expectations for the loyalty business and cash flow analyses. Operating loss of $78.5 million decreased year-over-year due to larger goodwill and intangible assets impairments recorded in the prior year. Net loss of $78.7 million decreased year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA loss (non-GAAP) of $19.0 million decreased 38% year-over-year primarily due to a reduction in compensation and benefits costs.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, acquisition-related expenses, share-based and unit-based compensation expense, goodwill and intangible assets impairments, restructuring charges, changes in the fair value of our warrant liability and certain other non-cash and/or non-recurring items that do not contribute directly to our evaluation of operating results and are not components of our core business operations. Adjusted EBITDA provides management with an understanding of earnings before the impact of investing and financing transactions and income taxes, and the effects of aforementioned items that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations. This measure may be useful to an investor in evaluating our performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly tied measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures like Adjusted EBITDA have limitations, should be considered as supplemental in nature and are not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered alongside other financial performance measures, including net loss and our other financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.

Free Cash Flow is cash flow from operations adjusted for “capitalized internal use software development costs and other capital expenditures” and “interest income.” We adjust for capitalized expenses associated with internally developed software for our technology platforms given they are a large component of our ongoing expense base given our position as a technology platform company. Information reconciling forward-looking Free Cash Flow to the comparable GAAP financial measure is unavailable to us without unreasonable effort. We are not able to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking Free Cash Flow to the comparable GAAP financial measure because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, such as timing of customer payments for account receivables and payment terms for operating expenses. Preparation of such reconciliations would require a forward-looking statement of income and statement of cash flow, prepared in accordance with GAAP, and such forward-looking financial statements are unavailable to us without unreasonable effort (as specified in the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K). We provide a range for our Free Cash Flow forecast that we believe will be achieved, however we cannot accurately predict all the components of the Free Cash Flow calculation. We provide a Free Cash Flow because we believe that Free Cash Flow, when viewed with our results under GAAP, provides useful information for the reasons noted above. However, Free Cash Flow is not a measure of liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as an alternative to net cash used in operating activities as an indicator of liquidity.

The offering is managed by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Morgan Stanley, RBC Capital Markets, and Compass Point. Positive Trinity Capital Inc. is addressing its debt obligations by issuing $100.0 million in 7.875% notes due 2029. The company plans to use the net proceeds to pay down existing debt under its KeyBank Credit Facility and potentially redeem a portion of its 7.00% Notes due 2025. The offering is managed by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Morgan Stanley, RBC Capital Markets, and Compass Point. Investors are advised to review the investment objectives, risks, and expenses outlined in the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus filed with the SEC. Negative None. Financial Analyst The issuance of $100 million in 7.875% notes by Trinity Capital Inc. reflects a strategic move to restructure the company's debt profile. The interest rate offered is notably higher than the average corporate bond yield, suggesting that Trinity may be compensating for higher perceived risk or seeking to attract investors with a more appealing return. The option to redeem these notes starting from 2026 indicates flexibility in debt management, which could be a positive signal to investors about the company's financial planning.From a financial standpoint, the decision to pay down existing debt under the KeyBank Credit Facility could potentially lead to a reduction in interest expenses, depending on the interest rates of the existing debt. This action could improve Trinity's net interest margins and, consequently, its profitability. However, investors should be aware that such debt restructuring could also lead to temporary increases in leverage ratios until the proceeds are effectively used to reduce outstanding debt levels. Market Research Analyst Trinity's decision to list the new notes on the Nasdaq Global Select Market is indicative of their aim to enhance liquidity and provide easy access for investors. The 30-day overallotment option granted to underwriters is a common practice known as a 'greenshoe' option, which provides stability and liquidity to the notes' market post-issuance. This could help in maintaining the notes' price close to the offering price, thereby potentially reducing volatility shortly after the listing.It is also important to consider the competitive landscape and the current economic environment. The choice of joint book-running managers—Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Morgan Stanley and RBC Capital Markets—brings credibility to the offering, as these institutions are well-regarded in the financial industry. Their involvement may reassure investors of the offering's legitimacy and could aid in achieving a successful capital raise. Debt Capital Markets Expert Trinity Capital Inc.'s underwritten public offering of notes is a clear indication of tapping into the debt capital markets to optimize its capital structure. The offered yield of 7.875% is relatively high, which could be reflective of the current interest rate environment or specific credit risk associated with Trinity. For investors, the yield represents the compensation for the credit risk they are taking on and it is essential to compare this with the yields of similar instruments in the market to assess its attractiveness.The use of proceeds to pay down existing debt is a prudent measure, especially if the new debt has a lower cost or more favorable terms. However, investors should scrutinize Trinity's overall debt maturity profile and how this new offering fits within it. The redemption feature provides the company with an exit strategy for the notes, which will have implications for the company's interest expense and cash flow management in the mid to long term. 03/25/2024 - 05:59 PM PHOENIX, March 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Trinity Capital Inc.

(LUCD) reports a 33% sequential increase in Quarterly EsoGuard® revenue. The company is focused on expanding clinical validity and utility data to drive medical policy coverage, including potential Medicare coverage. Lucid's recent business update highlights revenue growth, stable test volume, improving revenue cycle management, and progress in engaging with major commercial payors for positive coverage. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Lucid Diagnostics Inc. regarding a 33 percent sequential increase in quarterly EsoGuard revenue is a strong indicator of the company's growth trajectory in the medical diagnostics sector. This performance metric is particularly significant as it reflects not only an increase in sales but also potential improvements in market penetration and adoption of the EsoGuard test, which is designed for the early detection of esophageal cancer.Furthermore, the mention of expanding clinical validity and utility data that could drive medical policy coverage, including Medicare, suggests that Lucid is positioning itself to capitalize on a broader market. The ability to secure Medicare coverage could substantially increase the addressable market for EsoGuard, as Medicare beneficiaries represent a large segment of the population at risk for esophageal cancer. The engagement with medical directors at major commercial payors for positive coverage is another pivotal step that could lead to increased utilization and reimbursement rates.Investors should note that stable test volume and improving revenue cycle management processes, yielding better allowances and stable pricing, are indicative of a maturing operation with potential for enhanced margins. Lucid's #CYFT program and high-volume testing events could further bolster revenue streams and diversify the company's portfolio of services. However, investors should also consider the inherent risks associated with the healthcare industry, such as regulatory changes and competitive pressures, when evaluating the company's long-term prospects. Medical Research Analyst The emphasis on clinical validity and clinical utility evidence is paramount for the adoption of any new medical diagnostic tool. Lucid's strategic focus on building a robust evidence base for EsoGuard is a critical step toward establishing the test as a standard of care for esophageal cancer screening. The potential line of sight to Medicare coverage is particularly noteworthy as it implies that the company has amassed sufficient data to demonstrate the test's efficacy and cost-effectiveness to Medicare's medical directors.From a research perspective, Lucid's engagement with commercial payors to request positive coverage is an essential process that involves demonstrating the test's ability to improve patient outcomes and potentially reduce overall healthcare costs by catching cancer earlier. The success of these engagements could lead to increased adoption of the test by healthcare providers, which in turn could have a positive impact on public health outcomes. Moreover, the company's direct contracting initiative, which is gaining momentum, could provide more control over pricing and distribution, potentially leading to increased market share.It is important for stakeholders to monitor the ongoing accumulation of clinical evidence supporting EsoGuard, as well as the outcomes of discussions with payors, as these factors will significantly influence the test's adoption rate and, consequently, Lucid's financial performance. Additionally, the company's ability to navigate the complex landscape of healthcare reimbursement will be a determining factor in its success. 03/25/2024 - 05:30 PM Quarterly EsoGuard® revenue increased 33 percent sequentially Expanding EsoGuard clinical validity and clinical utility data poised to drive medical policy coverage, including line of sight to Medicare coverage Conference call and webcast to be held tomorrow, March 26th at 8:30 AM ET NEW YORK, March 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Lucid Diagnostics Inc. (Nasdaq: LUCD) (""Lucid"" or the ""Company"") a commercial-stage, cancer prevention medical diagnostics company, and majority-owned subsidiary of PAVmed Inc. (Nasdaq: PAVM, PAVMZ) ( ""PAVmed""), today provided a business update for the Company and presented financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Business Update Highlights ""We are very pleased with the excellent progress Lucid has made on multiple fronts in the fourth quarter and recent weeks,"" said Lishan Aklog, M.D., Lucid's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""We saw solid revenue growth on stable test volume and our revenue cycle management processes are yielding improving allowances and stable pricing. Our #CYFT program targeting firefighters and other groups is thriving and we have a robust pipeline of scheduled high-volume testing events. Most importantly, we have rapidly built our clinical validity and clinical utility evidence base to drive positive medical policy coverage, including what now we believe is line of sight to Medicare coverage. Equipped with sufficient data, we have for the first time engaged with medical directors at major commercial payors to request positive coverage. Our direct contracting initiative is also accelerating and we are excited about the near-term prospects of delivering contracts, testing and revenue."" Highlights from the fourth quarter and recent weeks include: 4Q23 EsoGuard revenue was $1.04M, which represents a 33 percent increase sequentially from 3Q23 and an 829 percent annual increase from 4Q22.Lucid's CLIA-certified clinical laboratory performed 2,201 commercial EsoGuard® Esophageal DNA Tests in 4Q23.High-volume #CYFT health fair testing events continue to gain traction with a robust roster of events scheduled through July.Lucid initiated EsoGuard testing at over a dozen strategic accounts at health systems and academic medical centers with several dozen more engagements in process.Since upgrading to a new revenue cycle management provider in mid-June, Lucid has submitted claims to commercial and governmental payors representing approximately $20 million in pro forma revenue. The vast majority of these claims have been adjudicated with nearly half resulting in an allowable amount of approximately $1,800 per test, on average.EsoGuard's clinical validity and clinical utility data evidence base has expanded significantly in the fourth quarter and recent months. Lucid now has publicly-released data from three clinical validity studies demonstrating excellent EsoGuard sensitivity and negative predictive value, including unprecedented performance of a molecular diagnostic test in detecting precancer. In addition, three published clinical utility studies have documented near-perfect concordance between EsoGuard results and physician referral for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. These data provide a strong foundation of critical evidence needed to support broad EsoGuard medical policy coverage. Lucid expects to leverage this data in its upcoming re-engagement with the MolDX program to secure Medicare coverage under the final and effective foundational Local Coverage Determination.Held several meetings in recent months with medical directors of major commercial payors to discuss clinical validity and utility data and formally request positive medical policy determinations for EsoGuard. The Company also participated in a Blue Cross Blue Shield Association of America webinar with dozens of medical directors in attendance, during which Nicholas Shaheen, M.D., M.P.H., a leading esophageal precancer expert and lead author of the American College of Gastroenterology's guidelines, advocated for coverage of non-endoscopic biomarker testing consistent with the ACG guidelines. Lucid also expects recent expansion of legislation requiring coverage of certain biomarker tests, now effective in fourteen states, will help drive medical policy coverage.Established that EsoGuard testing can be offered as a covered benefit within health and wellness programs as a means to drive contractually-guaranteed revenues. Lucid has built a robust pipeline of direct contracting counterparties, including benefits brokers, third-party administrators, and self-insured entities. The Company expects to drive direct contract testing events with meaningful revenues in the coming quarters. The Company is adding resources to the direct contracting team to accelerate this initiativeFinancial Results For the three months ended December 31, 2023, EsoGuard related revenues were $1.0 million, while for the year ended December 31, 2023, revenues were $2.4 million. Fourth quarter and full year 2023 operating expenses were approximately $12.5 million and $50.9 million, respectively, including stock-based compensation expenses of $1.0 million and $6.8 million, respectively.

Over 80 percent of EAC patients die within five years of diagnosis, making it the second most lethal cancer in the U.S. The mortality rate is high even in those diagnosed with early stage EAC. The U.S. incidence of EAC has increased 500 percent over the past four decades, while the incidences of other common cancers have declined or remained flat. In nearly all cases, EAC silently progresses until it manifests itself with new symptoms of advanced disease. All EAC is believed to arise from esophageal precancer, which occurs in approximately 5 percent to 15 percent of at-risk GERD patients. Early esophageal precancer can be monitored for progression to late esophageal precancer which can be cured with endoscopic esophageal ablation, reliably halting progression to cancer. Esophageal precancer screening is already recommended by clinical practice guidelines in millions of GERD patients with multiple risk factors, including age over 50 years, male gender, White race, obesity, smoking history, and a family history of esophageal precancer or cancer. Unfortunately, fewer than 10 percent of those recommended for screening undergo traditional invasive endoscopic screening. The profound tragedy of an EAC diagnosis is that likely death could have been prevented if the at-risk GERD patient had been screened and then undergone surveillance and curative treatment. The only missing element for a viable esophageal cancer prevention program has been the lack of a widespread screening tool that can detect esophageal precancer. Lucid believes EsoGuard, performed on samples collected with EsoCheck, is the missing element – the first and only commercially available test capable of serving as a widespread screening tool to prevent esophageal cancer deaths through the early detection of esophageal precancer in at-risk GERD patients. An updated American College of Gastroenterology clinical practice guideline and an American Gastroenterological Association clinical practice update both endorse non-endoscopic biomarker tests as an acceptable alternative to costly and invasive endoscopy for esophageal precancer screening. EsoGuard is the only such test currently available in the United States. EsoGuard is a bisulfite-converted NGS DNA assay performed on surface esophageal cells collected with EsoCheck, which quantifies methylation at 31 sites on two genes, Vimentin (VIM) and Cyclin A1 (CCNA1). The assay was evaluated in a 408-patient, multicenter, case-control study published in Science Translational Medicine and showed greater than 90 percent sensitivity and specificity at detecting esophageal precancer and cancer. EsoCheck is an FDA 510(k) and CE Mark cleared noninvasive swallowable balloon capsule catheter device capable of sampling surface esophageal cells in a less than five-minute office procedure. It consists of a vitamin pill-sized rigid plastic capsule tethered to a thin silicone catheter from which a soft silicone balloon with textured ridges emerges to gently swab surface esophageal cells. When vacuum suction is applied, the balloon and sampled cells are pulled into the capsule, protecting them from contamination and dilution by cells outside of the targeted region during device withdrawal. Lucid believes this proprietary Collect+Protect™ technology makes EsoCheck the only noninvasive esophageal cell collection device capable of such anatomically targeted and protected sampling. The sample is sent by overnight express mail to Lucid's CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited laboratory, LucidDx Labs, for EsoGuard testing. About Lucid DiagnosticsLucid Diagnostics Inc. is a commercial-stage medical diagnostics company focused on cancer prevention, and subsidiary of PAVmed Inc. (Nasdaq: PAVM). Lucid is focused on the millions of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), also known as chronic heartburn, who are at risk of developing esophageal precancer and cancer. Lucid's EsoGuard® Esophageal DNA Test, performed on samples collected in a brief, noninvasive office procedure with its EsoCheck Esophageal Cell Collection Device, is the first and only commercially available diagnostic test capable of serving as a widespread screening tool for at-risk patients to mitigate the risks of cancer and cancer deaths through early detection of esophageal precancer.

Interest expense increased due to rising debt and interest rates. Net loss attributable to Ampco-Pittsburgh for Q4 2023 was $41.8 million. Financial Analyst The reported increase in quarterly and annual sales for Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation, particularly in the Air and Liquid Processing segment, reflects a robust demand for the company's products, likely driven by industry growth or market share gains. Such sales growth can be a positive signal to investors about the company's revenue-generating capabilities. However, the significant loss from operations due to the asbestos-related revaluation charge is a substantial concern. This non-cash charge, while not affecting cash flow directly, represents a material impact on the company's profitability and could potentially influence investor sentiment and the stock's valuation.Moreover, the conclusion of the U.S. forged business equipment modernization program suggests potential future improvements in operational efficiency and cost management. While this may not have immediate financial benefits, it could improve long-term profitability and competitive positioning. The increased interest expense, due to higher debt and interest rates, is another critical factor that could pressure the company's financials in the short term. Investors should carefully consider the balance between these growth prospects and the financial challenges presented. Market Research Analyst The reported sales growth in the Air and Liquid Processing segment indicates that Ampco-Pittsburgh is effectively capitalizing on market opportunities in this area. This could be due to innovation, an expanded product line, or strategic partnerships. However, the decline in FEP product demand and softer demand for cast rolls suggests that the company may need to adjust its strategy to address shifting market dynamics. The mention of high energy costs in the European cast roll business highlights the impact of geopolitical events, like the Russia-Ukraine conflict, on global supply chains and operational costs.Investors may find the company's ability to navigate these challenges, coupled with strategic initiatives such as the equipment modernization program, indicative of management's adaptability and long-term vision. A critical observation is the company's positioning to selectively capture market opportunities post-modernization, which could lead to an improved market share and stronger financial performance in the future. Legal Expert The asbestos-related charge is a significant legal and financial issue that has affected Ampco-Pittsburgh's operational results. The revaluation reflects a trend toward higher expected settlement values and indicates that the company is adjusting its liabilities in line with recent claims experience. This adjustment is a prudent legal move, ensuring that the company's financial statements accurately reflect potential future liabilities. However, it also underscores the ongoing risks associated with legacy asbestos exposure, which can lead to substantial financial impacts and potential reputational harm.Investors should be aware that such legal contingencies can recur and may require careful monitoring of the company's legal provisions and risk management strategies. The impact of these legal issues on the company's financial health is a critical factor for stakeholders to consider, alongside the operational performance of the business segments. 03/25/2024 - 04:32 PM Q4 2023 sales up 16% over Q4 2022; full year 2023 sales up 8% over full year 2022. Air and Liquid Processing segment sales increased 35% for Q4 2023 and 31% for 2023 YTD compared to prior year periods. 2023 full year loss from operations of $34.6 million includes a $40.9 million non-cash, undiscounted asbestos-related revaluation charge recorded in Q4 2023. 2023 full year non-GAAP adjusted income from operations improved $4.5 million vs 2022. Conclusion of U.S. forged business equipment modernization program in Q1 2024. CARNEGIE, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation (NYSE: AP) reported net sales of $108.1 million and $422.3 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $93.5 million and $390.2 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. The increase for both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, over the prior year periods was primarily driven by record Air and Liquid segment sales, higher forged roll shipment volumes, and higher net roll pricing, offset in part by lower shipments of forged engineered products. The Corporation reported a loss from operations for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, of $41.6 million and $34.6 million, respectively, compared to income from operations for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, of $0.9 million and $2.8 million, respectively. The three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2023, include an asbestos-related charge resulting from the net effect of the revaluation of asbestos liabilities and the related insurance receivables (the “Asbestos-Related Charge”) of $40.9 million. This revaluation reflects more recent claims experience, indicating primarily a trend toward higher expected settlement values for pending and future asbestos claims. By comparison, the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2022, include an asbestos-related benefit of $2.2 million resulting from a reduction in the estimated long-term defense cost portion of the Corporation’s asbestos liability (the “Asbestos-Related Credit”). Both the Asbestos-Related Charge and the Asbestos-Related Credit are recorded in the Air and Liquid Processing segment’s operating results for the applicable periods. CEO Brett McBrayer commented, “Our non-GAAP adjusted operating income improved by $4.5 million in 2023 over 2022, each of which exclude the impact of the non-cash and undiscounted Asbestos-Related Charge (Credit) and other unusual items. Record sales in Air and Liquid Processing, and the positive impacts of higher forged roll volumes and higher net pricing in our roll business collectively overcame a significant market decline in FEP product demand and softer demand for cast rolls. Although our U.S. forged roll business performed well, excess plant capacity for current demand levels coupled with high energy costs in our European cast roll business continued to weigh heavily on our results in 2023. With the conclusion of the equipment revitalization effort in our U.S. forged business in Q1 2024 and some relief with lower energy prices in Europe, we are better positioned to selectively capture market opportunities.” Interest expense for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, increased due to a rise in total debt and interest rates for the current year periods when compared to the same periods of the prior year. “Other – net” improved for the three months ended December 31, 2023, when compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses, partly offset by lower pension income; however, “Other – net” declined for the full year primarily due to fluctuations in foreign exchange and lower pension income, partly offset by unrealized gains in Rabbi Trust investments compared to prior year unrealized losses. The income tax provision for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, includes a $1.3 million income tax benefit related to the Asbestos-Related Charge. The income tax provision for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, also includes the recognition of a $0.3 million valuation allowance against the net deferred income tax assets of the Corporation’s U.K. operations, which entered into a three-year cumulative loss position during the quarter, given the higher energy costs it experienced in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the resulting shift in the majority of its production load to another facility. Net loss attributable to Ampco-Pittsburgh for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, was $41.8 million, or $2.12 per share, and $39.9 million, or $2.04 per share, respectively, which include approximately $2.00 per share and $2.02 per share, respectively, for the after-tax impact of the Asbestos-Related Charge. This compares to net loss attributable to Ampco-Pittsburgh for the three months ended December 31, 2022, of $0.5 million, or $0.02 per share, and net income attributable to Ampco-Pittsburgh for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, of $3.4 million, or $0.18 per share. Segment Results Forged and Cast Engineered Products Segment sales for the three months ended December 31, 2023, increased 9% compared to the prior year period primarily due to a higher volume of mill roll shipments and improved pricing. Sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, were comparable to the prior year period, as higher forged roll shipment volumes and improved roll pricing approximately offset a decline in shipments of forged engineered products and cast rolls. Segment operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2023, improved compared to the prior year primarily due to higher shipment volumes. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, segment operating results improved primarily due to higher net pricing, improved product sales mix and the benefit from a foreign energy credit, which more than offset lower manufacturing cost absorption due to the temporary idling of capacity to align production with demand, and higher selling and administrative costs. The segment’s prior full year selling and administrative costs were lower in part due to the impact of a change in an employee benefit policy, which reduced expense in 2022. Air and Liquid Processing Sales for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, improved when compared to the prior year periods by 35% and 31%, respectively, due to a higher volume of shipments of heat exchange coils, custom air handlers and centrifugal pumps. Segment operating results declined for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the Asbestos-Related Charge in the current year periods and the absence of the Asbestos-Related Credit from the prior-year periods. Business unit operations improved due to the higher volume of shipments, offset in part by higher operating costs, including those associated with the segment’s commercial growth and plant expansions, as well as an unfavorable product mix effect.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The Corporation presents non-GAAP adjusted income (loss) from operations, which is calculated as (loss) income from operations excluding the Asbestos-Related Charge (Credit), the Asbestos-Related Proceeds, the Foreign Energy Credit, the Change in Employee Benefit Policy, and the Refund of Excess COVID-19 Subsidies, for each of the years, as applicable. This non-GAAP financial measure is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. The Corporation has presented non-GAAP adjusted income (loss) from operations because it is a key measure used by the Corporation’s management and Board of Directors to understand and evaluate the Corporation’s operating performance and to develop operational goals for managing its business. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes significant charges or credits that are one-time charges or credits, or unrelated to the Corporation’s ongoing results of operations, or beyond its control. Additionally, a portion of the incentive and compensation arrangements for certain employees is based on the Corporation’s business performance. The Corporation believes this non-GAAP financial measure helps identify underlying trends in its business that otherwise could be masked by the effect of the items it excludes from adjusted income (loss) from operations. In particular, the Corporation believes the exclusion of the Asbestos-Related Charge (Credit), the Asbestos-Related Proceeds, the Foreign Energy Credit, the Change in Employee Benefit Policy, and the Refund of Excess COVID-19 Subsidies, can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of the Corporation’s core business performance. The Corporation also believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to management, shareholders and investors, and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by the Corporation’s management in its financial and operational decision-making. Adjusted (loss) income from operations is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations related to the use of adjusted (loss) income from operations rather than (loss) income from operations, which is the nearest GAAP equivalent. Among other things, there can be no assurance that additional benefits similar to the Asbestos-Related Credit, the Asbestos-Related Proceeds, the Foreign Energy Credit and the Change in Employee Benefit Policy or additional expenses similar to the Asbestos-Related Charge and the Refund of Excess COVID-19 Subsidies will not occur in future periods. The adjustments reflected in adjusted (loss) income from operations are pre-tax.

(ELDN) announced the enrollment of the 12th participant in the Phase 2 BESTOW trial comparing tegoprubart with tacrolimus for kidney transplant rejection prevention. The trial progress indicates a demand for new immunosuppressive options due to the risks associated with current therapies. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Analyst The enrollment progression in Eledon's Phase 2 BESTOW trial is indicative of the company's operational efficiency and the potential market demand for an alternative to current immunosuppressive therapies. The focus on tegoprubart suggests a strategic move to address the long-term complications associated with calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), such as nephrotoxicity and diabetes. As a pharmaceutical analyst, one would scrutinize the trial's design and enrollment rate, which can be a proxy for future success. A faster-than-expected enrollment could signal a high interest level within the medical community and among patients, possibly translating into a competitive advantage if the drug's efficacy and safety profiles are proven.Investors should monitor the trial's progress closely, as positive outcomes could lead to significant market share in the transplantation medication sector. However, the inherent risks of clinical trials, such as potential safety issues or lack of efficacy, could impact the company's financial projections and stock performance. Moreover, the ability of tegoprubart to meet the unmet needs in organ transplantation without the side effects of CNIs could disrupt the current standard of care, potentially leading to a revaluation of Eledon's market capitalization. Medical Research Analyst From a medical research perspective, the BESTOW trial's head-to-head comparison of tegoprubart with tacrolimus is a significant undertaking. It is essential to explore alternatives that could mitigate the adverse effects of CNIs. The medical community is well aware of the balance that must be struck between immunosuppression and toxicity. A successful trial could lead to a paradigm shift in post-transplant care, emphasizing the importance of long-term graft survival without compromising patient quality of life.Long-term graft survival is a critical measure of success in kidney transplantation. The statistic indicating that 30-50% of kidney transplants fail within 10-15 years due to CNI toxicity underscores the importance of this research. If tegoprubart can demonstrate a reduction in nephrotoxicity while maintaining or improving rejection rates, it could become a new standard of care. This would have profound implications not only for patients' health outcomes but also for healthcare costs associated with long-term complications and subsequent treatments. Healthcare Economist From an economic standpoint, the development of a novel immunosuppressive agent like tegoprubart has the potential to reduce the long-term healthcare costs associated with kidney transplantation. The direct costs of managing CNI-related complications are substantial, not to mention the indirect costs such as loss of productivity and quality of life for patients. Thus, an alternative that can decrease these complications could offer significant savings to healthcare systems and insurers.Furthermore, the successful commercialization of tegoprubart could lead to increased valuation of Eledon Pharmaceuticals in the biotech sector. Investors and healthcare economists would be interested in the drug's pricing strategy, market penetration potential and the long-term impact on the company's revenue streams. The drug's adoption rate will also be influenced by how well it is received by the transplantation community, payer coverage and the outcomes of subsequent Phase 3 trials, assuming Phase 2 results are positive. 03/25/2024 - 04:56 PM IRVINE, Calif., March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eledon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Eledon”) (NASDAQ: ELDN) today announced the enrollment of the 12th participant on March 23, 2024, in the Company’s ongoing Phase 2 BESTOW trial assessing tegoprubart head-to-head with tacrolimus for the prevention of rejection in kidney transplantation. “We are pleased with the strong pace of enrollment in our Phase 2 BESTOW trial and believe it speaks to the underlying demand for a new immunosuppressive regimen for the tens of thousands of patients each year who undergo kidney transplantation,” said David-Alexandre C. Gros, M.D., Chief Executive Officer. The Risk of Organ Failure in Transplantation In transplantation procedures, organ rejection is a major cause of graft failure, which can be a life-threatening condition. Rejection occurs due to allorecognition, wherein the recipient's immune system identifies the transplanted organ as foreign tissue, triggering an immune response against the transplanted organ. To reduce the risk of rejection, patients are treated with immunosuppressive therapies for life. Calcineurin inhibitors (“CNIs”) are a critical component of most immunosuppressive regimens to prevent acute and long-term organ transplant rejection. However, chronic exposure to CNIs (tacrolimus is the drug most commonly used) is associated with nephrotoxicity, hypertension, new onset diabetes due to pancreatic beta cell toxicity, as well as central nervous system side effects like tremor. Regarding kidney transplantation, the toxicity associated with CNIs causes 30-50% of kidney transplants to fail with 10-15 years of transplantation. Strategies to better and more safely protect transplanted organs and thus increase how long they function represent a significant area of unmet need in organ transplantation. About Eledon Pharmaceuticals and tegoprubart Eledon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical stage biotechnology company that is developing immune-modulating therapies for the management and treatment of life-threatening conditions. The Company’s lead investigational product is tegoprubart, an anti-CD40L antibody with high affinity for the CD40 Ligand, a well-validated biological target that has broad therapeutic potential. The central role of CD40L signaling in both adaptive and innate immune cell activation and function positions it as an attractive target for non-lymphocyte depleting, immunomodulatory therapeutic intervention. The Company is building upon a deep historical knowledge of anti-CD40 Ligand biology to conduct preclinical and clinical studies in kidney allograft transplantation, xenotransplantation, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Eledon is headquartered in Irvine, California. For more information, please visit the Company’s website at www.eledon.com.

""These retirements improve our overall capital structure, directly enable lower annual interest costs and reinforce our ability to pursue ongoing opportunities to lower our cost of borrowing and drive future profitability."" Pursuant to the repurchase agreement, as of March 29, 2024, the Company will have paid approximately $60.0 million in cash plus certain customary fees and expenses and accrued and unpaid interest to repurchase from the Holders approximately $78.0 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes, a 23.0% discount to par value.

the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the repurchase agreements by the Holders; our reliance on a small number of significant customers; continued vertical integration by our customers; global shifts in sourcing customer requirements; shifts in the global supply and demand position for tobacco products; variation in our financial results due to growing conditions, customer indications and other factors; loss of confidence in us by our customers, farmers and other suppliers; migration of suppliers who have historically grown tobacco and from whom we have purchased tobacco toward growing other crops; risks related to our advancement of inputs to tobacco suppliers to be settled upon the suppliers delivering us unprocessed tobacco at the end of the growing season;

J.P. Morgan and BofA Securities are the underwriters for the offering. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The public offering of 5,250,000 shares by Matador Resources Company represents a strategic move to strengthen the company's financial position. The decision to allocate net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and debt repayment, suggests a proactive approach to managing the balance sheet. This can be seen as an effort to optimize capital structure and liquidity, which is essential for maintaining operational flexibility. Investors often look favorably upon such uses of capital as they can lead to improved financial metrics and potential growth opportunities.However, the dilutive effect of the new share issuance on existing shareholders cannot be overlooked. The immediate impact may include a decrease in earnings per share and potential short-term downward pressure on the stock price. Long-term effects will depend on the efficiency and return on investment of the allocated funds. If Matador can deploy the capital towards high-return projects or acquisitions that complement its core business, the initial dilution might be offset by future earnings growth. Market Research Analyst The role of underwriters J.P. Morgan and BofA Securities in Matador's public offering is noteworthy. Their involvement adds credibility to the process and may help in achieving a favorable price for the shares. The flexibility in sales strategy—ranging from transactions on the NYSE to over-the-counter deals—allows for adaptation to market conditions, potentially maximizing proceeds. Investors should monitor the execution of the offering for insights into market demand and the perceived value of Matador's stock.From a market perspective, the energy sector, where Matador operates, is subject to volatility due to fluctuating commodity prices and regulatory changes. The company's financial agility, post-offering, will be critical in navigating these uncertainties. A successful offering could signal market confidence and attract further investment, while a tepid response might raise concerns about the company's valuation or strategic direction. Legal Expert It is important to recognize the legal framework governing this public offering. Matador's use of an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, as per the SEC, allows for a streamlined process and quicker access to the capital markets. This regulatory tool is beneficial for companies that meet certain criteria, offering them flexibility to time the market and respond to funding needs efficiently.Prospective investors should understand that the prospectus and related prospectus supplement are legal documents outlining the terms of the offering and risks involved. These documents are critical for performing due diligence. It's also worth noting that the offering is subject to the Securities Act of 1933, ensuring transparency and protection for investors. Compliance with these regulations is important to prevent legal repercussions and maintain investor trust. 03/25/2024 - 04:37 PM DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Matador Resources Company (NYSE: MTDR) (“Matador”) announced today that it has commenced an underwritten public offering of 5,250,000 shares of its common stock.

MDU Resources Files Confidential Form 10 for Planned Late 2024 Spinoff of Construction Services Business,2024-03-25T20:30:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"MDU Resources Group, Inc. plans to spin off its construction services business, Everus Construction Group, with a confidential draft registration statement submitted to the SEC.

The spinoff is expected to be completed in Q4 2024, allowing MDU Resources to focus on its regulated energy delivery business. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The submission of a confidential draft registration statement on Form 10 for the spinoff of Everus Construction Group by MDU Resources Group signifies a strategic restructuring of the company. The separation of the construction services business allows MDU Resources to streamline its focus on regulated energy delivery, which could lead to improved operational efficiencies and potentially enhance investor appeal for a more focused business model. The market typically responds to such spinoffs with a keen interest in the newly created entity's growth prospects and the parent company's revised strategic direction.From a financial perspective, the spinoff could result in a more transparent valuation for both MDU Resources and Everus Construction Group as separate entities. This clarity may attract investors who prefer pure-play companies with a clear-cut business focus. Additionally, the separation could unlock value by allowing each company to pursue more targeted capital allocation strategies and growth opportunities within their respective markets. However, investors should be aware of the costs associated with the spinoff, such as transaction and restructuring expenses and how these might impact short-term financials. Market Research Analyst Examining the industry context, the spinoff of Everus Construction Group aligns with a broader trend where conglomerates are simplifying their business structures to sharpen strategic focus. For stakeholders, the critical aspect to monitor will be the market's reception of Everus as an independent entity. This includes evaluating the construction industry's current market conditions, competitive landscape and Everus's positioning within that space. Furthermore, the timing of the spinoff, expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024, could coincide with cyclic changes in the construction sector, which may influence Everus's initial performance as a standalone company.For MDU Resources, the refocus on regulated energy delivery could provide a more predictable revenue stream and potentially reduce exposure to the cyclical nature of the construction industry. However, this benefit must be weighed against the loss of revenue diversification that the construction services business provided. The market will likely scrutinize the post-spinoff performance metrics and growth strategies of both entities to assess the long-term value proposition of the spinoff. Legal Expert The filing of a Form 10 is a legal process that involves a thorough review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), ensuring that all necessary disclosures are made for the benefit of current and potential investors. This step is essential in protecting shareholder interests and maintaining market integrity. The legal intricacies of the spinoff process, including regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other conditions, are pivotal in determining the final timeline and success of the transaction.Investors should be cognizant of the legal ramifications of the spinoff, including potential risks related to the separation agreements, transfer of liabilities and contractual obligations that Everus Construction Group will inherit as an independent company. The final approval by MDU Resources' board of directors will be based on a comprehensive evaluation of these factors and their decision will be instrumental in ensuring that the spinoff aligns with the long-term strategic objectives and legal compliance requirements. 03/25/2024 - 04:30 PM BISMARCK, N.D., March 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- MDU Resources Group, Inc. (NYSE: MDU) announced today that it has submitted a confidential draft registration statement on Form 10 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the planned spinoff of its construction services business, Everus Construction Group. MDU Resources expects the spinoff of Everus Construction Group to be complete in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to final approval by MDU Resources' board of directors. MDU Resources announced on March 13 that its construction services business, MDU Construction Services Group, had been rebranded as Everus Construction Group. ""When the spinoff of the construction services business is complete late this year, MDU Resources will be a pure-play regulated energy delivery business,"" said Nicole A. Kivisto, president and CEO of MDU Resources. ""This will allow MDU Resources and Everus each to focus on our individual business growth opportunities, which will allow us to continue to maximize value for shareholders."" MDU Resources had announced Nov. 2, 2023, that it intends to separate its construction services business as an independent, publicly traded company.

The transaction marks a significant financial milestone for FirstEnergy, enhancing its growth prospects and capitalizing on strategic equity financings. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The sale of an additional 30% stake in FirstEnergy Transmission, LLC to Brookfield represents a significant capital infusion for FirstEnergy Corp., enhancing its liquidity and reducing leverage. The proceeds of $3.5 billion, with $2.3 billion in cash and $1.2 billion in notes, are substantial for FirstEnergy's balance sheet. The valuation at 36x trailing 12-month price-to-earnings is notably higher than the average for utility companies, which typically trade around 20x P/E. This premium could reflect the strategic importance of FET's assets or expectations of higher growth or profitability.Investors should note that the completion of $7 billion in equity financings since late 2021 at an equivalent share price of $87 indicates a proactive approach to capital management. The transaction's impact on FirstEnergy's stock could be positive, as it signals confidence from a reputable infrastructure investment firm and provides financial flexibility for the Energize365 grid investment program, which is a significant commitment to infrastructure improvements over five years. Energy Sector Analyst FirstEnergy's Energize365 grid investment program aligns with broader industry trends towards grid modernization and resilience. The infrastructure improvements are critical in adapting to increased renewable energy integration and the electrification of the economy. The strategic partnership with Brookfield, a firm known for long-term infrastructure investments, suggests a shared vision for the future of energy, focusing on decarbonization and stable long-term cash flows.The scale of the investment, $26 billion over five years, is ambitious and indicates FirstEnergy's commitment to maintaining and enhancing its operational excellence, reliability and safety. This level of investment could set a precedent within the utility sector and may influence how other companies approach grid modernization and capital allocation. Stakeholders should monitor the execution of the Energize365 program, as its success could impact FirstEnergy's operational efficiency and customer satisfaction in the long term. Market Research Analyst Brookfield's follow-on investment in FirstEnergy's transmission subsidiary is a strategic move that reflects confidence in the utility sector's stability and growth potential. The transaction provides FirstEnergy with the means to fund its ambitious Energize365 program, which could enhance the company's competitiveness in the industry. By focusing on grid investment, FirstEnergy is positioning itself to meet future energy demands and regulatory requirements, potentially leading to increased market share and customer loyalty.From a market perspective, the partnership with Brookfield could be perceived as a positive indicator by investors, as it provides a vote of confidence in FirstEnergy's long-term strategy and financial health. The emphasis on decarbonization and electrification within the investment rationale aligns with global trends and investor interests in sustainable and socially responsible investments. The impact on FirstEnergy's stock will depend on the company's ability to effectively deploy the capital towards its stated goals and demonstrate progress in its grid investment initiatives. 03/25/2024 - 04:20 PM Follow-on investment by Brookfield Super-Core Infrastructure Partners strengthens FirstEnergy's balance sheet, supports sustainable, long-term growth through industry-leading Energize365 grid investment program AKRON, Ohio, March 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- FirstEnergy Corp.

The company received a staff determination letter from Nasdaq, notifying them of the impending delisting unless an appeal is requested. GSUN has not met the $1.00 per share bid price requirement and is exploring options like a reverse stock split. Positive None. Negative Potential delisting from Nasdaq due to non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement Company's failure to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement poses a significant risk Shareholders may face uncertainty and potential losses if delisting occurs Market Analyst The notice of delisting received by Golden Sun Health Technology Group Limited represents a significant red flag for investors and indicates a pressing need for the company to address its stock price issues. The failure to meet the Nasdaq's Minimum Bid Requirement suggests that the market has devalued the company's stock, possibly due to underlying financial weaknesses or investor skepticism about the company's future performance.From a market perspective, this situation puts Golden Sun in a precarious position. The potential delisting could lead to reduced liquidity and investor confidence, making it more difficult for the company to raise capital. Delisting also often results in a shift of investor focus towards more stable investment opportunities. For current shareholders, this development could mean a substantial decrease in the value of their investment.The consideration of a reverse stock split is a common strategy to boost the share price to meet exchange requirements. However, this is often viewed as a cosmetic fix rather than a solution to fundamental business challenges. Investors typically prefer operational improvements and strategic initiatives that drive organic growth and profitability over artificial share price inflations. Financial Analyst Golden Sun's non-compliance with Nasdaq's Minimum Bid Requirement points to a deeper financial concern, particularly the reference to not meeting the initial listing requirement of $5,000,000 minimum stockholders’ equity. This metric is often considered a barometer of a company's financial health and its ability to sustain operations. A shortfall here could indicate that Golden Sun has been eroding its equity base, which can be a result of sustained losses or write-downs.Investors should be aware that the appeal process and any subsequent actions such as a reverse stock split do not address the fundamental issues that may be causing the stock's underperformance. They should look for detailed plans on how the company intends to improve its financial health and whether it has a viable path to profitability.It is also important to monitor the company's updates closely. Material updates can provide insights into management's strategy and the likelihood of regaining compliance with Nasdaq's requirements. The lack of a second 180-day compliance period underscores the urgency for the company to act and could be indicative of the exchange's assessment of the company's ability to remedy its financial situation. Legal Expert In terms of regulatory implications, Golden Sun's receipt of a delisting notification from Nasdaq triggers a series of procedural steps that the company must navigate carefully. Requesting an appeal to the Hearings Panel is a critical legal right that the company has exercised to prevent immediate delisting. The legal process involves presenting a plan to the Panel that outlines how the company will regain compliance.Investors should understand that while the hearing request stays the suspension temporarily, it is not a guarantee of the company's future on the exchange. The Panel's decision will ultimately hinge on Golden Sun's ability to present a convincing plan that addresses the exchange's concerns. Furthermore, the filing of Form 25-NSE with the SEC is a formal step towards delisting, which underscores the seriousness of the situation and the potential impact on the company's trading status.The legal route offers a company under threat of delisting a chance to rectify its position, but it also adds a layer of uncertainty for investors. The outcomes of such hearings can be unpredictable and the time frames for resolution can vary, affecting the stock's performance in the interim. 03/25/2024 - 04:05 PM Shanghai, China, March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Golden Sun Health Technology Group Limited, formerly known as Golden Sun Education Group Limited (the “Company” or “Golden Sun”) (Nasdaq: GSUN), a provider of tutorial services in China, today announced the Company received a staff determination letter (the “Letter”), on March 21, 2024, from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that, due to the Company's failure to regain compliance with a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the ""Minimum Bid Requirement""), the Staff has determined (the “Determination”) that Company's securities will be scheduled for delisting from Nasdaq unless the Company requests an appeal of this determination to a Hearings Panel (the ""Panel""). On September 22, 2023, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq (the ""Notice""), notifying the Company that based upon the closing bid price of its Class A ordinary shares for the last 30 consecutive business days preceding the Notice, the Company was not in compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement. In accordance with Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Notice provided the Company a period of 180 calendar days from the date of the Notice, or until March 20, 2024, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement. According to the Letter, the Company had not regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement as of March 20, 2024 and is not eligible for a second 180-day period. Specifically, the Company does not comply with the initial listing requirement of $5,000,000 minimum stockholders’ equity for The Nasdaq Capital Market, as contemplated for a second 180-day period. Unless the Company requests an appeal of the Determination by March 28, 2024, the Company’s Class A ordinary shares will be suspended at the opening of business on April 2, 2024, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will remove the Company’s Class A ordinary shares from listing and registration on Nasdaq. The Company plans to appeal the Determination to the Panel in due course. A hearing request will stay the suspension of the Company’s securities and the filing of Form 25-NSE pending the Panel’s decision. The Company is considering all options available to it, including a reverse stock split, and will provide its shareholders with material updates when they are available. About Golden Sun Health Technology Group Limited Established in 1997 and headquartered in Shanghai, China, Golden Sun Health Technology Group Limited, formerly known as Golden Sun Education Group Limited, is a provider of tutorial services in China with over twenty years of experience providing educational services that focus on the development of each of its student’s strengths and potential, and the promotion of life-long skills and interests in learning.

The offering is managed by a consortium of top financial institutions, with the transaction set to close on April 9, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst MGM Resorts International's announcement of a significant public offering of senior notes is a strategic move aimed at improving the company's debt profile. The choice to issue notes at 6.500%, which is lower than the existing 6.750% notes due in 2025, indicates an attempt to capitalize on current market conditions to reduce interest expenses. This refinancing could potentially lead to improved net interest margins and lower overall borrowing costs for the company.Investors and analysts often scrutinize such transactions for their impact on a company's leverage, interest coverage ratios and overall financial health. The use of proceeds to repay existing higher-interest debt is a prudent approach that will likely be viewed favorably by the market, as it suggests a focus on financial discipline and creditworthiness. However, the introduction of new debt also requires careful monitoring of the company's leverage ratios and future cash flow projections. Debt Market Analyst The offering of $750 million in senior notes at a 6.500% interest rate reflects the current state of the credit markets and investor appetite for corporate debt. The involvement of a broad syndicate of well-known financial institutions as joint book-running managers and co-managers indicates a robust underwriting process and potentially strong demand for the notes.From a market perspective, the guarantee by MGM's domestic subsidiaries is a key point, as it underscores the credit quality of the offering. This guarantee structure is common in corporate debt offerings and provides an additional layer of security for investors, aligning with the company's existing senior indebtedness. The equal right of payment clause is also standard, ensuring that these new notes rank pari passu with other unsecured senior debt. Market Research Analyst MGM Resorts International operates in the hospitality and entertainment industry, which is sensitive to economic cycles. The decision to refinance existing debt can be seen as a proactive measure to strengthen the balance sheet against potential downturns. By locking in a lower interest rate for a longer maturity, the company might be positioning itself to weather any short-term market volatility while also planning for long-term growth.It is essential to consider the broader industry context, including tourism trends, consumer spending habits and regulatory changes that could impact MGM's operations. The success of this offering could send positive signals to the market about MGM's financial stability and strategic foresight, potentially influencing the stock's performance and investor sentiment. 03/25/2024 - 04:36 PM LAS VEGAS, March 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- MGM Resorts International (the ""Company"") (NYSE: MGM) today announced that it has priced a public offering of $750,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6.500% senior notes due 2032 at par.

The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the notes to repay existing indebtedness, including its outstanding 6.750% senior notes due 2025. Pending such use, the Company may invest the net proceeds in short-term interest-bearing accounts, securities or similar investments.

The company's cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023, totaled approximately $20.7 million, showcasing a healthy financial position. Volition aims to minimize dilution and achieve profitability by leveraging various revenue streams and funding sources. Management is optimistic about future milestones and the potential of their innovative products. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results disclosed by VolitionRx Limited represent a significant business development, particularly noting the 153% increase in revenue year-over-year. This uptick in sales, driven by the commercialization of the Nu.Q® Vet Cancer Test, indicates a successful penetration into the companion animal healthcare sector. The financial partnership with Heska Corporation, yielding $13.0 million in milestone payments, is a substantial liquidity event that bolsters the company's cash position, nearly doubling its year-end cash on hand to $20.7 million.However, the net cash used in operating activities, amounting to $18.1 million, suggests a high burn rate that investors should watch closely. The emphasis on achieving self-sustainability in various business pillars could mitigate future cash outflows. It's important to analyze subsequent quarterly results to assess whether these strategies are effectively reducing the cash burn and setting the stage for profitability. Biotechnology Market Analyst The strategic collaborations Volition has entered into, such as with Fujifilm Vet Systems and the anticipated in-house diagnostic test through Heska Corporation, are pivotal in expanding the company's market reach. These alliances not only enhance distribution channels but also validate the company's technological offerings within the industry.The reference to large-scale clinical studies and regulatory progress with the U.S. FDA signals forward momentum in product development and potential market expansion. The introduction of Capture-PCR™, highlighted as a breakthrough in cancer detection, could disrupt the market if clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness align with current healthcare demands. Investors should monitor peer-reviewed publications and industry reception to these innovations for a clearer assessment of their market potential and impact on the company's growth trajectory. Medical Research Analyst The advancements in Volition's Nu.Q® NETs and Capture-PCR™ technologies represent significant progress in the field of epigenetics and non-invasive cancer diagnostics. The ability to isolate tumor-derived ctDNA fragments from blood is a notable scientific achievement that could lead to earlier and more precise cancer detection.It's important to understand the clinical implications of these technologies. The upcoming publications will provide valuable insights into their accuracy, sensitivity and specificity compared to existing diagnostic methods. The FDA's regulatory pathway is also a critical factor in determining the speed at which these products can reach the market and their potential to become standard-of-care in oncology diagnostics. 03/25/2024 - 04:10 PM Conference call to discuss financial and operational results scheduled for Tuesday, March 26 at 8:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time HENDERSON, Nev., March 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- VolitionRx Limited (NYSE AMERICAN: VNRX) (""Volition""), a multi-national epigenetics company, today announced financial results and a business update for the full fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

Cameron Reynolds, President and Group Chief Executive Officer of Volition said: ""2023 was certainly transformational for Volition and a year we can look back on with pride. The commercialization of our Nu.Q® Vet Cancer Test within the companion animal healthcare sector resulted in kits and components for over 58,000 tests being sold in 2023 and has led to agreements with several new global and regional partners including, last week, with Fujifilm Vet Systems, Japan's leading veterinary diagnostic service provider. Looking just around the corner, the Nu.Q® Vet Cancer Test will soon be available as an in-house diagnostic test through Heska Corporation, an Antech company. ""I am very happy with the progress made in our Nu.Q® NETs pillar and in particular in determining our regulatory pathway forward with the U.S. FDA - a key milestone for the company - and in having a number of large-scale clinical studies due for publication later this year. ""I am also absolutely delighted with our breakthrough cancer detection method, Capture-PCR™, for which we presented a poster at the annual congress of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) in the fourth quarter of 2023. We believe that this is a true breakthrough moment – the first reported physical isolation of a class of tumor-derived ctDNA fragments from blood. ""We are focused on getting each of our several pillars of focus to support itself, either through product revenues, milestone payments, out-licensing or other non-dilutive funding in the coming year, as we have achieved in our Vet pillar. This is to ensure as little dilution as possible to reach profitability as a company. ""We have had a busy start to 2024 and look forward to delivering on some exciting milestones ahead, in particular publishing new data for Nu.Q® NETs and for our potential breakthrough cancer detection method, Capture-PCR™."" Financial Highlights Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023, totaled approximately $20.7 million as compared to $10.9 million as of December 31, 2022.Recorded approximately $775,000 in revenue in 2023, up 153% over the prior year.Received $13.0 million in milestone payments from Heska Corporation in December 2023.Net cash used in operating activities was $18.1 million for the full year.

Despite an increase in revenues, the company reported a net loss of RMB1,282.4 million for Q4 and RMB1,957.5 million for the fiscal year. Positive None. Negative The net loss for Dada Nexus in Q4 2023 was RMB1,282.4 million, a significant increase from the net loss of RMB370.6 million in the same period of 2022. The company reported a non-GAAP loss from operations of RMB190.2 million in Q4 2023, compared to RMB207.0 million in the same quarter of 2022. Dada Nexus experienced an impairment loss of goodwill amounting to RMB957.6 million in Q4 2023. The total costs and expenses for Dada Nexus in Q4 2023 were RMB4,077.9 million, compared to RMB3,114.9 million in the same quarter of 2022. Despite an increase in total net revenues for fiscal year 2023, Dada Nexus reported a net loss of RMB1,957.5 million, compared to RMB2,008.0 million in 2022. The company's non-GAAP net loss for fiscal year 2023 was RMB341.8 million, a decrease from RMB1,326.2 million in the previous year. Financial Analyst The financial results of Dada Nexus Limited indicate a mixed performance with a slight increase in total net revenues yet a significant net loss for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year of 2023. The contrasting trends between JDDJ Services and Dada Now Services revenue streams reflect diverging business segments within the company. The growth in Dada Now's intra-city delivery services suggests a strong market demand for such services, potentially driven by evolving consumer preferences and the acceleration of e-commerce. However, the substantial impairment loss of goodwill and increased operational costs, particularly rider costs, have adversely affected the company's profitability.Investors may be concerned about the company's ability to manage costs effectively and improve its bottom line, despite revenue growth in certain areas. The non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain expenses, show an improvement compared to the previous year, indicating some success in cost control and operational efficiency. However, the overall net loss and the decline in cash and cash equivalents year-over-year could raise questions about the company's financial sustainability and capital management strategy. Market Research Analyst The on-demand retail and delivery market in China is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer behavior. Dada's performance, particularly the increase in order volume for Dada Now, suggests that the company is capitalizing on the growing trend of intra-city delivery services. The decrease in promotional and marketing expenses may reflect a strategic shift towards more sustainable growth rather than aggressive customer acquisition. The decline in JDDJ's online advertising and marketing services revenue may indicate market saturation or increased competition.Long-term, the company's ESG scores and upgrades by S&P and MSCI could enhance its reputation among socially conscious investors and customers. These ESG achievements can be leveraged for brand differentiation and may contribute to customer loyalty and investor interest, aligning with a broader industry trend towards sustainable business practices. Economist From an economic perspective, the financial results of Dada Nexus Limited reflect the broader economic conditions affecting the on-demand delivery sector. The increase in rider costs is indicative of inflationary pressures and potentially a tighter labor market. These economic factors could continue to impact the company's operational expenses and margins.The shift in consumer spending towards convenience and the adoption of e-commerce facilitated by platforms like Dada Now may be part of a larger structural change in the economy. However, the company's ability to navigate economic headwinds and leverage its position in the market will be important for its long-term financial health. The reported net losses underscore the importance of strategic financial planning and the potential need for the company to explore new revenue streams or cost optimization strategies to improve its fiscal position. 03/25/2024 - 06:00 PM SHANGHAI, China, March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dada Nexus Limited (NASDAQ: DADA, “Dada” or the “Company”), China’s leading local on-demand retail and delivery platform, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

Net revenues generated from JDDJ increased by 4.5% from RMB6,210.0 million in 2022 to RMB6,491.8 million in 2023, mainly due to the increase in fulfillment services and commission fee, partially offset by the decrease in online advertising and marketing services.Net revenues generated from Dada Now increased by 27.1% from RMB3,157.6 million in 2022 to RMB4,014.5 million in 2023, mainly driven by the increase in order volume of intra-city delivery services provided to various chain merchants.

The decrease was primarily due to (i) a decrease in amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisition of JDDJ in 2016, (ii) a decrease in share-based compensation expenses.Research and development expenses were RMB416.3 million, compared with RMB630.9 million in 2022.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its business. For example, the Company uses non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income/(loss), non-GAAP net margin, and non-GAAP net income/(loss) per share as supplemental measures to review and assess its financial and operating performance. Non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations is income/(loss) from operations excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions and impairment loss of goodwill. Non-GAAP net income/(loss) is net income/(loss) excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions, tax benefit from amortization of such intangible assets, and impairment loss of goodwill. Non-GAAP net margin is non-GAAP net income/(loss) as a percentage of total net revenues. Non-GAAP net income/(loss) per share is non-GAAP net income/(loss) divided by weighted average number of shares used in calculating net income/(loss) per share. The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by the Company’s management to evaluate the Company’s financial and operating performance and formulate business plans. Non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations and non-GAAP net income/(loss) enable the Company’s management to assess the Company’s financial and operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions, tax benefit from amortization of such intangible assets, and impairment loss of goodwill. The Company also believes that the use of the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates investors’ assessment of the Company’s financial and operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company’s operations. Share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions, and tax benefit from amortization of such intangible assets have been and may continue to be incurred in the Company’s business and is not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. Impairment loss of goodwill is not considered by the management when evaluating the core operating results and may not be indicative of the Company's business outlook. Further, the non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, including peer companies, potentially limiting the comparability of their financial results to the Company’s. In light of the foregoing limitations, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measures, which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. For reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled, “Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results.” Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains statements that may constitute “forward-looking” statements pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Consolidated Financial Statements for the First, Second and Third Quarters of Fiscal Year 2023 As previously disclosed by the Company in its Form 6-K filed on January 8, 2024, the audit committee of its Board, with the assistance of independent professional advisers, initiated an independent review of certain suspicious practices that were identified during a routine internal audit by the Company and that might cast doubt on certain revenues from the Company’s online advertising and marketing services in 2023 (the “Independent Review”). Based on the findings of the Independent Review, the Company’s net revenues were overstated by approximately RMB40 million in the first quarter of 2023, RMB214 million in the second quarter of 2023, and RMB245 million in the third quarter of 2023, respectively. The Company’s operations and support costs were overstated by approximately RMB42 million in the first quarter of 2023, RMB214 million in the second quarter of 2023, and RMB250 million in the third quarter of 2023, respectively. Transactions at issue prior to fiscal year 2023 had immaterial impact on the Company’s financial statements, therefore no corrections were made to the previously issued unaudited/audited consolidated financial statements prior to fiscal year 2023.

The recently unveiled Gen 2 Polaris RZR Pro R Factory race vehicle performed flawlessly through the grueling 285-mile course, once again proving itself as the most superior UTV in the field. Fellow Polaris-supported racers secured the top finishes in UTV overall with Branden Sims in third to sweep the podium, Kristen Matlock in fifth and Polaris Factory Racing teammate Max Eddy Jr. in sixth, respectively. The starting order for the race was determined by random draw, from which Heger started in ninth, Craig Scanlon was 15th, Eddy Jr. 16th and MacCachren 18th. As the race got underway, Heger and his RZR Pro R Factory quickly took over the lead by mile marker 47. Teammates Eddy Jr. and MacCachren also made quick work of the competition ahead of them, moving swiftly from their starting positions to third and fifth within the same time. By race mile 150, Heger held a strong and commanding lead due to his methodical driving, with Eddy Jr. closing in on second. MacCachren had also gained a position, sitting in fourth. Throughout the next 100 miles, the Polaris Factory Racing drivers showcased the true power, strength, and control of the Gen 2 RZR Pro R Factory machines, tackling what many said to be the toughest and most grueling track on the Peninsula to date. By mile marker 200, the three factory racers were in position to sweep the podium with Heger first, Eddy Jr. second and MacCachren third. Over the final 50 miles of the race, MacCachren put his head down and began making up significant time on the leaders. By race mile 240, he was thirty seconds behind Heger on corrected time and third place physically on track. MacCachren continued to pick up the pace and decided to get crafty with his line selection, taking an alternative route in an effort to make up time , which ultimately paid dividends when he came out in second physically. Keeping on the gas, he was able to gain on Heger enough to take the checkered and secure the victory by a mere 13-seconds on corrected time at 5:14:05. Polaris Factory Racing would have taken the UTV Pro Open class podium sweep, but a time penalty for Eddy Jr. due to two missed VCP markers and a speed violation after the race dropped him from third to fifth, respectively. Craig Scanlon persevered throughout the race, working his way from 15th at the start to seventh by the checkered flag. ""It feels incredible to kick off the 2024 SCORE season where I left off at the Baja 1000, with an overall victory,"" said MacCachren. ""This San Felipe course was beyond brutal and unlike anything we've experienced before but my RZR Pro R Factory performed incredibly. I didn't think our vehicles could get any better but this Gen 2 machine is unreal, with incredible power and control while staying planted in the roughest parts of the course."" ""Today was unreal. To see our Polaris Factory Racing team completely dominate the field and come away with a 1-2 overall is a true testament to this program,"" said Alex Scheuerell, Polaris Factory Racing Technical Director. ""Our team worked so hard to develop this new Gen 2 RZR Pro R Factory so it's incredibly gratifying to see those efforts come to fruition and dominate the field. I want to thank the whole RZR engineering team for making such a great platform to start with, plus the Polaris race engineers and SCi group that built and prepped these impressive race machines.""

A 'Mandatory Panel Monitor' has been imposed for one year to ensure continued compliance. Waldencast sees this as a significant achievement and plans to provide updates on its fiscal year 2023 performance. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The announcement by Waldencast regarding its regained compliance with Nasdaq's filing requirements signifies a positive development for the company's corporate governance. The Periodic Filing Rule, mandated by Nasdaq, ensures that all listed companies provide timely and accurate financial information, which is critical for maintaining market integrity and investor trust. Waldencast's adherence to this rule, after presumably facing issues with compliance, is a reassuring signal to investors and may contribute to stabilizing the company's stock performance.Furthermore, the imposition of a 'Mandatory Panel Monitor' for a year is a remedial measure that underscores the importance of continuous compliance. While this oversight mechanism may be perceived as additional scrutiny, it also serves to assure stakeholders of the company's commitment to transparency. The market typically responds favorably to the resolution of compliance issues, as it eliminates one element of uncertainty regarding a company's operational standing. However, the underlying reasons for the initial non-compliance, which are not detailed here, could still be a concern for investors looking at the long-term health of the company. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Waldencast's successful filing of interim financial results and the subsequent compliance with Nasdaq's requirements may have implications for its fiscal health and access to capital markets. Timely filings are often a prerequisite for institutional investors and credit facilities and failure to meet these standards can lead to increased borrowing costs or limited access to funding. Now that compliance has been achieved, Waldencast might find it easier to secure financing and attract investment, which is essential for funding operations and growth initiatives in the competitive beauty and wellness sector.Investors will likely monitor the upcoming publication of Waldencast's 2023 20-F report closely, as it will provide a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance and strategic direction. Any positive trends in revenue growth, profitability, or market expansion could further bolster investor confidence and potentially lead to an uptick in the company's stock valuation. Conversely, any signs of financial distress or strategic missteps highlighted in the report could negatively impact the market's perception of the company's prospects. 03/25/2024 - 05:05 PM WHITE PLAINS, N.Y., March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Waldencast plc, (NASDAQ: WALD) (“Waldencast”), a global multi-brand beauty and wellness platform, announced that on March 21, 2024 the Company received formal notice from the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) confirming that it has regained compliance with Nasdaq’s filing requirements, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c) (the “Periodic Filing Rule”) following the filing of the Company’s financial results for the interim period ended June 30, 2023 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In line with the applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules in such circumstances, the notice also indicated that Nasdaq had imposed a “Mandatory Panel Monitor” as that term is defined in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B), for a period of one year from the date of the compliance determination (March 21, 2024), pursuant to which in the event the Company fails to timely satisfy the Periodic Filing Rule during the one-year monitor period, the Company will not have the opportunity to provide a compliance plan for the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff’s review; rather, Nasdaq would instead issue a delist determination pursuant to which the Company could request a hearing and stay of the delist determination pending another hearing before the Panel.

(CNM) announces the acquisition of EGW Utilities, Inc., expanding its product offerings in the underground utility industry. The deal brings together two teams with deep expertise, creating growth opportunities and value for customers.","Core & Main Signs Agreement to Acquire EGW Utilities Inc. Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Core & Main Inc. (CNM) announces the acquisition of EGW Utilities, Inc., expanding its product offerings in the underground utility industry. The deal brings together two teams with deep expertise, creating growth opportunities and value for customers. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of EGW Utilities by Core & Main represents a strategic move to bolster Core & Main's presence in the underground utility infrastructure sector. This transaction is indicative of the consolidation trend within the industry, aiming to leverage synergies and expand service offerings. The integration of EGW's technical expertise and customer relationships can potentially enhance Core & Main's competitive position.From a market perspective, such acquisitions often aim to achieve economies of scale, diversify product lines and solidify customer bases. The added capabilities and expanded geographic reach may enable Core & Main to tap into new markets and customer segments. However, the success of this acquisition will largely depend on the seamless integration of EGW's operations and the retention of its key personnel who hold valuable industry knowledge.It's also important to monitor the post-acquisition phase for potential operational efficiencies or difficulties that could impact Core & Main's profitability. Investors should watch for the company's future financial disclosures to assess the impact of the acquisition on revenue growth and cost synergies. Financial Analyst Core & Main's definitive agreement to acquire EGW Utilities is a capital allocation decision that will likely be scrutinized for its impact on Core & Main's financial health. The deal could lead to an immediate increase in debt or a dilution of equity depending on the financing structure. However, if executed effectively, it could result in accretive earnings and enhance shareholder value over time.The acquisition's success will hinge on Core & Main's ability to integrate EGW efficiently and realize anticipated synergies. Investors should look for signs of integration costs and how they compare to the expected benefits. Additionally, the long-term benefits such as cross-selling opportunities and increased market share could offset short-term integration costs.Given the nature of the infrastructure industry, where long-term contracts and relationships are key, the retention of EGW's customer base and the successful transfer of its 'know-how' will be critical for the financial success of the acquisition. Industrial Analyst The acquisition of EGW Utilities by Core & Main is a significant development in the infrastructure products distribution industry. It reflects Core & Main's strategic intent to deepen its expertise in the underground utility sector. EGW's track record of reliable service and strong customer relationships could enhance Core & Main's operational capabilities and service quality.The underground utility market is highly specialized and the demand for innovative solutions is growing due to aging infrastructure and increased investment in utility upgrades. Core & Main's acquisition of a company with two decades of experience like EGW could provide them with a competitive edge in terms of product knowledge and customer trust.However, the integration of such specialized companies poses risks, especially regarding the alignment of corporate cultures and the potential loss of key employees who possess critical technical knowledge. Ensuring a smooth transition will be essential for maintaining service standards and customer satisfaction. 03/25/2024 - 04:21 PM ST. LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Core & Main Inc.

(DNMR) Sale of 15,000,000 shares of common stock at $1.00 per share with accompanying warrants to purchase additional shares at $1.33 per share Roth Capital Partners acted as the exclusive placement agent for the offering Net proceeds to be utilized for working capital and general corporate purposes Negative None. Market Research Analyst The closing of Danimer Scientific's registered direct offering represents a significant capital infusion for the company, amounting to approximately $15 million. This development is noteworthy for investors as it directly impacts the company's financial position and liquidity. The offering price at $1.00 per share, along with the exercise price of the warrants at $1.33, indicates a strategic pricing decision meant to attract investors while providing potential upside through the warrants.From a market perspective, the use of proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes suggests that Danimer Scientific is aiming to strengthen its operational capabilities. This move could be seen as a response to the increasing demand for sustainable materials, positioning the company to capitalize on the growing bioplastics market. The timing and terms of the capital raise may reflect current market conditions and investor appetite for environmentally focused companies.However, investors should consider the dilutive effect of adding 15 million new shares, plus the potential for an additional 15 million shares if the warrants are exercised. This dilution could impact the stock's value in the short term, although the long-term effects depend on how effectively the company deploys the new capital. Financial Analyst Examining the financial implications of Danimer Scientific's registered direct offering, the immediate liquidity boost of $15 million stands out. This capital increase is essential for the company's short-term financial health, allowing it to navigate the competitive bioplastics industry with more agility. The use of a 'shelf' registration statement for this offering indicates a pre-planned capital raising strategy, enabling the company to act quickly when market conditions are favorable.Investors should note the involvement of Roth Capital Partners as the exclusive placement agent, which may lend credibility to the offering and potentially attract institutional investors. However, the offering's impact on earnings per share (EPS) must be closely monitored, as the issuance of additional shares could lead to earnings dilution.Long-term, the success of this capital raise will be measured by how effectively Danimer Scientific deploys the funds towards profitable initiatives. If the company can leverage this capital to innovate and capture more market share, the dilution may be offset by future earnings growth. Sustainability Analyst Within the context of sustainable business practices, Danimer Scientific's capital raise is a strategic move to solidify its position in the bioplastics industry. The company's focus on biodegradable materials aligns with global trends towards sustainability and reducing plastic waste. This offering could enable further research and development into new bioplastic formulations or scaling up production to meet market demand.Investors with an interest in environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria may find this offering appealing, given the company's potential to contribute positively to environmental sustainability. However, the true measure of impact will be how the company utilizes the funds to create long-term value while advancing its sustainability goals. The balance between financial performance and environmental responsibility will be important in evaluating the success of this investment. 03/25/2024 - 04:15 PM BAINBRIDGE, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Danimer Scientific, Inc. (NYSE: DNMR) (the “Company” or “Danimer Scientific”), a leading next generation bioplastics company focused on the development and production of biodegradable materials, today announced the closing of its previously announced registered direct offering for the purchase and sale of 15,000,000 shares of common stock (or common stock equivalent in lieu thereof) at a purchase price of $1.00 per share (or per common stock equivalent in lieu thereof) and accompanying warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 15,000,000 shares of common stock . The warrants have an exercise price of $1.33 per share, will be exercisable commencing six months from the date of issuance and will expire five and one-half years following the date of issuance. Roth Capital Partners acted as the exclusive placement agent for the offering. The gross proceeds to the Company from the offering were approximately $15 million before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. The common stock (or common stock equivalent in lieu thereof) and warrants described above were offered by the Company pursuant to a “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-267074) that was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on September 7, 2022.

Negative Net loss increased compared to the prior year. Lower CNG sales volumes in India market and IAM volumes in Africa. Negative impact of inventory write-downs related to heavy-duty, light-duty, and IAM businesses. Adjusted EBITDA loss of $21.5 million. Cash used in operating activities was $13.2 million. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Westport Fuel Systems Inc. indicate a mixed performance with record revenues of $331.8 million for the year 2023, up 9% from the previous year. However, this top-line growth is overshadowed by a substantial net loss of $49.7 million, a 52% increase from the prior year's loss. The growth in revenue can be attributed to increased sales volumes in certain segments, but the company faced challenges in the form of lower CNG sales in India, decreased IAM volumes in Africa and lower hydrogen business sales. A critical factor contributing to the net loss is the absence of equity income from the sale of the Cummins Westport Inc. joint venture interest in the previous year, coupled with the loss on extinguishment of debt and increased expenses.Furthermore, the company's gross margin improved by 35% to $48.9 million, reflecting higher sales volumes and engineering service revenues. Yet, the negative impact of inventory write-downs and higher input costs due to global supply chain challenges cannot be overlooked. The adjusted EBITDA loss of $21.5 million, although an improvement from the previous year, still raises concerns about the company's operational efficiency. The added term loans of $11.5 million suggest an attempt to improve financial flexibility, but they also increase the company's debt burden.Investors should consider the balance between the company's revenue growth and the factors contributing to the net loss. The increased debt and the potential for continued losses could weigh on the stock's performance, despite revenue growth. The company's focus on operational efficiency and financial strength will be important in turning the increased revenues into profitability. Market Research Analyst Westport Fuel Systems Inc.'s strategic focus on expanding into new markets and adapting to regulatory changes is a positive sign for future growth. The development contract valued at $33 million with a global heavy truck manufacturer and the proof of concept project for locomotive applications demonstrate the company's commitment to innovation and diversification. The formation of a joint venture with Volvo Group to commercialize HPDI fuel system technology is particularly noteworthy, as it could enhance the company's competitive position in alternative fuels.However, the operational and segment highlights reveal a mixed performance. While there are increases in revenue and gross margin in some areas, there are also setbacks, such as lower sales volumes in the hydrogen business and negative impacts on gross margins due to inventory write-downs. The company's efforts to enter new markets and improve operational excellence through cost-cutting measures and process streamlining are essential strategies that may help mitigate the impact of these challenges in the long run.Analyzing the industry outlook, the hydrogen project pipeline and the anticipated investments signal a growing market for alternative fuels. Westport's positioning in this space could offer significant opportunities, but it is essential to monitor how the company capitalizes on these trends and manages the transition to profitability. The company's focus on harnessing the potential of its HPDI joint venture, improving operational excellence and continuous innovation could be pivotal in achieving success in a competitive landscape. Energy Sector Analyst Westport Fuel Systems Inc.'s engagement in the alternative fuels sector, particularly in hydrogen fuel technologies, aligns with global trends towards decarbonization and cleaner energy sources. The company's initiatives, such as the H2 HPDI proof of concept project and the joint venture with Volvo Group, suggest an aggressive pursuit of leadership in the hydrogen-powered future. The industry's move toward zero-emission transport and the expected competitive pricing of hydrogen against traditional fuels by the 2030s could be a significant tailwind for Westport.The company's strategic pillars, which include harnessing the HPDI joint venture, enhancing operational excellence and innovating for a hydrogen-powered future, are aligned with industry trends. However, the financial impact of these initiatives remains to be seen. The current financial performance shows significant losses and the company's ability to transition its strategic initiatives into financially viable outcomes will be critical for investor confidence.Investors should also consider the potential risks associated with the regulatory and government approvals required for the joint venture's operational start. Delays or unfavorable outcomes could affect the company's strategic plans. Additionally, the global supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures on production input costs present ongoing challenges that could affect future gross margins and operational efficiencies. 03/25/2024 - 05:00 PM VANCOUVER, BC, March 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Westport Fuel Systems Inc. (""Westport"") (TSX: WPRT) (Nasdaq: WPRT) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, and provided an update on operations. All figures are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated. ""I am privileged to report that despite challenges last year, we achieved new milestones, evolved strategically, and prioritized operational efficiency and financial strength and, in doing so, we generated record revenues. Consistent with our priority to drive sustainable growth, our team increased sales volumes in our delayed OEM and electronics, and fuel storage businesses, while also increasing the engineering services we delivered in our heavy-duty OEM business. As we progress, Westport is dedicated to growth and adaptability, continuing to innovate and evolve with the ever-changing regulatory and macro-economic landscapes. Anticipating the road ahead, I am resolved to steer Westport through strategic and decisive actions. Our success hinges on seamlessly integrating disciplined operations with a robust strategic framework. To this end, I will guide our efforts towards three essential pillars: harnessing the potential of our HPDI joint venture to drive success, enhancing operational excellence, and continuous innovation to shape the world's hydrogen-powered future. We have a lot of work ahead of us. With a dedicated team and the unwavering pursuit of excellence, I have full confidence in our capacity to not only meet but exceed our objectives."" Dan Sceli, Chief Executive Officer Financial Highlights Revenue of $331.8 million for 2023 and $87.2 million for the fourth quarter. Full year results were primarily driven by increased sales volumes in the delayed OEM, electronics and fuel storage businesses, as well as additional engineering service revenues from the heavy-duty OEM businesses. This growth is partially offset by the negative impact of the lower CNG sales volumes to customers in the India market, lower independent aftermarket sales (""IAM"") volumes in Africa, and lower sales volumes in the hydrogen business.Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $49.7 million, or $2.90 loss per share, compared to net loss of $32.7 million for the prior year. Net loss for the fourth quarter in 2023 was $13.9 million, or $0.81 loss per share, compared to net loss of $16.9 million, or $1.00 loss per share, for the same period in 2022. For the year, the increase in net loss was primarily attributed to the absence of equity income from the prior year's sale of our interest in the Cummins Westport Inc. (""CWI"") joint venture, the loss on extinguishment of debt due to the settlement of the Cartesian royalty payable, and increases in expenses, which was partially offset by an increase in gross margin and includes the negative impact of inventory write-downs related to the heavy-duty, light-duty and IAM businesses.Adjusted EBITDA1 loss of $21.5 million, compared to a loss of $27.8 million in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was a loss of $10.0 million.Cash and cash equivalents were $54.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Operational Highlights Westport closed 2023 focused on driving sustainable growth in our existing markets, unlocking new and emerging markets, driving operational excellence, and extracting efficiencies through prudent capital management. Based on these priorities, Westport can report several achievements that occurred during and subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2023. Entering new markets with a two-year H2 HPDI proof of concept project with a leading global provider of locomotives and related equipment for the freight and transit rail industries. The project will adapt Westport's H2 HPDI™ fuel system for use with the locomotive OEM engine design.Awarded a development contract with an estimated value of $33 million with a global heavy truck manufacturer to adapt and commercialize the next generation LNG (""Liquified Natural Gas"") HPDI fuel system for the Euro 7 vehicle platform.Westport, together with Volvo Group, completed the signing of the investment agreement to form a joint venture to accelerate the commercialization and global adoption of Westport's HPDI fuel system technology for long-haul and off-road applications. The closing of the joint venture is subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory and government approvals. It is anticipated that the joint venture will become operational following the formal closing, which is expected in the second quarter of 2024.Early in the first quarter of 2024, the initial Euro 6 LPG fuel systems were delivered to our global OEM customer related to our expanded LPG supply agreement for Euro 6 and Euro 7 vehicle platforms.__________________________ 1 Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation is a non-GAAP measure. Please refer to GAAP and NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES in Westport's Management Discussion and Analysis for the reconciliation. Segment Information Original Equipment Manufacturer (""OEM"") OEM revenue for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 was $61.2 million and $222.8 million, respectively, compared with $47.8 million and $198.0 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2022. The increase of $13.4 million as compared to the fourth quarter 2022 was primarily driven by higher sales volumes in the light-duty OEM and electronics businesses and higher engineering service revenue from the heavy-duty OEM business. This was partially offset by lower sales volumes in heavy-duty OEM, delayed OEM and fuel storage businesses compared to the prior year. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by $24.8 million compared to the prior year, primarily driven by increased sales volumes in the delayed OEM, electronics and fuel storage businesses, and higher engineering service revenue from the heavy-duty OEM business as well as increased sales volumes in Eastern Europe for our light duty business. This was partially offset by lower sales volumes in our hydrogen business and lower sales in the light-duty OEM business in India. Gross margin2 increased by $1.6 million to $0.8 million, or 1% of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to negative $0.8 million, or negative 2% of revenue, for the same prior year period. The increase in gross margin for the three months ended December 31, 2023 is driven primarily by increased sales volumes in the light-duty OEM and electronics businesses, as well as increased gross margin in the heavy-duty OEM business due to higher engineering service revenue. The heavy-duty OEM business was negatively impacted by a $4.5 million inventory write-down. In addition, the increased gross margin is partially offset by lower sales volumes in the fuel storage business, a negative sales mix in the hydrogen business, and the higher production input costs stemming from global supply chain challenges and inflation in logistics, utilities, labor and other costs, which we have only partially been able to pass on to our OEM customers. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by $11.7 million to $25.3 million, or 11% of revenue, compared to $13.6 million, or 7% of revenue, for the prior year. The increase in gross margin and gross margin percentage for the year ended December 31, 2023 is primarily driven by higher contribution margins from engineering services and higher volumes sales in the delayed OEM and fuel storage businesses. This was offset by lower margins in the hydrogen business due to lower sales volumes and a negative impact on the heavy-duty OEM business due to a $4.5 million inventory write-down. _______________________________ 2 Gross margin is a non-GAAP measure. Please refer to GAAP and NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES in Westport's Management Discussion and Analysis for the reconciliation. Independent Aftermarket Revenue for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 was $26.0 million and $109.0 million, respectively, compared with $30.2 million and $107.7 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $4.2 million compared to the prior year period was primarily driven by lower sales volumes in the Africa and South America markets offset by increased sales volumes in Europe. The increase in IAM revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1.3 million compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher sales volumes to South America offset by lower sales to Europe and Africa. Gross margin for the three months ended December 31, 2023 increased by $1.8 million to $7.2 million, or 28% of revenue, compared to $5.4 million, or 18% of revenue, for the same prior year period, primarily driven by the positive sales mix, lower electronic component costs and increased volumes sales in Europe. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by $1.0 million to $23.6 million, or 22% of revenue, compared to $22.6 million, or 21% of revenue, for the prior year, primarily driven by higher margins and a positive sales mix in South America. This was partially offset by a negative sales mix in Africa.

Specifically, the hydrogen project pipeline has approximately 1,400 projects announced globally, with investments totaling US$570 billion and 45 million tons per annum of clean hydrogen supply announced through 20303. Over the same period, hydrogen is expected to not only become more available but also more affordable. As government policies and regulatory changes worldwide accelerate the shift towards zero emissions, Westport's alternative fuel-based solutions enable its customers to deliver cleaner performance with practical and affordable applications today. We expect demand for our products and services to continue increasing and the widespread transition to hydrogen-based transport to be competitive with traditional fuels by the 2030s. As we progress, Westport is dedicated to growth and adaptability, continuing to innovate and evolve with the ever-changing regulatory and macro-economic landscape. Our efforts in 2024 will be guided towards three essential pillars: harnessing the potential of our HPDI joint venture to drive success, enhancing operational excellence, and continuous innovation to shape the world's hydrogen-powered future. Our success relies on these three essential pillars over the near-, medium- and long-term, respectively: 1) Driving Success Via Our HPDI Joint Venture Our HPDI joint venture marks a new era for Westport, culminating over two decades of dedication and innovation. The joint venture is a cornerstone of Westport's business strategy moving forward and it is time to innovate and drive growth together. Looking to the future, the joint venture will leverage the collective expertise of the partners, capitalize on growth opportunities, and solidify our position as a leader in alternative fuels. 2) Improving Operational Excellence We are relentless in our pursuit of operational excellence, embarking on bold initiatives to streamline processes, enhance efficiency, and reduce costs. Notably, our restructuring endeavors in India exemplify our commitment to optimizing capital efficiency and maximizing throughput across all operational fronts. We are starting to deploy a combination of levers to grow earnings and improve profitability, including implementing significant cost-cutting measures expected to encompass both operating and general and administrative expenses. 3) Reimagining A Hydrogen-Powered Future Embracing the potential for alternative fuels, particularly hydrogen, is exciting as we position ourselves at the forefront of this transformative shift. Armed with advanced technological capabilities, leveraging our existing hydrogen components business and a deep understanding of the market dynamics and customer needs, we are primed to capitalize on emerging growth opportunities while maintaining our commitment to sustainability and relevance in an ever-evolving landscape. _______________________ 3 Source: Hydrogen Insights 2023"", Hydrogen Council and McKinsey & Company, December 2023 Conference call Westport has scheduled a conference call for Tuesday March 26, 2024, at 7:00 am Pacific Time (10:00 am Eastern Time) to discuss these results.

Readers should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they were made. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise such statements to reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in these forward looking statements except as required by National Instrument 51-102. The contents of any website, RSS feed or twitter account referenced in this press release are not incorporated by reference herein. GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""U.S. GAAP""). These U.S. GAAP financial statements include non-cash charges and other charges and benefits that may be unusual or infrequent in nature or that we believe may make comparisons to our prior or future performance difficult. In addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Westport and certain investors use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as an indicator of our ability to generate liquidity by producing operating cash flow to fund working capital needs, service debt obligations and fund capital expenditures. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures in its review and evaluation of the financial performance of Westport. EBITDA is also frequently used by investors and analysts for valuation purposes whereby EBITDA is multiplied by a factor or ""EBITDA multiple"" that is based on an observed or inferred relationship between EBITDA and market values to determine the approximate total enterprise value of a company. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures also provide additional insight to investors and securities analysts as supplemental information to our U.S. GAAP results and as a basis to compare our financial performance period-over-period and to compare our financial performance with that of other companies. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons of our core operating results from period to period and to other companies by, in the case of EBITDA, removing the effects of our capital structure (net interest income on cash deposits, interest expense on outstanding debt and debt facilities), asset base (depreciation and amortization) and tax consequences. Adjusted EBITDA provides this same indicator of Westports' EBITDA from continuing operations and removing such effects of our capital structure, asset base and tax consequences, but additionally excludes any unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses, stock-based compensation charges and other one-time impairments and costs which are not expected to be repeated in order to provide greater insight into the cash flow being produced from our operating business, without the influence of extraneous events. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are intended to provide additional information to investors and analysts and do not have any standardized definition under U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude the impact of cash costs of financing activities and taxes, and the effects of changes in operating working capital balances, and therefore are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under U.S. GAAP. Other companies may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently.

LEGGETT & PLATT AMENDS CREDIT AGREEMENT,2024-03-25T20:10:00.000Z,Low,Very Positive,"Leggett & Platt, a diversified manufacturer, has amended its credit agreement to increase borrowing capacity and financial flexibility.

The leverage ratio has been raised from 3.5x to 4.0x until June 30, 2025, reverting back to 3.5x thereafter. President and CEO Mitch Dolloff emphasizes the company's commitment to financial strength amidst weak market demand. Leggett continues to focus on maintaining a stable financial position and evaluating capital allocation priorities. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The amendment of Leggett & Platt's credit agreement to increase the leverage ratio from 3.5x to 4.0x of trailing 12-months adjusted EBITDA signals a strategic move to bolster liquidity amidst a period of weakened demand in residential markets. This adjustment provides the company with a wider margin for debt relative to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can be interpreted as a cushion during economic headwinds. However, it is important to note that a higher leverage ratio also indicates increased financial risk. The reverting of the ratio back to 3.5x in 2025 suggests a planned return to a more conservative financial structure in the medium term.From an investor's perspective, the key takeaway is the company's proactive approach to maintaining financial health. The increased borrowing capacity might support ongoing operations and strategic investments, potentially stabilizing stock performance in the near term. However, stakeholders should monitor the company's debt levels and interest coverage ratios closely, as the increased leverage could impact future financial flexibility and profitability. Market Research Analyst The mention of 'near-term weak demand in residential end markets' by Leggett & Platt's CEO Mitch Dolloff provides context for the company's decision to amend its credit agreement. It reflects broader industry trends where manufacturers are facing demand fluctuations, possibly due to economic uncertainty or shifts in consumer behavior. The company's response, focusing on liquidity and financial flexibility, is a common strategy to navigate such periods.Investors should consider the company's historical performance in managing debt and its ability to generate cash flow from operations. Leggett & Platt's approach to evaluating capital allocation, including its dividend program, is indicative of a balanced strategy aimed at shareholder value while safeguarding the company's financial stability. The long-term success of the company will hinge on its operational efficiency and the effectiveness of its strategy in adapting to market conditions. 03/25/2024 - 04:10 PM CARTHAGE, Mo., March 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Diversified manufacturer Leggett & Platt announced today that it has entered into an amended agreement for its existing revolving credit facility to provide additional borrowing capacity and financial flexibility. Pursuant to the terms of the amended agreement, the Company has increased the leverage ratio under the financial covenant from 3.5x to 4.0x trailing 12-months adjusted EBITDA¹ through June 30, 2025. The leverage ratio will revert to 3.5x as of September 30, 2025, and remain at 3.5x until the facility's maturity date on September 30, 2026. President and CEO Mitch Dolloff commented, ""The amended credit agreement reflects our commitment to maintaining our long-held financial strength. We are confident that the amended agreement will provide us with ample liquidity and flexibility as we manage near-term weak demand in residential end markets."" Dolloff continued, ""As a Board and management team, we are carefully evaluating our capital allocation priorities, including the amount of cash allocated to our dividend program, to ensure that we maintain a strong and stable financial position as we execute our operating initiatives and drive the long-term success of Leggett.""

(AGRX) faces Nasdaq delisting due to failure to meet stockholders' equity requirement, but will continue trading on the OTC Market. The company remains focused on business operations and growth opportunities.","Agile Therapeutics Announces Delisting from Nasdaq Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Agile Therapeutics, Inc. (AGRX) faces Nasdaq delisting due to failure to meet stockholders' equity requirement, but will continue trading on the OTC Market. The company remains focused on business operations and growth opportunities. Positive None. Negative AGRX received a final delisting notice from Nasdaq due to failure to comply with the minimum stockholders' equity requirement, leading to suspension of trading on Nasdaq and transition to the OTC Market. Financial Analyst The delisting of Agile Therapeutics from the Nasdaq represents a significant shift in the company's financial landscape. Typically, when a company is delisted, it's an indication of financial distress or failure to meet regulatory requirements. In Agile's case, it's the latter—non-compliance with the stockholders' equity threshold. This transition to the OTC Market can lead to reduced liquidity and investor interest, as OTC markets are generally perceived as less prestigious and may attract fewer institutional investors. Furthermore, the reduced visibility and investor scrutiny on OTC markets can lead to more volatile stock prices.However, it's important to note that the company's operations remain unaffected by the delisting and their commitment to executing their business plan remains steadfast. While the OTC Market is a step down from Nasdaq in terms of prestige, it still provides a platform for public trading. Investors should closely monitor the company's strategic moves post-delisting, as they seek to maximize the growth potential of their product, Twirla. The ability to maintain SEC registration and continue filing reports should provide some level of reassurance regarding ongoing transparency and regulatory compliance. Market Research Analyst Agile Therapeutics' delisting is an event that could potentially alter the perception of the company in the market. Historical data suggests that companies moving to the OTC Market often face a reevaluation from stakeholders due to the perceived increased risk. This perception could impact the company's ability to raise capital and may affect its valuation. It's essential for investors to analyze the company's market position, its product pipeline and the competitive landscape of women's healthcare to gauge the potential impact on the company's future performance.Twirla, Agile's lead product, is in a competitive sector where innovation and market penetration are key drivers of success. The company's focus on maximizing Twirla's growth is important and their search for strategic opportunities should be closely watched. Investors should consider the company's ability to navigate the challenges of operating in the OTC Market while maintaining the momentum of their product offerings. 03/25/2024 - 04:30 PM PRINCETON, N.J., March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Agile Therapeutics, Inc.

Decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments from $71.0 million in 2022 to $40.9 million in 2023. Biotech Industry Analyst The financial results and clinical updates from Equillium, Inc. are a significant indicator of the company's trajectory and potential impact on the biotech sector. The reported cash balance of $40.9 million signals a stable financial position, providing a runway into the second half of 2025. This timeline is important for investors as it offers a clear window for the company's operational sustainability without the immediate need for additional capital raising, which can dilute share value.The completion of the Phase 2 clinical study enrollment for EQ101, targeting alopecia areata, is noteworthy. Current treatments for this condition have considerable side effects and a safer alternative could capture a substantial market share. The anticipation of topline data in Q2 2024 means that investors should be attentive to this potential catalyst for stock volatility. Furthermore, the possibility of a $331 million payment from Ono Pharmaceutical upon exercising their option for itolizumab rights could significantly bolster Equillium's financials and extend its cash runway, which is a positive sign for shareholder value. Pharmaceutical R&D Expert The positive data from the Phase 1b EQUALISE study of itolizumab in lupus nephritis presented at ASN and ACR meetings is a promising development. The safety profile and response rates in highly proteinuric patients could indicate a strong therapeutic potential for itolizumab. As lupus nephritis is a serious condition with limited treatment options, a new successful therapy could disrupt the market and provide significant revenue for Equillium.The advancement of EQ302 as a bi-specific inhibitor targeting IL-15 and IL-21 with improved potency and oral delivery is another strategic R&D move. If this inhibitor demonstrates efficacy in gastrointestinal indications, it could address a range of conditions with high unmet medical needs, such as celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease, which are areas of intense interest in the pharmaceutical industry. The potential market for effective treatments in these areas is substantial and a successful development could have a significant impact on the company's growth. Financial Analyst Equillium's reported revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 at $9.2 million, compared with $15.8 million for the same period in 2022, reflects a substantial change year-over-year. However, the full-year revenue growth from $15.8 million in 2022 to $36.1 million in 2023 is a strong positive indicator, driven by the development funding and amortization from the asset purchase agreement with Ono. This growth in revenue is a positive sign for investors, suggesting that the company's partnership strategy is paying off.The decrease in net loss for the full year of 2023 to $13.3 million from $62.4 million in 2022 is significant. This reduction is attributed to lower operating expenses and greater revenue related to the Ono partnership. Such financial health improvements are essential for investor confidence, particularly in the biotech industry where profitability is often long-term. The financial prudence demonstrated by the reduction in general and administrative expenses also reflects positively on company management. 03/25/2024 - 04:01 PM $40.9 million cash balance at the end of 2023 expected to provide cash runway into 2H 2025 Completed enrollment of Phase 2 clinical study of EQ101 in alopecia areata: topline data expected in Q2 2024 Presented positive data from Phase 1b EQUALISE study of itolizumab in lupus nephritis patients at American Society of Nephrology (ASN) & American College of Rheumatology (ACR) meetings Ono Pharmaceutical option exercise decision for itolizumab expected in 2H 2024 LA JOLLA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Equillium, Inc. (Nasdaq: EQ), a clinical-stage biotechnology company leveraging a deep understanding of immunobiology to develop novel therapeutics to treat severe autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, as well as corporate and clinical highlights. “The past year we have been focused on clinical execution that has set up the potential milestones we have in front of us in 2024,” said Bruce Steel, chief executive officer at Equillium. “The Phase 1b EQUALISE study of itolizumab in patients with lupus nephritis is now complete. We presented positive data from this study at the annual meetings of both ASN and ACR in the fourth quarter last year and we expect to deliver the topline data to our partner Ono in the coming weeks. We expect to announce the results of the interim review by the data monitoring committee of our Phase 3 EQUATOR study of itolizumab in patients with acute graft-versus-host disease in the third quarter, which would represent the final data deliverable to trigger Ono’s option exercise period, which will expire three months following such deliverables. If Ono exercises their option to acquire our rights to itolizumab we would receive an exercise payment of approximately $331 million, which would significantly extend our cash runway beyond the second half of 2025 - our current guidance - and we would remain eligible to receive approximately $101 million in additional milestone payments. “Our lead multi-cytokine inhibitor, EQ101, a first in class, tri-specific inhibitor targeting IL-2, IL-9 and IL-15, has completed enrollment in a Phase 2 study for the treatment of moderate to severe alopecia areata. There remains a large unmet medical need for safer alternatives to JAK inhibitors, which carry black-box warnings and are today the only approved class of drugs to treat alopecia areata patients. This is the first study in which EQ101 has been tested in alopecia areata patients, where we are looking for signs of clinical activity above historically low observed placebo responses. We’re pleased to have completed enrollment of this study and look forward to announcing topline data in the second quarter this year.” “In addition to clinical execution, we have also focused efforts on advancing the rest of our novel multi-cytokine inhibitor programs,” said Steve Connelly, chief scientific officer at Equillium. “EQ302, our first-in-class, bi-specific inhibitor of IL-15 and IL-21, is a second-generation peptide with improved potency that is orally deliverable and stable in the gut. We believe this represents a compelling product profile well positioned to target gastrointestinal indications including celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and eosinophilic esophagitis. We look forward to advancing this program towards the clinic.” Q4 2023 Highlights: Presented positive data from the Phase 1b EQUALISE study of itolizumab in lupus nephritis patients at the annual meetings of both ASN and ACR. The presentations highlighted a well-tolerated safety profile and data that demonstrated high complete and partial response rates with rapid and deep reductions in urine protein creatinine ratios in highly proteinuric patients when itolizumab was added to mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids. Hosted an Analyst & Investor Day featuring Arash Mostaghimi, MD, MPA, MPH, associate professor of dermatology at Harvard Medical School, that highlighted Equillium’s pipeline, the multi-cytokine platform and clinical-stage multi-cytokine inhibitors, with a focus on EQ101, currently in a Phase 2 clinical study for moderate to severe alopecia areata. Announced a presentation at the 18th Annual Peptide Therapeutics Symposium highlighting EQ302, a first-in-class, second generation, orally deliverable multi-cytokine inhibitor targeting IL-15 and IL-21. The presentation outlined the origins of EQ302 from its parent peptide and data illustrating that adding hydrocarbon staples to the peptide conferred increased stability in the gastrointestinal tract while retaining its cytokine inhibitory properties. Anticipated Upcoming Milestones: EQ101: Phase 2 clinical study in subjects with moderate to severe alopecia areata – topline data anticipated in Q2 2024 Itolizumab: EQUALISE lupus nephritis topline data to Ono anticipated in the coming weeks; EQUATOR acute graft-versus-host disease interim review anticipated in Q3 2024 Ono option exercise decision anticipated in 2H 2024 Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $9.2 million, compared with $15.8 million for the same period in 2022. For the full year of 2023, revenue was $36.1 million, compared with $15.8 million for the full year of 2022. Revenue in 2023 and 2022 consisted entirely of itolizumab development funding and amortization of the upfront payment from Ono resulting from the Asset Purchase Agreement with Ono executed in December 2022, which included such development funding retroactive to the beginning of the third quarter of 2022. Research and development (R&D) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $9.2 million, compared with $8.5 million for the same period in 2022. For the full year of 2023, R&D expenses were $37.0 million, compared with $37.5 million for the full year of 2022. The nominal year-over-year decrease in R&D expenses was driven by a decrease in non-clinical research expenses and lower employee compensation and benefits, which were partially offset by increased clinical development expenses, primarily driven by the EQUATOR, EQ101 and EQ102 clinical studies. General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $3.2 million, compared with $5.2 million for the same period in 2022. For the full year of 2023, G&A expenses were $13.6 million, compared with $17.2 million for the full year of 2022. The year-over-year decrease was driven by decreased legal expenses primarily related to 2022 business development activities, lower employee compensation and benefits, and lower consulting and general overhead expenses, which were partially offset by greater audit and tax related professional fees. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $2.3 million, or $(0.07) per basic share and diluted share, compared with net income of $2.8 million, or $0.08 per basic and diluted share for the same period in 2022. Net loss for the full year of 2023 was $13.3 million, or $(0.38) per basic and diluted share, compared with a net loss of $62.4 million, or $(1.85) per basic and diluted share for the full year of 2022. The decrease in net loss for the full year of 2023 compared to the full year of 2022 was primarily due to lower operating expenses driven by the non-cash in-process R&D expense related to the acquisition of Bioniz Therapeutics, Inc. in 2022 and lower G&A expenses, greater revenue related to the Ono partnership, greater income on investments, and less interest expense due to the retirement of our former debt facility, which was partially offset by greater income tax expense. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $40.9 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $71.0 million as of December 31, 2022. Net cash used in operating activities in the fourth quarter was $5.7 million. Equillium believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, will be sufficient to fund its currently planned operations into the second half of 2025, assuming no further repurchases under our stock repurchase program. About Multi-Cytokine Platform and Multi-Cytokine Inhibitors EQ101 & EQ302 Our proprietary multi-cytokine platform generates rationally designed composite peptides that selectively block key cytokines at the shared receptor level targeting pathogenic cytokine redundancies and synergies while preserving non-pathogenic signaling. This approach is expected to avoid the broad immuno-suppression and off-target safety liabilities that may be associated with other therapeutic classes, such as Janus kinase inhibitors. Many immune-mediated diseases are driven by the same combination of dysregulated cytokines, and we believe identifying the key cytokines for these diseases will allow us to target and develop customized treatment strategies for multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Current platform assets include EQ101, a clinical stage, first-in-class, selective, tri-specific inhibitor of IL-2, IL-9, and IL-15 for intravenous and subcutaneous delivery and EQ302, a preclinical stage, first-in-class, selective, bi-specific inhibitor of IL-15 and IL-21 for oral delivery. About Itolizumab Itolizumab is a clinical-stage, first-in-class anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody that selectively targets the CD6-ALCAM signaling pathway to downregulate pathogenic T effector cells while preserving T regulatory cells critical for maintaining a balanced immune response. This pathway plays a central role in modulating the activity and trafficking of T cells that drive a number of immuno-inflammatory diseases. About Equillium Equillium is a clinical-stage biotechnology company leveraging a deep understanding of immunobiology to develop novel therapeutics to treat severe autoimmune and inflammatory disorders with high unmet medical need.

Revenue for 2023 was $8.8 million, net loss was $104.7 million, research and development expenses were $82.2 million, and general and administrative expenses were $41.3 million. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financials of Stoke Therapeutics, with a cash reserve of $201.4 million, suggest a runway extending to the end of 2025. This is a significant indicator of the company's short-term financial health and operational stability. The ability to fund operations without the immediate need for additional capital is a positive signal for investors, as it reduces the risk of dilution from potential future equity offerings. However, it is important to monitor the burn rate and whether the projected runway aligns with the company's milestones, especially in the volatile biotech sector.Observing the year-on-year decrease in revenue from license fees and services, from $12.4 million in 2022 to $8.8 million in 2023, reflects a contraction that may raise concerns about the company's ability to generate consistent revenue streams. Furthermore, the increased net loss and operating expenses suggest that the company is intensifying its investment in research and development, which is common in the biotech industry as companies progress through clinical trials and regulatory processes. Biotechnology Market Analyst Stoke Therapeutics' focus on RNA-based medicines for severe diseases places it in a highly innovative and competitive segment of the biotechnology market. The financial commitment to R&D, evidenced by the increased expenditure in this area, is important for advancing their therapeutic candidates, STK-001 and STK-002. The biotech industry often sees significant R&D investments long before profitability, with the understanding that successful drug development can lead to substantial returns upon regulatory approval and market entry.It is also noteworthy that the general and administrative costs have risen, which is typical for a growing public company. Stakeholders should evaluate how these investments translate into corporate governance, compliance and overall corporate growth strategies. In the long term, the success of Stoke's therapeutic candidates will be pivotal in justifying these expenditures and in potentially delivering shareholder value. 03/25/2024 - 04:01 PM – As of December 31, 2023, Company had $201.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, anticipated to fund operations to the end of 2025 – BEDFORD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Stoke Therapeutics, Inc.

Stoke is pursuing the development of STK-002 for the treatment of autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA), the most common inherited optic nerve disorder. Stoke’s initial focus is haploinsufficiencies and diseases of the central nervous system and the eye, although proof of concept has been demonstrated in other organs, tissues, and systems, supporting its belief in the broad potential for its proprietary approach.

The underwriters have an option to purchase an additional 750,000 shares. The company plans to use the proceeds for acquiring a portfolio of industrial properties in key U.S. markets. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Terreno Realty Corporation of a new stock offering is a strategic move aimed at raising capital for expansion and development. The decision to issue 5 million shares, with an option for underwriters to purchase an additional 750,000, indicates an aggressive approach to funding their growth initiatives. This is a common practice for companies seeking to capitalize on their market position and invest in future growth.Investors should note that such offerings can dilute existing shares, potentially impacting the stock's price. However, if the capital is used effectively to acquire and develop properties that yield a high return on investment, the long-term benefits could outweigh the short-term dilution. The focus on industrial real estate in major coastal markets aligns with the current trend of e-commerce growth, which demands more logistics and distribution centers. The company's targeted areas, including New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area, are prime markets with limited space, suggesting a strategic choice likely to yield significant rental income. Real Estate Market Analyst Terreno Realty's emphasis on industrial properties in coastal regions reflects a broader industry trend where such assets are highly prized due to their pivotal role in supply chains. The acquisition of a portfolio of 28 buildings totaling 1.245 million square feet demonstrates a targeted investment in high-demand areas. Given the scarcity of industrial space in these markets, Terreno's strategy may lead to a strong competitive advantage.Their planned use of proceeds for acquisitions and development also suggests confidence in the industrial real estate sector's resilience and growth potential. With e-commerce driving demand for warehouse and distribution spaces, Terreno's portfolio is likely to experience favorable occupancy rates and rental price appreciation. This could signal positive future cash flows and an enhanced asset base for the company, potentially attracting investors looking for exposure to real estate without the direct risks of property management. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the offering is being conducted under an effective shelf registration statement, which provides Terreno Realty with the flexibility to sell securities over a period of time.

The absence of an offer to sell in jurisdictions where it would be unlawful until proper registration or qualification is a reminder of the meticulous legal processes involved in public offerings. 03/25/2024 - 04:02 PM BELLEVUE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Terreno Realty Corporation (NYSE: TRNO) (the “Company”), an acquirer, owner and operator of industrial real estate in six major coastal U.S. markets, announced today that it has commenced an offering of 5,000,000 shares of its common stock.

The sub notes have an effective coupon rate of 6.78% and will be listed on the NYSE under the symbol 'BEPJ'. The proceeds will be used to finance eligible investments and redeem Class A Preferred LP Units. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The issuance of $150 million in green perpetual subordinated notes by Brookfield Renewable represents a strategic move to optimize the company's capital structure. By securing a fixed effective coupon rate of 6.78% through a Canadian dollar swap, the company has effectively locked in its borrowing costs below the reset rate of its Series 15 Preferred Units. This could signal a proactive approach to debt management and a commitment to maintaining a favorable credit profile.Investors should note the diversification in Brookfield Renewable's portfolio, which includes hydroelectric, wind, solar and storage facilities, as well as investments in nuclear services and carbon capture. This diversified approach could mitigate sector-specific risks and provide a stable cash flow, potentially enhancing the attractiveness of these subordinated notes as a long-term investment.However, the subordinated nature of these notes means they rank lower in the event of liquidation, which adds a layer of risk for investors. The green label also indicates that the proceeds will be used for environmentally beneficial projects, aligning with the growing trend of sustainable investing and potentially opening up the investment to a broader market concerned with environmental impact. Sustainable Investment Analyst Brookfield Renewable's focus on green financing through its thirteenth green labelled corporate securities issuance underscores the increasing relevance of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations in investment decisions. The adherence to the 2024 Green Financing Framework suggests a structured approach to ensuring that the proceeds are allocated towards projects that have a positive environmental impact.Given the global push towards sustainability, Brookfield Renewable's investment in renewable energy assets and sustainable solutions, such as carbon capture and storage, positions the company favorably in the market. This could potentially lead to a premium on their securities due to the growing demand from ESG-focused investors.Moreover, the redemption of the Series 15 Preferred Units using the proceeds from the green subordinated notes could be seen as a reiteration of the company's commitment to sustainability, potentially strengthening investor confidence in the company's long-term vision and strategy. Energy Sector Analyst Brookfield Renewable's expansive operating capacity and development pipeline, totaling nearly 33,000 megawatts and 155,400 megawatts respectively, place it as a significant player in the renewable energy sector. The breadth of their portfolio across hydroelectric, wind, solar and storage facilities, as well as their geographic diversification, provides a competitive edge in an industry that is subject to regional policy shifts and resource availability.Investors should consider the potential growth trajectory of the renewable energy market, driven by global decarbonization efforts. Brookfield Renewable's strategic positioning and investments in emerging technologies like agricultural renewable natural gas and materials recycling could offer additional growth avenues and resilience against market volatility.However, the energy sector's susceptibility to regulatory changes and the capital-intensive nature of renewable projects must be taken into account. The company's ability to secure financing through green instruments could be important in supporting its ambitious development pipeline and maintaining its growth momentum in the renewable energy sector. 03/25/2024 - 04:01 PM All amounts in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated BROOKFIELD, News, March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Rexford Industrial Realty of a public offering of $840 million in common stock, along with a forward sale agreement, is a significant move that warrants a close examination of its financial implications. The involvement of a single long-only investor suggests a vote of confidence in the company's long-term prospects, potentially stabilizing the stock price at the time of the offering. However, the non-binding nature of the investor's interest introduces volatility, as the final amount purchased could differ substantially from the initial indication.Furthermore, the forward sale agreement with BofA Securities introduces complexity into the transaction. While it provides the company with a mechanism to potentially secure capital without immediate dilution of shareholder value, the conditions that allow the forward purchaser to not borrow shares could lead to direct sales by Rexford, altering the expected outcomes. This structure may be used to hedge against market fluctuations and lock in a sale price, but it also raises questions about the company's immediate liquidity needs and whether this signals an aggressive expansion or a defensive maneuver in anticipation of market downturns.Lastly, the concurrent offering of Exchangeable Notes adds another layer of financial engineering that could appeal to institutional investors seeking convertible debt instruments. These notes could be a strategic move to diversify the company's capital structure and provide flexibility in terms of future capital allocation. However, investors should be mindful of the potential for dilution upon conversion and the implications of the guarantees provided by Rexford on these notes. Market Research Analyst In analyzing Rexford Industrial Realty's strategic decision to raise capital through equity and debt instruments, it's essential to consider the broader market context. The industrial real estate sector has been experiencing robust growth, driven by the e-commerce boom and increased demand for distribution centers. Rexford's move to raise substantial funds suggests an anticipation of continued growth and a desire to capitalize on market opportunities, such as acquisitions or developments.However, the timing and structure of the offerings could be influenced by market conditions. If the market perceives the offerings as a way to strengthen Rexford's position in a competitive landscape, it may be seen positively. Conversely, if the timing aligns with market volatility or rising interest rates, the offerings could be interpreted as a sign of Rexford attempting to lock in financing before conditions worsen. The market's reception of this news will depend on current investor sentiment and the performance of the industrial real estate sector.Additionally, the use of a forward sale agreement indicates a nuanced approach to managing market risk and financing needs. This could be seen as a savvy move to attract long-term investors while mitigating the impact on the company's stock price in the short term. The outcome of this offering will be a key indicator of institutional investor confidence in the industrial real estate market and Rexford's strategic direction. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding Rexford Industrial Realty's public offering and forward sale agreement is a critical aspect to dissect. The offering is being conducted under an effective shelf registration statement, which allows the company to streamline the process of issuing new securities. This regulatory tool is commonly used by public companies to maintain flexibility in capital raising activities and respond quickly to favorable market conditions.Moreover, the sale of Exchangeable Notes to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A is indicative of a targeted approach to raising capital while bypassing the general public. This exemption from SEC registration requirements allows for a faster and potentially less costly transaction, albeit with restrictions on the buyer base and subsequent trading of the securities. The legal structure of these offerings, including the guarantees and the over-allotment options, is designed to provide investor protections and facilitate the underwriters' ability to manage the offering's success.It is also important to consider the legal stipulations of the forward sale agreement, which detail the conditions under which the forward purchaser can refrain from borrowing shares. These terms are vital in understanding the risk allocation between Rexford and the forward purchaser. The legal intricacies of these agreements can significantly influence the financial outcome for Rexford and its stakeholders and must be carefully scrutinized to assess the true implications of the offering. 03/25/2024 - 04:01 PM LOS ANGELES, March 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Rexford Industrial"") (NYSE: REXR), today announced that it has commenced an underwritten public offering of $840 million of its common stock, in connection with the forward sale agreement described below in which the shares are expected to be sold to an existing long-only investor based on the West Coast at a price per share equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on March 26, 2024. Because the investor's indication of interest is not a binding agreement or commitment to purchase, this investor could determine to purchase more, less or no shares in this offering or the underwriter could determine to sell more, less or no shares to this investor. BofA Securities is acting as the sole book-running manager for the offering. In connection with the offering of shares of common stock, the Company expects to enter into a forward sale agreement with BofA Securities (or its affiliate) (which the Company refers to as the ""forward purchaser""), with respect to $840 million of shares of the Company's common stock. In connection with the forward sale agreement, the forward purchaser (or its affiliate) is expected to borrow from third parties and sell to the underwriter an aggregate of $840 million of shares of the Company's common stock. However, the forward purchaser (or its affiliate) is not required to borrow such shares if, after using commercially reasonable efforts, it is unable to borrow such shares, or if borrowing costs exceed a specified threshold or if certain specified conditions have not been satisfied. If the forward purchaser or its affiliate does not deliver and sell all of the shares of the Company's common stock to be delivered and sold by it pursuant to the terms of the underwriting agreement, the Company will issue and sell directly to the underwriter the number of shares of its common stock not delivered and sold by the forward purchaser or its affiliate, and under such circumstances the number of shares of the Company's common stock underlying the forward sale agreement will be decreased by the number of shares of its common stock that the Company issues and sells. Pursuant to the terms of the forward sale agreement, and subject to its right to elect cash or net share settlement, the Company intends to issue and sell, upon physical settlement of the forward sale agreement, up to an aggregate of $840 million of common stock to the forward purchaser in exchange for cash proceeds per share equal to the applicable forward sale price, which will initially be equal to the price the underwriter agreed to pay the forward purchaser (or its affiliate) for each share, and will be subject to certain adjustments as provided in the forward sale agreement. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of its common stock by the forward purchaser (or its affiliate). The Company intends to contribute any cash proceeds that it receives upon settlement of the forward sale agreement to its operating partnership in exchange for common units.

The company plans to discuss registrational study design with regulatory agencies. Positive Positive data from Phase 1/2a studies of STK-001 for Dravet syndrome. Substantial reductions in convulsive seizure frequency observed. Clinically meaningful improvements in cognition and behavior noted. STK-001 generally well-tolerated in studies. Plans to meet with regulatory agencies for registrational study design. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent findings from Stoke Therapeutics regarding their RNA-based medicine, STK-001, show promising results for Dravet syndrome treatment. The reported median reductions of 85% in convulsive seizure frequency at 3 months and 74% at 6 months post-administration indicate a significant therapeutic benefit. This is particularly noteworthy given the refractory nature of the patient group involved, who were already on the best available anti-seizure medications. The data suggesting improvements in cognition and behavior could imply a potential shift in the treatment paradigm from symptom management to disease modification.From a research perspective, the durability of seizure reduction and cognitive benefits over 12 months suggests a sustained response to the drug, which could reduce the long-term healthcare costs associated with managing Dravet syndrome. However, it is important to monitor the safety profile, as the increased incidence of CSF protein elevation warrants further investigation to understand its long-term implications. Biotech Industry Analyst The FDA's clearance for a higher dosing regimen of STK-001 is a positive regulatory milestone for Stoke Therapeutics, potentially accelerating the path to market. The company's focus on upregulating protein expression with RNA-based medicines taps into a growing segment of the biotech industry that leverages genetic insights for targeted therapies. This approach aligns with industry trends favoring personalized medicine.For investors, the move to discuss a registrational study design with regulatory agencies is a signal that the company is progressing towards a pivotal phase of development. This can often act as a catalyst for stock valuation, assuming the market perceives the news as reducing developmental risk. The planned update in 2024 will be a critical inflection point to watch, as it may provide further insights into the drug's commercial potential and impact on Stoke's financial outlook. Neurology Specialist The reported data on STK-001's impact on Dravet syndrome is a significant development in neurology. The ability of a single medicine to not only reduce seizure frequency but also to potentially improve cognitive and behavioral functions addresses an unmet need in Dravet syndrome management. The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VINELAND-3) improvements underscore the potential for STK-001 to enhance the quality of life for patients beyond seizure control.However, as a clinician, it is important to approach these results with cautious optimism. The open-label extension study design lacks a control group, which is essential for confirming the efficacy and safety profile of the drug. The upcoming randomized, controlled registrational study will be key in validating these findings and should be closely monitored by the medical community. 03/25/2024 - 04:01 PM – Phase 1/2a End of Study Data: 70mg doses demonstrated substantial and sustained reductions in convulsive seizure frequency on top of the best available anti-seizure medicines; Median reductions of 85% (n=10) at 3 months and 74% (n=9) at 6 months after last dose – – Open Label Extension Studies: Durable reductions in seizures and clinically meaningful improvements in multiple measures of cognition and behavior were maintained over 12 months with continued dosing at 30mg and 45mg – – STK-001 generally well-tolerated – – Company to meet with regulatory agencies to discuss registrational study design with initial doses of 70mg followed by continued dosing at 45mg – – Webcast and conference call for analysts and investors at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time today – BEDFORD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Stoke Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: STOK), a biotechnology company dedicated to addressing the underlying cause of severe diseases by upregulating protein expression with RNA-based medicines, today announced landmark new data from two open-label Phase 1/2a studies and two open-label extension (OLE) studies of children and adolescents ages 2 to 18 with Dravet syndrome who were treated with STK-001. Data from these studies showed clinically meaningful effects, including substantial and durable reductions in convulsive seizure frequency and improvements in multiple measures of cognition and behavior that support the potential for disease modification. These improvements were observed among a highly refractory group of patients who were already taking the best available anti-seizure medicines. STK-001 has been generally well-tolerated in studies to date. Today, the Company also announced clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that allows patients to receive three doses of 70mg followed by continued dosing at 45mg. Based on this regulatory update and these data, the Company plans to meet with regulatory agencies to discuss a registrational study that includes initial doses of 70mg followed by continued dosing at 45mg. “The totality of these data provide compelling evidence that support the potential for STK-001 to be a disease-modifying medicine for patients with Dravet syndrome by treating the underlying cause of the disease, rather than just the symptoms,” said Edward M. Kaye, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Stoke Therapeutics. “STK-001 is the first medicine in development to demonstrate substantial and durable reductions in seizure frequency and improvements in multiple measures of cognition and behavior. These effects were observed in patients who were already taking the best available anti-seizure medicines, which confirms our highly differentiated mechanism of action and approach to treating this disease. We look forward to meeting with regulatory agencies to discuss our plans for a randomized, controlled registrational study and to providing an update coming out of those discussions later in 2024.” “For decades, the primary goal of treating Dravet syndrome has been to control the frequency and severity of seizures, but, as we can now see from natural history data, many patients still experience high rates of seizure frequency and fall further and further behind in their neurodevelopment,” said Joseph Sullivan, M.D., FAES, Professor of Neurology and Pediatrics and Director of the Pediatric Epilepsy Center of Excellence at the University of California San Francisco, and a prominent researcher in Dravet syndrome. “A 50% reduction in seizures is an important measure of clinical efficacy, so an 80% reduction on top of any benefit patients may already be getting from their baseline anti-seizure regimen is profound. The further evidence of improvements in skills like communication, behavior, socialization and movement distinguish this approach from anything we have seen to date and mark our entry into a new era in the treatment of Dravet syndrome.” Phase 1/2a Study Results: Substantial and Sustained Reductions in Convulsive Seizure Frequency The Phase 1/2a studies were multi-center and included children and adolescents who have an established diagnosis of Dravet syndrome. Patients enrolled in these studies were highly refractory to treatment and taking the best available anti-seizure medicines: 85% of patients were taking at least three and 54% were taking at least four medicines to control seizures. Half the patients in the studies were taking concomitant fenfluramine. New data from a combined analysis of 19 clinically evaluable patients who were treated with one, two or three doses of 70mg demonstrated substantial reductions in convulsive seizure frequency compared to baseline at 3 months and at 6 months after the last dose, one of several secondary endpoints in each study. Observed Reductions in Convulsive Seizure Frequency Among Patients Treated with 70mg Doses of STK-001 in the Phase 1/2a Studies Median % Reduction from Baseline in Convulsive Seizure Frequency 70mg (1 dose, n=8) 70mg (2 or 3 doses, n=11) At 3 Months After Last Dose 43% (n=8) 85% (n=10†) At 6 Months After Last Dose 57% (n=7*) 74% (n=9†) *Seizure data excluded from month 5-6 for 1 patient because >50% seizure diary was missing †Seizure data excluded for 2 patients (1 patient prior to 3m after last dose, 1 prior to 6m after last dose) following a change in background anti-seizure medicines Open Label Extension Studies: Durable reductions in seizures and clinically meaningful improvements in multiple measures of cognition and behavior over 12 months with continued dosing at 30mg and 45mg Eligible patients who completed treatment in the Phase 1/2a studies continued treatment with STK-001 in one of two OLEs. At the time of the analysis, 92% (68/74) of eligible patients had enrolled in the OLEs and 84% (57/68) remained in the studies. Durable reductions in convulsive seizure frequency were observed throughout the course of treatment. This analysis only included patients who received >30mg of STK-001 in the Phase 1/2a studies and then continued treatment with STK-001 (30mg or 45mg) every four months in the OLEs. Clinically meaningful improvements from baseline through 12 months were observed in multiple measures of cognition and behavior, including multiple sub-domains of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VINELAND-3). These improvements are in stark contrast to recent natural history study data that showed that, on average, patients with Dravet syndrome experienced no meaningful improvement in convulsive seizure frequency and exhibited widening gaps in cognition and behavior compared to neurotypical peers, despite treatment with the best available anti-seizure medicines. Key Safety Findings At the time of the analyses, 81 patients had been treated with STK-001. Safety findings are summarized below. STK-001 was generally well-tolerated across the Phase 1/2a and OLE studies. In the Phase 1/2a studies: 30% (24/81) of patients experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) that was related to study drug. The most common were CSF protein elevations and procedural vomiting; and 22% (18/81) of patients had a treatment-emergent serious adverse event. These events were assessed as unrelated to study drug except for the previously reported case of one patient who experienced Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs). A greater incidence of CSF protein elevation was observed in the OLEs. 74% (50/68) of patients in the OLEs had at least 1 CSF protein value >50 mg/dL. No clinical manifestations have been observed in these patients. Across the studies, one patient discontinued treatment due to study drug. As previously reported, this patient discontinued treatment in the OLE due to elevated CSF protein.

About Dravet Syndrome Dravet syndrome is a severe and progressive genetic epilepsy characterized by frequent, prolonged and refractory seizures, beginning within the first year of life. Dravet syndrome is difficult to treat and has a poor long-term prognosis. Complications of the disease often contribute to a poor quality of life for patients and their caregivers. The effects of the disease go beyond seizures and often include intellectual disability, developmental delays, movement and balance issues, language and speech disturbances, growth defects, sleep abnormalities, disruptions of the autonomic nervous system and mood disorders. The disease is classified as a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy due to the developmental delays and cognitive impairment associated with the disease. Compared with the general epilepsy population, people living with Dravet syndrome have a higher risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, or SUDEP. There are no approved disease-modifying therapies for people living with Dravet syndrome. One out of 16,000 babies are born with Dravet syndrome, which is not concentrated in a particular geographic area or ethnic group. About STK-001 STK-001 is an investigational new medicine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome currently being evaluated in ongoing clinical trials. Stoke believes that STK-001, a proprietary antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), has the potential to be the first disease-modifying therapy to address the genetic cause of Dravet syndrome. STK-001 is designed to upregulate NaV1.1 protein expression by leveraging the non-mutant (wild-type) copy of the SCN1A gene to restore physiological NaV1.1 levels, thereby reducing both occurrence of seizures and significant non-seizure comorbidities. STK-001 has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA and the EMA, and rare pediatric disease designation by the FDA as a potential new treatment for Dravet syndrome. About the U.S. Studies: MONARCH (Phase 1/2a) and SWALLOWTAIL (OLE) The MONARCH study was a Phase 1/2a open-label study of children and adolescents ages 2 to 18 who have an established diagnosis of Dravet syndrome and have evidence of a genetic mutation in the SCN1A gene. The primary objectives for the study were to assess the safety and tolerability of STK-001, as well as to determine the pharmacokinetics in plasma and exposure in cerebrospinal fluid. A secondary objective was to assess the efficacy as an adjunctive antiepileptic treatment with respect to the percentage change from baseline in convulsive seizure frequency. Following completion of MONARCH, patients who met study entry criteria were eligible to continue treatment in SWALLOWTAIL, an open-label extension (OLE) study designed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of repeat doses of STK-001. The study is also evaluating the long-term effects of STK-001 on convulsive seizure frequency and on behavior, cognition and overall quality of life. Dosing in SWALLOWTAIL is ongoing. About the UK Studies: ADMIRAL (Phase 1/2a) and LONGWING (OLE) The ADMIRAL study was a Phase 1/2a open-label study of children and adolescents ages 2 to <18 who have an established diagnosis of Dravet syndrome and have evidence of a genetic mutation in the SCN1A gene. The primary objectives for the study were to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of STK-001, as well as to determine the pharmacokinetics in plasma and exposure in cerebrospinal fluid. A secondary objective was to assess the effect of multiple doses of STK-001 as an adjunctive antiepileptic treatment with respect to the percentage change from baseline in convulsive seizure frequency. Overall clinical status and quality of life were secondary endpoints of ADMIRAL. Following completion of ADMIRAL, patients who met study entry criteria were eligible to continue treatment in LONGWING, an open-label extension (OLE) study designed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of repeat doses of STK-001. The study is also evaluating the long-term effects of STK-001 on convulsive seizure frequency and on behavior, cognition and overall quality of life. Dosing in LONGWING is ongoing. About the BUTTERFLY Observational Study The BUTTERFLY study was a multicenter, longitudinal, prospective, observational study of children and adolescents ages 2 to 18 who have been diagnosed with Dravet syndrome as a result of an SCN1A gene mutation. This study was designed to evaluate neurodevelopmental status and change from baseline to 24 months. Secondary and exploratory endpoints in the study evaluated changes in other disease measures, including seizures and additional non-seizure comorbidities. No investigational medications or other treatments were provided. Participants continued to receive their usual care, including anti-seizure medications, and were observed for up to two years. The study was conducted at approximately 20 sites in the United States. Two-year results were presented at the American Epilepsy Society in December 2023 and showed that, on average, patients experienced no meaningful improvement in convulsive seizure frequency and exhibited widening gaps in cognition and behavior compared to neurotypical peers, despite treatment with the best available anti-seizure medicines. About Stoke Therapeutics Stoke Therapeutics (Nasdaq: STOK), is a biotechnology company dedicated to addressing the underlying cause of severe diseases by upregulating protein expression with RNA-based medicines. Using Stoke’s proprietary TANGO (Targeted Augmentation of Nuclear Gene Output) approach, Stoke is developing antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to selectively restore protein levels. Stoke’s first compound, STK-001, is in clinical testing for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, a severe and progressive genetic epilepsy. Dravet syndrome is one of many diseases caused by a haploinsufficiency, in which a loss of ~50% of normal protein levels leads to disease. Stoke is pursuing the development of STK-002 for the treatment of autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA), the most common inherited optic nerve disorder. Stoke’s initial focus is haploinsufficiencies and diseases of the central nervous system and the eye, although proof of concept has been demonstrated in other organs, tissues, and systems, supporting its belief in the broad potential for its proprietary approach. Stoke is headquartered in Bedford, Massachusetts with offices in Cambridge, Massachusetts. For more information, visit https://www.stoketherapeutics.com/.

The notes will be guaranteed by Rexford Industrial and used for acquisitions, development activities, and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc. regarding the private offering of exchangeable senior notes is a strategic move to raise capital. The decision to issue $500 million each in 2027 and 2029 notes, with a possible over-allotment option, indicates a proactive approach to secure funding for future acquisitions and development projects. This move is likely to appeal to institutional investors seeking diversification in real estate assets, given the senior and unsecured nature of the notes. However, the non-redeemable feature of the 2027 notes until maturity could make them less attractive in a rising interest rate environment, as investors would lack the flexibility to exit the investment before maturity.Additionally, the conditional redeemability of the 2029 notes provides the company with financial flexibility, while offering potential upside to investors should the company's stock price perform well. However, it's important to consider the impact of the offering on the company's debt profile and the potential dilution of existing shareholders if the notes are exchanged for common stock. Investors should weigh these factors against the company's growth prospects and the performance of the industrial real estate market. Legal Expert The offering of exchangeable senior notes by Rexford Industrial is subject to Rule 144A, which allows for the sale of securities to qualified institutional buyers without the need for public registration. This exemption streamlines the capital-raising process for the issuer but limits the potential buyer pool. The guarantee by Rexford Industrial provides additional security for the note holders, potentially increasing the attractiveness of the notes.However, the lack of a public offering means less liquidity for investors and the resale limitations imposed by the Securities Act could pose challenges. The registration rights agreement is a critical document that will define the rights of investors to resell their shares, but limitations within this agreement could impact the liquidity and value of these shares. It's essential for investors to understand the legal implications and the risks associated with the resale of the exchanged shares of common stock. Market Research Analyst The industrial real estate sector, where Rexford Industrial operates, has been experiencing growth due to increased demand for logistics and distribution centers, driven by e-commerce expansion. The use of proceeds from the note offerings for acquisitions and development activities aligns with the company's growth strategy in this sector. This decision could position Rexford Industrial favorably within the market, provided the funds are deployed effectively in high-value projects.However, market conditions, including interest rates and real estate market cycles, will play a significant role in the success of these investments. Investors should monitor the company's selection of acquisitions and development projects to ensure alignment with high-growth potential areas. The company's ability to execute its strategy effectively and the performance of its investments will be key factors influencing investor sentiment and the stock's performance in the long term. 03/25/2024 - 04:01 PM LOS ANGELES, March 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc.

The company plans to initiate multiple trials in 2024 and expand its pipeline with new ADCs, securing collaborations for future growth. Positive Strong cash position of $333.7 million and investments in Vaxcyte common stock valued at $41.9 million provide a projected cash runway into the second half of 2025. Positive data presented at ASH 2023 showed compelling anti-leukemic activity of luvelta in pediatric patients with CBF/GLIS AML. Initiation of REFRαME-O1 trial for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients and plans for REFRαME-P1 trial for pediatric patients with CBF/GLIS AML in 2024. Expansion of pipeline with STRO-003 and STRO-004 ADCs, seeking IND submissions in 2024 and 2025, respectively. Collaboration with Vaxcyte for manufacturing rights agreement and potential revenue of up to $135 million based on milestones. Promotion of Jane Chung to President and COO to drive operational excellence and business success at Sutro. Negative - Current market conditions pose a challenging financing environment for Sutro, prompting evaluation of programs and spending. - Total operating expenses for 2023 were $243.0 million, with significant research and development expenses of $180.4 million. - Unrealized gain of $9.9 million from the increase in value of Vaxcyte common stock contributed to non-operating income in 2023. Financial Analyst The financial results presented by Sutro Biopharma are indicative of a company in a robust position with a solid cash reserve and a sizeable non-operating gain from its Vaxcyte common stock investment. The increase in revenue from $67.8 million in the previous year to $153.7 million is noteworthy, reflecting successful monetization of collaborations and licensing agreements, particularly the Vaxcyte manufacturing rights agreement. The projected cash runway into the second half of 2025 suggests the company has sufficient funds to sustain its operations and invest in pipeline development without immediate need for additional financing, which is particularly advantageous given the current challenging financing environment.However, the increase in operating expenses to $243.0 million, up from $196.7 million, should be monitored as it may impact future profitability. The company's strategy to evaluate programs and spending in light of market conditions is a prudent approach to ensure sustainability. The unrealized gain from Vaxcyte common stock is a positive, but it's important to note that such non-operating gains are subject to market fluctuations and are not indicative of operational performance. Medical Research Analyst Sutro Biopharma's focus on addressing unmet needs in multiple FolRα-expressing cancers through its ADC franchise is a strategic move in oncology therapeutics. The anti-leukemic activity data presented for luveltamab tazevibulin (luvelta) at ASH 2023, particularly the high complete remission rates in pediatric patients, is promising. Such data can be influential in obtaining regulatory approvals and can drive future revenue through sales or partnerships.The initiation of the REFRαME-O1 and REFRαME-P1 trials for PROC and pediatric CBF/GLIS AML, respectively, represents significant progress in the clinical pipeline. The choice to pursue a registration-directed study indicates confidence in the drug's efficacy and a clear path toward commercialization. The IND submissions planned for STRO-003 and STRO-004 expand the pipeline's potential and diversify the company's portfolio, which is important for long-term growth.Collaborations and licensing agreements, such as the manufacturing rights agreement with Vaxcyte, demonstrate Sutro's ability to leverage its proprietary cell-free platform. This not only provides non-dilutive capital but also validates the technology and could lead to more partnership opportunities. Market Research Analyst The oncology drug development sector is highly competitive, with significant rewards for companies that bring innovative treatments to market. Sutro Biopharma's investment in luveltamab tazevibulin positions the company within a niche segment of cancer therapy targeting FolRα-expressing cancers. The market potential for ADCs is growing and Sutro's advancements could capture a significant share if clinical outcomes are positive and lead to regulatory approvals.Investor confidence may be bolstered by the company's strong cash position and the strategic planning of cash runway into 2025. However, investor sentiment can also be affected by the high costs associated with the development of novel therapeutics. Sutro's ability to manage these costs while advancing its clinical programs will be a key factor in sustaining investor interest.Additionally, the company's collaborations with industry partners such as Vaxcyte, Astellas and Merck are indicative of Sutro's strategic positioning and potential for future revenue streams. The success of these partnerships and the advancement of the pipeline will be critical in shaping the company's market valuation and attractiveness to potential investors. 03/25/2024 - 04:30 PM - Sutro highlighted luveltamab tazevibulin (luvelta) in a January 2024 investor webcast, describing the broad opportunity to address unmet needs in multiple FolRα-expressing cancers - - Compelling anti-leukemic activity of luvelta in pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory CBF2AT3-GLIS2 AML treated under Compassionate Use shown in data presented at ASH 2023 - - Jane Chung promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer in November 2023 - - As of year-end 2023, Sutro had cash and investments of $333.7 million and shares of Vaxcyte common stock valued at $41.9 million, which together provide a projected cash runway into the second half of 2025 - SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sutro Biopharma, Inc. (Sutro or the Company) (NASDAQ: STRO), a clinical-stage oncology company pioneering site-specific and novel-format antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), today reported its financial results for the full year 2023, its recent business highlights, and a preview of select anticipated milestones. “The year 2023 was pivotal for Sutro, with the initiation of REFRαME-O1, our registration-directed study of luvelta for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) patients, further validating our next-generation ADC capabilities. In addition, we advanced our earlier stage programs, strengthened our management team, and bolstered our already strong cash position with additional non-dilutive capital,” said Bill Newell, Sutro’s Chief Executive Officer. “We look forward to continuing the momentum in 2024, with the initiation of a second registration-directed trial with luvelta, REFRαME-P1, for pediatric patients with CBF/GLIS AML, and two additional planned INDs. I am delighted with the strides we are taking towards meaningfully impacting the lives of cancer patients in need.” Recent Business Highlights and Select Anticipated Milestones STRO-002, International Nonproprietary Name, “luveltamab tazevibulin,” abbreviated as “luvelta,” FolRα-Targeting ADC Franchise: In January 2024, Sutro hosted an investor webcast highlighting luvelta’s broad opportunity to address unmet needs in several FolRα-expressing cancers, including platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC), endometrial cancer, CBFA2T3::GLIS2 (CBF/GLIS; RAM phenotype) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The registration-directed trial, REFRαME-O1, for treatment of PROC is enrolling, with an anticipated ~140 sites in ~20 countries to be opened by the end of 2024. Enrollment of Part 1 of the trial is expected to be completed in the first half of 2024.In December 2023, data demonstrating anti-leukemic activity with luvelta, either as a single agent or in combination, in pediatric patients with CBF/GLIS AML, were presented at the 65th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition (ASH 2023), including complete remission in 42% of patients with CBF/GLIS AML with ≥5% blasts and in 75% of pediatric patients with CBF/GLIS AML with <5% blasts.Enrollment of REFRαME-P1, a registration-enabling trial for pediatric patients with CBF/GLIS AML, is expected to be initiated in the second half of 2024.An Investigational New Drug (IND) application submission is planned for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the first half of 2024.Continued clinical development is planned in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of ovarian cancer and in endometrial cancer, as resources permit. Additional Pipeline Development and Collaboration Updates: Sutro plans to submit an IND for STRO-003, a ROR1-targeting ADC, in 2024.Sutro plans to submit an IND for STRO-004, a tissue factor-targeting ADC, in 2025.Sutro continues to seek to maximize the value of its proprietary cell-free platform by working with partners on programs in multiple disease spaces and geographies and has generated from collaborators an aggregate of approximately $854 million in payments through December 31, 2023, including equity investments.In November 2023, Vaxcyte exercised its option to enter into a manufacturing rights agreement with Sutro to obtain control over the development and manufacture of cell-free extract for use under its license agreement with Sutro, including for Vaxcyte’s pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) franchise, which includes VAX-24 and VAX-31. Upon exercising the option, Vaxcyte paid Sutro $50 million and is obligated to pay Sutro an additional $25 million within six months. Upon the occurrence of certain regulatory milestones, Vaxcyte would be obligated to pay Sutro up to an additional $60 million. Corporate Updates: Sutro continues to build a world-class leadership team through the promotion of Jane Chung to President and Chief Operating Officer, a newly created role in which she will be responsible for driving operational excellence, strategic growth, and overall business success at Sutro. Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesAs of December 31, 2023, Sutro had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $333.7 million, as compared to $321.1 million as of September 30, 2023, and approximately 0.7 million shares of Vaxcyte common stock with a fair value of $41.9 million, which together provide a projected cash runway into the second half of 2025, based on current business plans and assumptions. Current market conditions provide a challenging financing environment. In this context, Sutro is continuing its process of evaluating its programs and spending. Unrealized Gain from Increase in Value of Vaxcyte Common Stock The non-operating, unrealized gain of $9.9 million for the year 2023 was due to the increase since December 31, 2022 in the estimated fair value of Sutro’s holdings of Vaxcyte common stock. Vaxcyte common stock held by Sutro will be remeasured at fair value based on the closing price of Vaxcyte’s common stock on the last trading day of each reporting period, with any non-operating, unrealized gains and losses recorded in Sutro’s statements of operations. Revenue Revenue was $153.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $67.8 million for the same period in 2022, with the 2023 amount related principally to the Vaxcyte manufacturing rights agreement option exercise, Astellas and Merck collaborations, and the recognition of a contingent payment from Tasly. Future collaboration and license revenue under existing agreements, and from any additional collaboration and license partners, will fluctuate as a result of the amount and timing of revenue recognition of upfront, milestones, and other agreement payments.

ESAB Corporation Announces Upsizing and Pricing of its 6.25% Senior Notes due 2029,2024-03-25T21:58:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"ESAB  announced the pricing of $700 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Senior Notes due 2029, increasing from the initial $600 million.

The proceeds will repay borrowings under its senior term loan A-3 facility, with the rest for general corporate purposes. The offering is expected to close on April 9, 2024. The Notes are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and may only be offered to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A or certain persons outside the United States under Regulation S. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision by ESAB Corporation to increase the aggregate principal amount of its Senior Notes offering from $600 million to $700 million is a significant financial move. This adjustment indicates a robust demand for the company's debt instruments, which could be interpreted as a positive signal by the market about the company's creditworthiness and investor confidence. The 6.25% interest rate on the Senior Notes, which are due in 2029, is relatively high, suggesting that investors are being compensated for taking on a higher risk associated with the company's long-term debt.Investors and analysts will be evaluating the impact of this debt issuance on ESAB's leverage ratios and interest coverage metrics. The use of proceeds to repay existing debt under its senior term loan A-3 facility may improve the company's debt maturity profile and potentially lower its overall cost of capital. However, the increment in the principal amount could also imply a higher interest expense going forward, which would need to be covered by the company's operational cash flows. It's critical to assess whether the company's financial performance can sustain this additional debt without compromising its financial stability. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding the offering of the Senior Notes by ESAB is notable for its reliance on exemptions from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The use of Rule 144A allows ESAB to target qualified institutional buyers, a group that typically has the expertise and financial capability to invest in securities not registered with the SEC. Meanwhile, Regulation S facilitates the sale of these securities outside the United States.It's essential for potential investors to understand the implications of these securities not being registered under the Securities Act. The lack of registration restricts the resale of the Notes, which could impact their liquidity and, consequently, their market value. Furthermore, the guarantees by certain domestic subsidiaries serve as an additional layer of security for the investors, potentially making the Notes more attractive despite the restrictions on their sale. Market Research Analyst In the context of the broader market, ESAB's move to issue $700 million in Senior Notes may reflect underlying industry trends or the company's strategic initiatives. The industrial compounding sector often requires significant capital for operations and expansion and companies frequently resort to the debt markets for funding. The decision to allocate the remainder of the proceeds for general corporate purposes could indicate planned investments in growth or innovation, which may be a response to competitive pressures or opportunities identified by the company's management.Given the current economic climate, characterized by rising interest rates, the fixed rate of 6.25% could be advantageous if rates continue to climb. However, it could also be a burden if rates stabilize or decrease. This issuance could affect the company's stock performance, depending on how investors perceive the use of debt proceeds and the company's ability to manage its increased debt load while pursuing profitable growth. 03/25/2024 - 05:58 PM NORTH BETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ESAB Corporation (“ESAB” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ESAB), a focused premier industrial compounder, announced today the pricing of its previously announced offering of $700 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Notes”).

(MRKR) reports positive results in lymphoma program with sustained complete response, secures $2 million NIH funding for AML program, receives ODD from EMA for AML treatment, appoints new leadership, and executes non-dilutive agreement with Cell Ready to reduce expenses and extend runway. Positive Successful Phase 1 lymphoma study with sustained complete response in first patient treated with MT-601 post CAR T relapse Secured $2 million non-dilutive funding from NIH to support AML program Received Orphan Drug Designation from EMA for MT-401 in AML treatment Appointed Juan Vera, M.D. as President and CEO, and Monic Stuart, M.D., MPH as CMO Executed non-dilutive agreement with Cell Ready for reduced overhead expenses and extended runway Strategic focus on MT-601 in lymphoma patients who failed or are ineligible for CAR T therapy Negative None. Oncology Doctor The recent advancements in T cell-based immunotherapies by Marker Therapeutics, particularly MT-601 (Neldaleucel), present a significant step forward in treating lymphoma patients who have relapsed after CAR T therapy. The observed sustained complete response in a patient is noteworthy, as it suggests potential for a durable treatment option in a patient cohort with limited alternatives. The focus on a multi-antigen targeting approach could indeed offer a differentiated safety and cost profile compared to existing gene-modified therapies.Moreover, the strategic move to secure non-dilutive funding from the NIH for the MT-401 (Zedenoleucel) program in AML patients is a prudent step that could accelerate the development of this 'Off-the-Shelf' therapy. The ability to manufacture from healthy donors may reduce the treatment initiation time, which is important for AML patients, especially those with MRD where disease progression can be rapid.The Orphan Drug Designation from the EMA for MT-401 indicates recognition of the therapy's potential and could facilitate a more streamlined development and approval process in the European market. Financial Analyst Marker Therapeutics' recent corporate developments have significant financial implications. The preliminary success of MT-601 in a clinical study may enhance investor confidence and could potentially lead to an increase in the company's market valuation. The non-dilutive funding from the NIH is a positive indicator of the company's ability to attract capital without diluting shareholder value, which is a favorable sign for current investors.The agreement with Cell Ready, resulting in a cash influx of approximately $19 million, is a strategic maneuver that strengthens the company's balance sheet and extends its financial runway into Q4 2025. This extension is critical for a clinical-stage company that relies on milestones to progress through expensive trial phases. The focus on operational efficiency through the reduction of overhead expenses aligns with prudent financial management practices and could lead to improved net margins over time.The Orphan Drug Designation could also provide financial benefits such as tax credits, grant funding and market exclusivity upon approval, which would be a substantial advantage in the competitive oncology market. Market Research Analyst Marker Therapeutics' strategic prioritization of its clinical pipeline, particularly with MT-601 for lymphoma, appears to be a calculated decision to capture a niche market segment. By targeting patients who have failed or are ineligible for CAR T therapy, the company is positioning itself in an area with less competition and a clear unmet need. This could translate to a strong market uptake if MT-601 is approved, given the lack of alternatives for this patient population.The receipt of Orphan Drug Designation by the EMA for MT-401 in AML treatment further suggests that the company is not only focusing on the U.S. market but is also eyeing expansion into Europe. This bodes well for the company's long-term growth prospects and diversification of revenue sources.The collaboration with Cell Ready could potentially enhance production efficiencies and reduce costs, which is vital for the scalability of the treatments. This is particularly important in the immuno-oncology space where manufacturing costs can be a barrier to widespread adoption. 03/25/2024 - 05:45 PM Lead program in patients with lymphoma demonstrated preliminary safety and efficacy results with sustained complete response in first study participant treated with MT-601 (Neldaleucel) following CAR T relapse Secured non-dilutive funding of $2 million from National Institute of Health (NIH) to support clinical program for treatment of patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Received Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) from European Medicines Agency (EMA) for multiTAA-specific T cell product candidate MT-401 (Zedenoleucel) for the treatment of patients with AML Implemented leadership transition resulting in appointments of Juan Vera, M.D. as President and Chief Executive Officer and Monic Stuart, M.D., MPH as Chief Medical Officer Executed comprehensive non-dilutive agreement with Cell Ready™ effecting a significant reduction in overhead expenses and extending Marker’s runway into the fourth quarter of 2025 Strategic prioritization of clinical pipeline with focus on MT-601 (Neldaleucel) in patients with lymphoma HOUSTON, March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Marker Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: MRKR), a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company focusing on developing next-generation T cell-based immunotherapies for the treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumors, today reported recent corporate developments and financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023. “The progress achieved in 2023 we believe establishes a robust foundation for Marker and sets the stage for continued advancement in our clinical programs and business operations in the upcoming year,” commented Juan Vera, M.D. President and Chief Executive Officer of Marker Therapeutics. “A pinnacle of last year's success was the Phase 1 lymphoma study milestone, where we observed a sustained complete response in our first study participant treated with MT-601 following CAR T relapse. This patient relapsed within 90 days of CAR T therapy but has remained in a complete remission for at least six months after MT-601 treatment, indicating that MT-601 has superior durability in this study participant. The promising clinical and non-clinical observations from our lymphoma study reinforced our strategic decision, made public this January, to prioritize the development of MT-601 in patients with lymphoma who have failed or are ineligible for CAR T therapy. Focusing on this unique niche of patients and by targeting multiple antigens, our approach differs significantly from competitors, and we believe that MT-601 could address an unmet medical need in this patient population with a better safety profile and at lower costs when compared to gene-modified cell therapy approaches.” Further bolstering Marker’s position is the award of $2 million in non-dilutive funding from the NIH last year, which is instrumental in supporting the advancement of the Company’s MT-401 “Off-the-Shelf” (MT-401-OTS) program in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Dr. Vera added, “This award is expected to enable us to proceed with the OTS program without affecting our ongoing study for patients with lymphoma. Decreasing time to treatment is critical for rapidly progressing cancers, such as patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) in AML.” Utilizing an OTS product manufactured from healthy donors will help to bypass the treatment delay that is associated with patient-specific manufacture and should shorten the time until the product is made available to patients, while reducing manufacturing costs. Additionally, receiving Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) substantiates the potential impact of MT-401 in patients with AML and presents an opportunity to develop the therapy on an expedited basis. Marker also executed a comprehensive non-dilutive agreement with Cell Ready which included a sale of select cell manufacturing assets from Marker for approximately $19 million in cash. This major transaction, which we expect will enable a reduction of overhead expenses of about $11 million annually, not only improves our financial health but, we believe, also positions us uniquely in the cell therapy industry — a sector where such significant non-dilutive funding and operational savings are remarkably rare. This strategic foresight, together with the drawdowns available from our grant funds, should extend the cash runway into the fourth quarter of 2025. “These accomplishments underline our commitment to driving scientific innovation, our vision in making major impact with our novel multiTAA technology for patients in need, and our emphasis on cash preservation and operational excellence. As we have pivoted into 2024, we remain poised to advance our clinical endeavors with the goal of introducing transformative therapies to the market and improving patient outcomes,” concluded Dr. Vera. 2023 PROGRAM UPDATES & OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS MT-601 (Lymphoma) Non-Clinical Data on MT-601 Marker developed a long-term in vitro killing assay 1) to investigate resistance mechanisms after CAR T cell treatment, and 2) to analyze if MT-601 (targeting 6 TAAs) can eliminate CAR-resistant lymphoma cells.Anti-CD19 CAR T cell treatment killed 98% of lymphoma cells in vitro. However, after three weeks, CD19-negative tumor cells started to grow. Further anti-CD19 CAR T cell treatments were ineffective as these tumor cells lack target antigen (CD19) expression (Pre-Clinical Data in Lymphoma, May 31, 2023).Treatment with MT-601 demonstrated long-term growth inhibition (over three weeks) of CAR-resistant lymphoma cells, highlighting that MT-601 has the potential to effectively treat CD19 CAR-resistant tumors (Press Release, May 31, 2023). Clinical Highlights Phase 1 multicenter APOLLO trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT05798897), investigating MT-601 in patients with lymphoma who relapsed or are ineligible for anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapies, was selected as lead program based on promising preliminary clinical results and non-clinical proof-of-concept data.The first study participant, a 57-year-old female with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), was enrolled in the Phase 1 dose escalation stage of the trial after failing 4 prior lines of therapy, including relapsing within 90 days of anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy. Without prior lymphodepletion, the participant was treated with MT-601. In December 2023, the Company announced that the study participant tolerated initial dose level well and had maintained a complete response to therapy six months after initial treatment with MT-601 (Press Release, December 11, 2023).The Company is enrolling additional patients in the Phase 1 APOLLO trial and expects to report further data in the first half of 2024.MT-601 designated non-proprietary name “Neldaleucel” by United States Adopted Name (USAN) Counsel and International Nonproprietary Names (INN) Expert Committee. MT-601 (Pancreatic) Investigational New Drug (IND) application cleared by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for multicenter Phase 1 trial of MT-601 in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer in combination with front-line chemotherapy.Clinical advancement will be pending additional financial support from non-dilutive grant activities. MT-401-OTS (Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome) U.S. FDA has granted an Investigational New Drug (IND) to investigate MT-401 as an “Off-the-Shelf” (MT-401-OTS) product in patients with AML or Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). MT-401-OTS is manufactured from healthy donors and a cellular inventory has been established with ongoing efforts to expand.Marker announced non-clinical proof-of-concept data supporting the clinical benefits of MT-401-OTS in AML.The Company has secured $2M in non-dilutive funding from the NIH Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. These funds will support the clinical investigation of MT-401-OTS in patients with AML without affecting the ongoing Phase 1 APOLLO study in patients with lymphoma.Granted ODD from the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products of the EMA for the treatment of patients with AML in 2023. ODD was received from the U.S. FDA in 2020.Clinical program initiation of MT-401-OTS anticipated for the second half of 2024. 2023 CORPORATE HIGHLIGHTS Announced clinical pipeline prioritization in January 2024 to strategically focus on MT-601 in patients with lymphoma. This announcement also included program updates that highlighted the potential of the Company’s MT-401-OTS program for AML.Appointed Juan Vera, M.D., as President and Chief Executive Officer and Monic Stuart, M.D., MPH, as Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Vera was also appointed the Company’s Principal Financial and Accounting Officer.On June 26, 2023, Marker completed a non-dilutive transaction with Cell Ready, under which Cell Ready purchased certain cell manufacturing assets from Marker for approximately $19 million in cash. On February 22, 2024, Marker entered into a Master Services Agreement for Product Supply with Cell Ready. Under this agreement, Cell Ready will perform a wide variety of services for Marker, including research and development, and manufacturing in support of Marker’s clinical trials.Terminated common stock purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital.Extended financial runway into the fourth quarter of 2025. FISCAL YEAR 2023 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Cash Position and Guidance: At December 31, 2023, Marker had cash and cash equivalents of $15.1 million. The Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents will fund its operating expenses into the fourth quarter of 2025, inclusive of available drawdowns from grant funds. R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

About multiTAA-specific T cells The multi-tumor associated antigen (multiTAA)-specific T cell platform is a novel, non-genetically modified cell therapy approach that selectively expands tumor-specific T cells from a patient's/donor’s blood capable of recognizing a broad range of tumor antigens. Since multiTAA-specific T cells are not genetically engineered, Marker believes that its product candidates will be easier and less expensive to manufacture, with reduced toxicities, compared to current engineered CAR-T and TCR-based approaches, and may provide patients with meaningful clinical benefits. As a result, Marker believes that its portfolio of T cell therapies has a compelling product profile, as compared to current gene-modified CAR-T and TCR-based therapies. About Marker Therapeutics, Inc. Marker Therapeutics, Inc. is a Houston, TX-based clinical-stage immuno-oncology company specializing in the development of next-generation T cell-based immunotherapies for the treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Clinical trials that enrolled more than 200 patients across various hematological and solid tumor indications showed that the Company’s autologous and allogeneic multiTAA-specific T cell products were well tolerated and demonstrated durable clinical responses. Marker’s goal is to introduce novel T cell therapies to the market and improve patient outcomes.

Reports Fiscal Year 2023 Results and Announces Investor Call Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary M-tron Industries, Inc. (MPTI) reported strong financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, with total revenues of $41.2 million, a 29.3% increase from the previous year. Consolidated gross margin improved to 40.7%, and diluted net income per share rose to $1.28. Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 was $7.7 million, showcasing significant growth. The company's CEO highlighted the successful first year as a public company and emphasized a focus on improving results and maintaining margins. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The significant revenue growth of M-tron Industries, highlighted by a 29.3% increase year-over-year, indicates robust sales performance, particularly in the aerospace and defense sectors. This expansion is a positive signal to investors, reflecting the company's ability to capitalize on market opportunities and possibly gain market share. The improvement in gross margin to 40.7% suggests effective cost management and possibly a favorable shift in product mix, which is a key indicator of financial health and operational efficiency. The reported order backlog, although only marginally increased, provides visibility into future revenues, supporting a stable outlook for the company's financial performance.Furthermore, the diluted net income per share more than doubled from the previous year, which is a strong indicator of profitability and may influence investor sentiment positively. Adjusted EBITDA's significant increase is also noteworthy, as it is often used by investors to evaluate a company's operating performance and cash flow potential, excluding non-recurring items and stock-based compensation, which are considered less indicative of ongoing operations. Market Research Analyst M-tronPTI's strategic focus on high-reliability products for harsh environments is a deliberate move to differentiate itself in the market. The emphasis on advanced materials science and integrated microwave assemblies caters to specialized industry needs, which can command higher margins and reduce competition. The consistent revenue increase quarter-over-quarter throughout 2024 underscores the company's market traction and could suggest that M-tronPTI is successfully executing its growth strategy.The one-time stock option grant to employees below the executive level is a strategic move that could enhance employee retention and align interests with shareholders. This incentive might contribute to improved productivity and innovation, ultimately benefiting the company's long-term performance. However, it is important to monitor how these expenses impact the bottom line and whether the benefits of such programs outweigh the costs in the long run. Legal Expert The separation of MtronPTI from The LGL Group and its transition to an independent, publicly traded entity is a significant corporate restructuring event. It's important to consider the legal and financial implications of such a move, including the potential for increased scrutiny from regulators and shareholders. The company's ability to navigate this transition while posting strong financial results is a testament to its management's strategic planning and execution capabilities.Investors should pay attention to any material changes in reporting and compliance costs associated with being a standalone public company. The incremental direct costs, although not directly comparable to the previous year, should be closely monitored to ensure they do not disproportionately affect the company's financial performance in future periods. 03/25/2024 - 04:59 PM ORLANDO, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- M-tron Industries, Inc. (NYSE American: MPTI) (“Company” or “MtronPTI”) announced its financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Management will host an earnings call on Tuesday, March 26, 2024 at 10:30am EST. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $41.2 million, an increase of $9.3 million, or 29.3%, from $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Consolidated gross margin improved to 40.7% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 35.6% for the prior year. Order backlog was $47.8 million, an increase of 3.6% compared to $46.2 million as of December 31, 2022. Diluted net income per share for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $1.28 and $0.67, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA, a Non-GAAP measure, was $7.7 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 versus $4.0 million for the prior year. Michael Ferrantino, MtronPTI’s Chief Executive Officer, stated, “MtronPTI had a great first year as a public company. We focused on improving our topline results each quarter while maintaining and improving margins wherever possible and maintaining our vigilance on general and administrative costs. We look forward to the continuing success of MtronPTI while helping our motivated employees and valued customers reach their goals in 2024 and beyond.” Results from Operations MtronPTI’s portfolio is divided into three product groupings, Frequency Control, Spectrum Control and Integrated Microwave Assemblies, and has expanded from primarily crystal-based components to include higher levels of integration, advanced materials science, cavity-based products, and various types of compensation methods employing integrated circuits and other methods to create products geared for applications that require high reliability in harsh environments. These products are differentiated by their precise level of accuracy, stability over time and within harsh environments, and very low phase noise. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $41,168,000, an increase of $9,323,000, or 29.3%, from $31,845,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in revenue reflects strong aerospace and defense product shipments. Gross margin improved to 40.7% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 35.6% for the prior year. Gross margins improved over last year reflecting the increased business volume and the effects of product mix changes, offset by inflationary headwinds due to labor and materials cost increases. As of December 31, 2023, our order backlog was $47,831,000, an increase of 3.6% compared to $46,180,000 as of December 31, 2022. In 2023 our book to bill ratio was greater than 1, at 1.04, with 2023 bookings of $42,818,000 following very strong 2022 bookings of $48,586,000. Our sales funnel continues to be strong as we continue with our new product offering and provide excellent technical and customer service to our customers. During the fourth quarter, all MtronPTI full-time employees below the executive level were issued a one-time stock option grant based on their respective years of service. The purpose of the grant was to reward employees for their past contribution to the Company and serves to align employee interests with those of our stockholders. The stock option grant vested immediately, and with a strike price of $36.06 and a life of three years, the Company recorded $2,013,000 of stock-based compensation expense related to its 183,300 stock options granted. The Company reported an operating income of $4,299,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to operating income of $2,875,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase reflects the higher revenues and effects from product mix changes, offset by increased engineering, selling and administrative expenses, which were 30.3% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 26.6% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Excluding the $2,013,000 one-time expense for stock options, engineering, selling and administrative expenses would have been 25.4% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, an improvement over the 26.6% recorded for the prior year. Quarterly, income before income taxes grew incrementally each quarter during 2024, from $719,000 in Q1, 2024, to $2,046,000 for Q3, 2024. Without the impact from the $2,013,000 one-time expense for stock options, income before income taxes for Q4, 2024 would have been $2,066,000, which would compare favorably to the $2,595,000 that was recorded for the entire 2022 year. Net income was $3,489,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $1,798,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Basic and diluted net income per share for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1.29 and $1.28, respectively, versus $0.67 per share for the year ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA, a Non-GAAP measure, was $2,425,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 versus $1,114,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, a portion of which was reported on a standalone basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $7,692,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023 versus $4,008,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, a portion of which was reported on a standalone basis. Adjusted EBITDA excluded excess Separation costs of $28,000 for 2023 and $219,000 for 2022. Included within the non-cash stock compensation is $2,013,000 for the impact of the one-time employee stock option grant. Note that adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2022 does not include any adjustments for the potential impact from the additional costs of being a publicly traded company. Management calculated the incremental direct costs of being a public company which do not have any comparable amounts in the prior year when results were presented partially on a standalone basis at $107,000 and $842,000 for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. MtronPTI’s Separation On October 7, 2022, the separation of the MtronPTI business from The LGL Group, Inc. (""LGL"" or ""LGL Group"") was completed (the ""Separation"") and the Company became an independent, publicly traded company trading on the NYSE American under the stock symbol ""MPTI."" The Company’s financial results for periods up to the Separation represent combined financial statements prepared on a “carve-out” basis. The Company’s financial statements and results for the periods after the Separation are consolidated and presented based on the results of the Company as a standalone company. Investor Call Management, including MtronPTI's CEO, Michael Ferrantino and CFO, James Tivy, will host a conference call with the investment community on Tuesday, March 26, 2024 to discuss the Company's 2023 year end results and to respond to investor questions.

Announces Proposed Underwritten Public Offering of Common Stock Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary AppTech Payments Corp. (APCX) announces a public offering to sell shares of its common stock and pre-funded warrants. The company aims to use the proceeds for business integration, working capital, and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by AppTech Payments Corp. of a public offering comprising shares and pre-funded warrants represents a strategic move to raise capital. From a financial perspective, the key elements to focus on include the use of proceeds, the market's reception of the offering and the potential dilution effect on current shareholders. The company's intent to allocate funds for business integration, working capital and general corporate purposes is a common strategy aimed at fueling growth and operational efficiency.However, the announcement's caution regarding market conditions and the lack of certainty about the completion and terms of the offering suggests a degree of market sensitivity. Investors and shareholders should monitor the uptake of the offering and the final terms, as these will impact the company's capital structure and share valuation. The role of EF Hutton LLC as the sole book-running manager indicates a streamlined approach to the offering, potentially expediting the process and minimizing underwriting costs.The use of a 'shelf' registration statement allows for a more rapid issue of securities, indicating that AppTech is seeking timely access to capital. This can be a double-edged sword, as market conditions at the time of the offering will greatly influence the success of the capital raise and the subsequent share price performance. Securities Lawyer AppTech's reliance on a 'shelf' registration statement for the offering is a regulatory mechanism that allows for flexibility and speed in capital raising. The SEC's clearance of this statement back in July 2022 means that the company has met the necessary regulatory requirements to proceed with the offering at any time within a set period.

The company's ownership interest in US Vanadium decreased from 4.75% to 1.24%, resulting in an unrealized loss of $1,338,413 on this investment. 03/25/2024 - 05:00 PM Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - March 25, 2024) - Elysee Development Corp. (TSXV: ELC) (FSE: QLDN) (the ""Company"") wishes to announce its audited financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023 (""FY 2023""). All dollar amounts are in Canadian funds unless otherwise noted. Highlights of Fiscal 2023 results include:Net loss of $ 4,034,438 ($0.14 per share) in FY 2023 as compared to a net loss of $2,328,192 in FY 2022, Net Asset Value as of December 31, 2023 of $0.39 per share; and Cash on hand as of December 31, 2023 of $849,798, with no debt. Fiscal 2023 was a difficult year for mining stocks in general, and exploration and early-stage development companies in particular, the primary focus of Elysee's portfolio. This overall market weakness resulted in an unrealized loss on marketable securities of $1,701,237.Management elected to take a prudent approach to the carrying value of Elysee's private equity investments, writing these down by $1,810,495. This amount includes $1,338,413 attributable to the Company's investment in US Vanadium LLC. In addition, the company realized a loss of $301,039 due to the restructuring of CareCru Inc., another private equity investment. For the year ended December 31, 2023, Elysee recorded a net loss of $4,034,438 ($0.14 per share). General and administrative expenses declined from $755,044 to $537,436 due to lower management fees and reduced share-based payments on the granting of incentive stock options. Interest and dividend income increased from $339,681 to $521,152.For the three-month period ended December 31, 2023 (Q4 2023) the Company's net and comprehensive loss of $2,131,366 was mainly due to a downward adjustment of the value of our private equity investments for an amount of $1,810,495 and a write-off of $134,209 on private equity. In Q4 there was an unrealized gain of $121,310 on marketable securities and interest and dividend income of $69,135. The company realized a loss on marketable securities of $207,007.Due to market conditions, management of Elysee did not pay any cash bonuses in FY 2023 and issued a reduced number of incentive stock options.Dividend and NAVThe board of directors of Elysee has decided not to pay a dividend this year but prefers to keep the cash within the company to take advantage of the fact that many exploration and development companies are undervalued. ""Despite the fact that gold and copper prices are on the rise, stocks of mining companies remain depressed. The discrepancy between metal prices and the evolution of share prices creates a great buying opportunity. It is management's intention to put our cash to work in the coming months,"" stated Guido Cloetens, President and CEO of Elysee Development Company. ""The company will re-focus on its core business, investing in promising and undervalued mining projects with significant upside potential.""After paying out a $0.01 per share cash dividend for fiscal 2022 (a total of $284,506) on April 11, 2023, the Company's Net Asset Value decreased from $15.4 million on December 31, 2022 ($0.54 per share) to $11.2 million ($0.39 per share) on December 31, 2023. Cash on hand as of December 31, 2023, was $849,798, with no debt other than trade payables. Investment HighlightsThe Company's most significant investment is US Vanadium Holding Company LLC (""US Vanadium""), a US Limited Liability Corporation (""US LLC"") which owns and operates two facilities in Arkansas that produce high-purity vanadium oxides and downstream vanadium chemicals for customers in the catalyst, chemical, petrochemical, titanium, and energy storage industries. As a US LLC, US Vanadium has a fixed number of capital units that always remains the same. When new investments are made, the units are re-allocated among the investors with changes to the effective amount paid per capital unit. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company's ownership interest held in US Vanadium decreased from 4.75% to 1.24% as a result of US Vanadium completing further investment financings in which the Company did not participate. Consequently, the Company reduced the fair value of its investment from $3,174,685 to $1,836,272 to reflect the change to its ownership interest and recognized an unrealized loss on this private equity investment of $1,338,413. For more information, please visit https://usvanadium.com/about-us/.On December 31, 2023 Elysee's portfolio of marketable securities (excluding private equity) consisted mostly of investments in precious metals miners and exploration companies, base metal companies and energy-related equities. The most significant publicly traded equity positions held by Elysee at the end of December 31, 2023, were Arizona Sonoran Copper Company Inc., Dundee Precious Metals Inc., Green Impact Partners Inc., Agnico-Eagle Mines Limited and Hudbay Minerals Inc. For more information on these investments and others made during the period, please refer to Elysee's web site and the Company's MD&A dated March 22, 2024.During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company purchased 212,000 of its common shares at a total cost of $88,746 pursuant to a Normal Course Issuer Bid. As of December 31, 2023, there were 28,585,113 shares issued and outstanding. On December 31, 2023, Elysee's net asset value (""NAV"") was $0.39 per share. NAV is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) measure calculated as the value of total assets less the value of total liabilities divided by the total number of common shares outstanding as at a specific date. For the purpose of this calculation, share purchase warrants held by Elysee were valued using the Black-Scholes model calculation, as reported in Elysee's annual and quarterly financial statements. The term NAV does not have any standardized meaning according to GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. There is no comparable GAAP measure presented in the Company's financial statements and thus no applicable quantitative reconciliation for such non-GAAP financial measure. The Company believes that NAV can provide information useful to its shareholders in understanding its performance and may assist in the evaluation of its business relative to that of its peers.

The company secures $130 million to fund operations through mid-2026, with shares trading under the ticker symbol 'QTTB' on Nasdaq. Positive None. Negative None. Biotech Equity Research Analyst The merger between Q32 Bio and Homology Medicines, accompanied by a private placement raising $42 million, marks a significant strategic move for Q32 Bio. The post-transaction liquidity position of approximately $130 million is a robust runway, expected to fund operations into mid-2026. This financial stability is pivotal for biotech companies, which often face capital-intensive development phases with prolonged periods without revenue.Investors should note the emphasis on the advancement of bempikibart (ADX-914) and ADX-097, which are in Phase 2 clinical trials for atopic dermatitis, alopecia areata and complement disorders. The success of these trials could signal a breakthrough in treatments for these conditions, potentially leading to substantial market opportunities. The commitment to report Phase 2 results in the second half of 2024 and 2025, respectively, provides clear milestones that can impact the company's valuation and investor sentiment.However, the biotech industry is fraught with risks, including clinical trial failures, regulatory hurdles and market competition. The positive Phase 1 trial results for ADX-097 are encouraging, but Phase 2 trials will be more telling of its efficacy and safety profile. The novel approach of tissue-targeted complement inhibition, if successful, could differentiate ADX-097 from existing therapies and create a competitive edge. Healthcare Investment Banker The transaction details reveal a 1-for-18 reverse stock split and the issuance of contingent value rights (CVRs) to Homology shareholders. Reverse stock splits are often employed to meet exchange listing requirements or to adjust the perception of the stock's value. CVRs are a strategic tool to bridge valuation gaps in mergers, providing potential future payouts based on the success of legacy assets. This structure showcases an innovative approach to deal-making in the biotech sector, potentially making the merger more palatable to Homology investors wary of the risks associated with Q32 Bio's pipeline.From an investment banking perspective, the involvement of multiple reputable financial advisors and legal counsels underscores the complexity and significance of the deal. The merger and subsequent capital raise could serve as a catalyst for Q32 Bio's stock, with the new ticker symbol 'QTTB' aiding in rebranding efforts. However, investors should be cautious as the realization of CVR payouts is uncertain and depends on the successful disposition of Homology's pre-transaction assets. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The therapeutic areas addressed by Q32 Bio's pipeline, specifically atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata, represent markets with substantial patient populations and unmet medical needs. The global atopic dermatitis market alone is projected to grow significantly, driven by a rise in prevalence and demand for advanced therapeutics.Q32 Bio's focus on immune homeostasis and its novel platform for complement inhibition positions the company within a niche yet potentially lucrative segment of the market. The success of bempikibart and ADX-097 could capture a notable share of these markets. However, the competitive landscape includes several established and emerging players, which could influence Q32 Bio's market penetration and pricing strategies.Investors should monitor the enrollment progress and interim data from the ongoing clinical trials, as these can serve as indicators of potential regulatory success and market acceptance. Moreover, strategic partnerships or licensing agreements may become pivotal for commercialization, especially given the company's current focus on R&D over immediate revenue generation. 03/25/2024 - 04:15 PM -- Q32 Bio to focus on advancement of bempikibart (ADX-914) in ongoing atopic dermatitis (AD) and alopecia areata (AA) Phase 2 clinical trials and commencement of ADX-097 Phase 2 renal basket clinical trial in patients with complement disorders -- -- Post-transaction cash, cash equivalents and investments of approximately $130 million expected to fund operations to mid-2026, including key Phase 2 readouts for bempikibart in 2H'24 and ADX-097 Phase 2 topline results in 2H'25 -- -- Shares to trade on Nasdaq under the new ticker symbol ""QTTB"" commencing on March 26, 2024 -- WALTHAM, Mass., March 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Q32 Bio Inc. (NASDAQ: QTTB) (""Q32 Bio""), a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing biologic therapeutics to restore immune homeostasis, today announced the completion of its previously announced merger with Homology Medicines, Inc. (""Homology""). The combined company will operate under the name Q32 Bio, and its shares are expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq Global Market on March 26, 2024, under the ticker symbol ""QTTB"". Concurrent with the closing of the merger, Q32 Bio completed a $42 million private placement with a syndicate of existing and new investors including OrbiMed, Atlas Venture, Abingworth, Bristol Myers Squibb, Acorn Bioventures, Osage University Partners, CU Healthcare Innovation Fund, Sanofi Ventures, Agent Capital and other undisclosed investors. Following the transactions, Q32 Bio's cash, cash equivalents and investments of approximately $130 million, before payment of final transaction-related expenses, are expected to fund operations through mid-2026. ""It's an exciting time to be transitioning into a publicly traded company as we prepare to complete and release results from two bempikibart placebo-controlled Phase 2 trials later this year and initiate the first Phase 2 trial for our lead tissue-targeted complement inhibitor ADX-097, and prepare to initiate a second ADX-097 trial in early 2025 with topline results expected for both by year-end 2025,"" said Jodie Morrison, Chief Executive Officer of Q32 Bio. ""With a solid financial foundation and investor syndicate, a world-class leadership team, and near-term data readouts in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases with significant unmet needs, we believe we are strongly positioned to enter the public markets, setting the stage for multiple potential opportunities for meaningful value creation. We are thrilled to be completing this transformative transaction that propels Q32 into its next stage of growth."" Bempikibart, Q32 Bio's most advanced product candidate, is a fully human anti-IL-7Rα antibody designed to re-regulate adaptive immune function by blocking signaling mediated by both IL-7 and TSLP and is currently being evaluated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trials evaluating the use in AD and AA. Q32 Bio remains on track to report topline Phase 2 results from both trials in the second half of 2024. ADX-097 is based on a novel platform enabling tissue-targeted regulation of the complement system without long-term systemic blockade, a key differentiator from current complement therapeutics. Q32 Bio has completed a first-in-human, Phase 1 ascending dose clinical trial of ADX-097 in healthy volunteers. Results from the Phase 1 trial demonstrated a favorable tolerability and immunogenicity profile across all single and multiple dose cohorts and weekly subcutaneous dosing met exposures for predicted complete complement inhibition in the tissue with no systemic inhibition. Q32 Bio is currently initiating an open-label Phase 2 renal basket trial and will initiate a Phase 2 trial in ANCA-Associated Vasculitis (AAV) in the first half of 2025. Results from both trials are expected in the second half of 2025. Transaction Details In connection with the closing of the merger, Homology enacted a 1-for-18 reverse stock split of its common stock and issued a non-transferable contingent value right (a ""CVR"") to Homology shareholders of record as of March 21, 2024, which does not include the former holders of shares of Q32 Bio or the private placement investors. Holders of the CVR will be entitled to receive certain cash payments from proceeds received by the Company, if any, related to the dispositions of Homology's pre-transaction legacy assets. Following the reverse stock split and based on the final exchange ratio of 0.8676 shares of Homology common stock for each share of Q32 Bio common stock, at the closing of the merger there are approximately 11,963,142 shares of the combined company's common stock outstanding, with prior Homology stockholders owning approximately 25.6% and prior Q32 Bio stockholders (including investors in the private placement) holding approximately 74.4% of the combined company's outstanding common stock. Leerink Partners served as the exclusive financial advisor to Q32 Bio. Leerink Partners, Piper Sandler, Guggenheim Securities, and Oppenheimer & Co. served as placement agents for Q32 Bio's private placement. Goodwin Procter LLP is serving as legal counsel to Q32 Bio. TD Cowen served as the exclusive financial advisor and Latham & Watkins LLP served as legal counsel to Homology. About Q32 Bio Q32 Bio is a clinical stage biotechnology company developing biologic therapeutics targeting potent regulators of the innate and adaptive immune systems to re-balance immunity in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Q32 Bio's lead programs, focused on the IL-7 / TSLP receptor pathways and complement system, address immune dysregulation to help patients take back control of their lives.

It is being evaluated in two Phase 2 trials for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata. The IL-7 and TSLP pathways have been genetically and biologically implicated in driving several T cell-mediated pathological processes in numerous autoimmune diseases. Q32 Bio's program for innate immunity, ADX-097, is based on a novel platform enabling tissue-targeted regulation of the complement system without long-term systemic blockade – a key differentiator versus current complement therapeutics. Q32 Bio has completed a first-in-human, Phase 1 ascending dose clinical study of ADX-097 in healthy volunteers. For more information, visit www.Q32Bio.com.

AXIS Capital Announces Publication of the Company's 2023 Loss Development Triangles,2024-03-25T20:15:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"AXIS Capital Holdings  (AXS) releases 2023 Loss Development Triangles with detailed data on paid, incurred, and ultimate losses for Insurance and Reinsurance segments.","AXIS Capital Announces Publication of the Company's 2023 Loss Development Triangles Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary AXIS Capital Holdings (AXS) releases 2023 Loss Development Triangles with detailed data on paid, incurred, and ultimate losses for Insurance and Reinsurance segments. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The publication of AXIS Capital's 2023 Loss Development Triangles provides investors with critical insights into the company's claims experience, reserve adequacy and overall financial health. Analyzing this data, one can infer the trends in claims settlements and the robustness of the company's reserving methodology. It's important to note that the loss development triangles reflect both paid and incurred losses, which can indicate the company's efficiency in claims management and its anticipation of future claims.By examining the data net of reinsurance, stakeholders gain a clearer picture of the underlying performance of AXIS Capital's business without the noise introduced by reinsurance recoveries. This level of detail across 15 lines of business allows for a granular assessment of which segments are performing above or below expectations. A trend of improving loss ratios could signal operational improvements, while deteriorating trends might raise concerns about underwriting discipline or market conditions. Actuarial Analyst Loss Development Triangles are actuarial tools used to project future claims costs and assess the sufficiency of loss reserves. They are pivotal in estimating the 'ultimate losses' which are the total expected payouts for claims. For AXIS Capital, the data delineated on an accident-year basis enables actuaries to track the development of claims from the year they occurred, providing a longitudinal view of the risk profile and the accuracy of past reserve estimates.Anomalies in the development patterns could suggest changes in claims settlement processes or shifts in the legal environment affecting claim costs. Actuaries will be keen to analyze the triangles for signs of adverse development, which could necessitate additional reserves, or favorable development, which might lead to reserve releases. Such movements have direct implications on the company's balance sheet and profit and loss statements. Risk Management Expert From a risk management perspective, the Loss Development Triangles are instrumental in identifying areas of potential volatility in AXIS Capital's portfolio. They enable risk managers to pinpoint lines of business that may be subject to greater uncertainty or that exhibit patterns suggesting a need for underwriting adjustments. For instance, a line of business showing a consistent pattern of reserve strengthening could indicate systemic underestimation of risk, while stable or decreasing patterns may imply a well-managed risk profile.Furthermore, the ultimate losses net of reinsurance serve as a measure of the retained risk and can inform decisions on reinsurance purchasing strategies. Effective risk management hinges on the ability to accurately predict and prepare for future liabilities and these triangles are a cornerstone in that process. 03/25/2024 - 04:15 PM PEMBROKE, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AXIS Capital Holdings Limited (""AXIS Capital"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: AXS) today announced the publication of the Company's 2023 Loss Development Triangles.

Announces Closing of Initial Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags IPO offering Rhea-AI Summary LOBO EV Technologies announced the closing of its IPO, offering 1,380,000 shares at $4.00 per share, raising approximately $5.5 million. The underwriters have an option to purchase an additional 207,000 shares. The shares started trading on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol 'LOBO'. Kingswood acted as the sole bookrunner for the offering. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The successful closing of LOBO EV Technologies Ltd.'s initial public offering (IPO) is a significant milestone for the company. The IPO process is a critical step for a company to gain access to public capital markets, which can provide the necessary funding for expansion and development. The relatively modest gross proceeds of $5.5 million indicate a cautious approach, possibly reflecting the company's strategic choice to limit dilution of existing shareholders or to manage market expectations.With the electric vehicle (EV) market experiencing rapid growth, driven by global efforts to reduce carbon emissions, LOBO's entry into the public market may position it well to capitalize on industry trends. However, the size of the IPO suggests that LOBO is still in the early stages of growth compared to established players in the EV sector. Investors may view the additional 45-day option for underwriters to purchase extra shares to cover over-allotments as a positive sign of potential demand for LOBO's shares, or as a buffer for price stabilization post-IPO. Financial Analyst The initial offering price of $4.00 per share places LOBO in the lower end of the market capitalization spectrum, which could attract investors seeking entry points into the EV industry without the higher price tags associated with larger firms. However, the market will be closely watching LOBO's performance in the coming quarters for signs of growth and profitability. The role of Kingswood as the sole bookrunner is also noteworthy; the reputation and expertise of the underwriter can significantly influence investor confidence.From a financial perspective, the key factors to monitor will be the company's use of the IPO proceeds, the execution of its business plan and its ability to navigate the competitive landscape. The EV market is capital intensive, with significant costs associated with research and development, manufacturing and market penetration. Therefore, the adequacy of the $5.5 million raised, in relation to LOBO's strategic goals, will be an area of interest for investors. Legal Expert The mention of the SEC's involvement and the availability of a final prospectus through the SEC's website underscores the regulatory compliance aspect of the IPO process. This is a critical element, as it provides transparency and protection for investors. The legal framework surrounding public offerings, including the need for registration and the provision of a prospectus, is designed to ensure that all material information is disclosed. For LOBO, adherence to these regulations can build trust with potential investors.It is also important to note the disclaimer regarding the sale of securities.

Ongoing patient enrollment in investigator-initiated randomized Phase 2 study for zotatifin in ER+ breast cancer. Negative None. Oncology Clinical Research Analyst The anticipated release of topline data from the Phase 2b KICKSTART trial of tomivosertib combined with pembrolizumab for NSCLC is a significant event for stakeholders. The primary endpoint, progression-free survival (PFS), alongside secondary endpoints such as safety and Objective Response Rate (ORR), will provide valuable insights into the drug's efficacy and safety profile. An early indication of Overall Survival (OS) data, although more mature data will follow, could signal the potential for long-term benefits to patients. The trial's design, focusing on patients with high PD-L1 expression, aligns with current trends in personalized cancer therapy, where treatment is tailored based on specific biomarkers.Furthermore, the Fast Track designation for zotatifin in ER+/HER2- advanced metastatic breast cancer underscores the FDA's recognition of the drug's potential to address an unmet medical need. This designation could expedite the review process and potentially shorten the time to market, assuming positive clinical outcomes. The reported median PFS of 7.4 months in a heavily pretreated patient cohort is notable, as it may indicate a clinically meaningful benefit in a population with limited options.The financial aspect, including the $15.0 million raised through registered direct financing, is also critical. It extends the company's cash runway into the first quarter of 2025, providing stability for ongoing clinical development. Investors should note the dilutive impact of the financing on existing shareholders, but also consider the potential for future value creation if the clinical programs succeed. Biotech Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, eFFECTOR Therapeutics' announcement contains several key points that investors should consider. The lack of revenue for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023, compared to the previous year, is not unusual for a clinical-stage biotech company. However, it highlights the company's reliance on clinical trial outcomes and subsequent product commercialization for future revenue streams.The reported decrease in R&D and G&A expenses may reflect efficient resource management, which is essential for a company with no current product revenue. The reduction of non-cash stock compensation expense is also a positive indicator of cost control. Nevertheless, the net loss for the year has increased significantly, which is a factor that investors should watch, as it could impact the company's financial sustainability if not offset by successful clinical developments and potential partnerships or fundraising.Lastly, the change in the fair value of the earn-out liability, which has been reduced to zero, removes a potential obligation from the company's balance sheet, thereby improving its financial position. The increase in shares outstanding, due to the financing and the reverse stock split, has implications for shareholder value, as it suggests potential dilution but also reflects measures taken to ensure the company's financial stability and continued operation. Market Research Analyst The landscape for NSCLC treatments is highly competitive, with multiple targeted therapies and immunotherapies available. The success of tomivosertib could hinge on demonstrating superior efficacy or a better safety profile compared to existing treatments. The drug's unique mechanism, as an MNK inhibitor, could offer a differentiated approach to treatment, potentially carving out a niche in the market. The market's response to the Phase 2b trial results will depend on how tomivosertib's efficacy and safety compare with current standard-of-care treatments.For zotatifin, the Fast Track designation and positive interim Phase 2 data suggest potential for a favorable market entry, especially in genomically-defined subgroups of breast cancer. The company's strategic collaboration with Stanford Medicine for the ongoing Phase 2 study in ER+ breast cancer could enhance the drug's profile by targeting specific patient populations likely to benefit from the treatment. As precision medicine gains traction, the ability to identify and effectively treat such subgroups could be a key market differentiator.The extension of the cash runway into the first quarter of 2025 offers eFFECTOR Therapeutics a cushion to navigate the capital-intensive phases of clinical trials without immediate pressure to secure additional funding. This financial stability is likely to be viewed positively by the market, as it reduces the risk of near-term financial distress and allows for a focus on clinical and regulatory milestones. 03/25/2024 - 04:01 PM Topline data from the randomized Phase 2b KICKSTART trial of tomivosertib combined with pembrolizumab in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) expected in early April 2024 Median progression free survival (mPFS) of 7.4 months in the ZFA expansion cohort evaluating zotatifin in combination with fulvestrant and abemaciclib in heavily pretreated patients Received U.S. FDA Fast Track designation for zotatifin in combination with fulvestrant and abemaciclib for treatment of ER+/HER2- advanced metastatic breast cancer Raised $15.0 million in gross proceeds from registered direct financing, extending cash runway into first quarter of 2025 SOLANA BEACH, Calif. and REDWOOD CITY, Calif., March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- eFFECTOR Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: EFTR), a leader in the development of selective translation regulator inhibitors (STRIs) for the treatment of cancer, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a corporate update. “In 2023 we continued to advance the development of our two wholly-owned clinical assets, tomivosertib and zotatifin, while strengthening our balance sheet to extend cash runway into the first quarter of 2025,” remarked Steve Worland, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of eFFECTOR. “We are excited to report topline results, expected in early April 2024, from our randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2b KICKSTART trial of tomivosertib, an MNK inhibitor designed to activate T cells, combined with pembrolizumab in frontline metastatic NSCLC. These data will include progression-free survival (PFS), the primary endpoint of the trial, as well as select secondary endpoints. These results, if positive, would enable activities, including interactions with regulatory agencies, intended to support initiation of a Phase 3 registrational trial.” “We are also pleased with the progress of zotatifin, including the 7.4 month mPFS previously reported for the ZFA expansion cohort that evaluated zotatifin in combination with fulvestrant and abemaciclib in heavily pretreated patients with ER+ breast cancer,” continued Dr. Worland. “In light of favorable safety and tolerability data, and in order to optimize zotatifin’s therapeutic potential, we resumed dose escalation using a more convenient schedule of dosing every other week. We look forward to finalizing the dose and schedule for zotatifin prior to interacting with the FDA in the second half of 2024, utilizing the recently granted Fast Track designation to expedite further development. We believe the zotatifin program is well positioned to move into a randomized trial in late 2024.” Pipeline Highlights Tomivosertib (eFT508): eFFECTOR’s wholly-owned, highly selective MNK inhibitor designed to enhance anti-tumor immune activity by activating T cells, delaying their exhaustion, and expanding the pool of central memory T cells: Topline results from Phase 2b KICKSTART trial in NSCLC expected in early April 2024. The company expects the release of topline data in early April, which will reflect a database snapshot taken on March 19, 2024, will include the primary endpoint of PFS and secondary endpoints including safety, Objective Response Rate (ORR), and an initial analysis of Overall Survival (OS). More mature OS data is anticipated in the second half of 2024. The primary analysis will reflect 37 PFS events, which provides approximately 80% power to detect a PFS hazard ratio of 0.65 at a p≤0.2. The KICKSTART trial enrolled 54 patients with PD-L1 expression ≥50% who were randomized to receive tomivosertib or placebo, in combination with pembrolizumab, as their initial therapy for metastatic disease. If positive results are obtained from KICKSTART, we plan to interact with the FDA in the second half of 2024 prior to initiating a Phase 3 registration trial.Phase 1 investigator-initiated dose escalation trial in patients with relapsed/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in collaboration with Northwestern University. Currently enrolling patients, the trial is designed to capitalize on previously published results that showed preclinical activity of tomivosertib in AML models. Once the appropriate dose for tomivosertib in AML is identified, the company hopes to expand the trial to test tomivosertib in combination with venetoclax and azacytidine. The study is led by Shira Dinner, M.D., Associate Professor of Medicine (Hematology and Oncology) at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. Zotatifin (eFT226): eFFECTOR’s wholly-owned potent and selective inhibitor of mRNA helicase eIF4A designed to downregulate expression of key oncoproteins and cell cycle proteins that drive tumor growth and resistance: Positive interim Phase 2 data including mPFS of 7.4 months in the ZFA triplet expansion cohort reported at the 2023 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS®). In the ZFA triplet cohort, wherein patients with a median of four prior lines of therapy for metastatic disease received 0.07 mg/kg zotatifin dosed on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle, combined with fulvestrant and abemaciclib, the mPFS was 7.4 months (95% confidence intervals 2.8 to non-estimable). As previously reported, five of 19 (26%) RECIST-evaluable patients had partial responses, including four confirmed and one unconfirmed. The ZFA triplet continued to be generally well tolerated, with the majority of zotatifin-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) being Grade 1 or 2. The most common zotatifin-related TEAEs were nausea, vomiting, and fatigue, all of which were Grade 1 or 2. The most common Grade 3 or higher zotatifin-related TEAEs were anemia and blood creatinine phosphokinase increase, each in two of 20 (10%) patients. Four of 20 (20%) of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events of any cause.Dose escalation now focused on the ZFA triplet. Based on favorable safety and tolerability results observed in more than 50 patients who received zotatifin at the initial recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 0.07 mg/kg on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle, as monotherapy, ZF doublet or ZFA triplet, dose escalation was resumed using a more convenient schedule of zotatifin dosed every other week (Q2W). In the first quarter of 2024, dose escalation of the ZF doublet concluded with the determination of 0.2 mg/kg zotatifin Q2W as the new RP2D for the doublet, which is projected to provide approximately twice the overall zotatifin exposure compared to the initial RP2D. Determination of the RP2D for the ZFA triplet is ongoing. The company looks forward to finalizing the dose and schedule for zotatifin in the ZFA triplet and interacting with the FDA prior to initiating a randomized, potentially registrational, trial in ER+ breast cancer.Ongoing patient enrollment in investigator-initiated randomized Phase 2 study in ER+ breast cancer. The study is being conducted as part of a collaboration with Stanford Medicine in which zotatifin is being tested in specific genomically-defined subgroups, including standard-risk patients as well as high-risk patients carrying specific markers predictive of relapse. The trial is led by Jennifer Caswell-Jin, M.D., Assistant Professor of Medicine at Stanford Medicine, and brings to the clinic the science of integrative subgroups of breast cancer, building on work done by Christian Curtis, Ph.D., Professor of Medicine, Genetics, and Biomedical Data Science, and Director of Artificial Intelligence and Cancer Genomics at Stanford Medicine. Business Highlights $15.0 million in gross proceeds raised from registered direct financing, extending cash runway into the first quarter of 2025. The Company completed a registered direct financing that closed on January 29, 2024, which included the sale of an aggregate of 1,488,834 shares of common stock (or common stock equivalents in lieu thereof), at a purchase price of $10.075 per share (or common stock equivalent in lieu thereof) and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,488,834 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $9.95 per share. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results Cash Position and Guidance: The company had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaling $18.4 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $26.3 million as of December 31, 2022. After incorporating the net proceeds of $13.6 million raised from the registered direct financing in January 2024, the company anticipates that its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund operations into the first quarter of 2025. Revenue: Revenue was zero for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to approximately $0.7 million for the same quarter of 2022. Revenue for the full year of 2023 was zero, compared to $3.6 million for the full year of 2022. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, consisted of grant revenue in connection with the company’s subaward from the University of California San Francisco under a grant from DARPA to investigate new COVID-19 treatments. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses were $6.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $6.6 million for the same quarter of 2022. R&D expenses were $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $23.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease for the year was due to lower consultant and personnel costs, along with lower external development expenses surrounding the zotatifin program, partially offset by increased external development expenses surrounding the KICKSTART trial for tomivosertib. R&D expenses included approximately $1.9 million and $2.6 million of non-cash stock compensation expense in the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses: G&A expenses were $2.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $2.7 million for the same quarter of 2022. G&A expenses were $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease for the year was primarily due to a decrease in the cost of director and officer insurance premiums, reduced personnel-related costs, and reduced professional service costs, including external audit and legal. G&A expenses included approximately $2.6 million and $2.7 million of non-cash stock compensation expense in the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Other Income (Expense): Other expense was $0.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, and 2022. Other expense was $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and other income was $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Other expense in the year ended December 31, 2023, consisted primarily of interest expense associated with the company’s term loans. Other income in the year ended December 31, 2022, consisted primarily of income related to the change in fair value of the company’s earn-out liability for the period, partially offset by interest expense associated with the company’s term loans. The fair value of the share earn-out liability of $61.0 million at the closing date of the business combination in August 2021 was remeasured at $6 thousand as of December 31, 2022. The earn-out period expired in August 2023 resulting in a reduction of the corresponding earn-out liability to zero as of December 31, 2023. Net Loss: Net loss was $9.1 million, or $3.42 per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $9.3 million, or $5.57 per basic and diluted share, for the same quarter of 2022. Net loss was $35.8 million, or $16.37 per basic and diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $22.7 million, or $13.76 per basic and diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2022. Shares outstanding as of December 31, 3023, and 2022 were 2,982,679 and 1,667,602, respectively, after taking into effect the retroactive application of the 25:1 reverse stock split completed on January 12, 2024. About eFFECTOR Therapeutics eFFECTOR is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the development of a new class of oncology drugs referred to as STRIs. eFFECTOR’s STRI product candidates target the eIF4F complex and its activating kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase interacting kinase (MNK). The eIF4F complex is a central node where two of the most frequently mutated signaling pathways in cancer, the PI3K-AKT and RAS-MEK pathways, converge to activate the translation of select mRNA into proteins that are frequent culprits in key disease-driving processes. Each of eFFECTOR’s product candidates is designed to act on a single protein that drives the expression of a network of functionally related proteins, including oncoproteins and immunosuppressive proteins in T cells, that together control tumor growth, survival and immune evasion. eFFECTOR’s lead product candidate, tomivosertib, is a MNK inhibitor designed to activate T cells and is currently being evaluated in KICKSTART, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b trial of tomivosertib in combination with pembrolizumab as frontline treatment in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Zotatifin, eFFECTOR’s inhibitor of eIF4A, is currently being evaluated in Phase 2a expansion cohorts in certain biomarker-positive solid tumors, including ER+ breast cancer and KRAS-mutant NSCLC. eFFECTOR has a global collaboration with Pfizer to develop inhibitors of a third target, eIF4E.

Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary KBRA assigns favorable ratings to Provident Financial Services, Inc. and its subsidiary, Provident Bank, supported by a strong banking model and pending merger with Lakeland Bancorp, Inc. The company has shown solid earnings performance and credit quality, with manageable risks and conservative capital management. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The ratings assigned by Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) to Provident Financial Services, Inc. and its main subsidiary, Provident Bank, are indicative of the company's solid financial position and the effective execution of its business model. The 'BBB+' and 'A-' ratings for senior unsecured and deposit debt respectively, suggest a strong ability to meet financial commitments, which is important for investor confidence. The stable outlook reflects a balanced risk profile and the expectation of consistent performance.From an investment perspective, the announced combination with Lakeland Bancorp, Inc. is noteworthy. Mergers and acquisitions can be catalysts for stock price movement due to the potential for cost savings, increased market share and enhanced earnings. The alignment in corporate culture and minimal integration risk could smooth the transition and support the financial metrics that underpin these ratings. The transaction is likely to be closely watched by investors for its execution and the realization of the anticipated synergies.Provident's low-cost deposit base and effective cost controls are key factors contributing to its robust net interest margin (NIM) and return on assets (ROA), which are important metrics for assessing a bank's profitability and efficiency. However, the modest increase in provision for loan losses, driven by a weaker economic outlook, is a concern that warrants monitoring as it could signal rising credit risk. Despite this, Provident's credit profile appears resilient, with a low net charge-off (NCO) ratio and a conservative capital management approach. Market Research Analyst The banking industry is sensitive to economic cycles and interest rate fluctuations. Provident's performance through various cycles demonstrates adaptability and resilience, key attributes for long-term stability. The company's exposure to the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, particularly in investor CRE, is significant. While this concentration presents a risk, Provident's minimal exposure to the troubled office sector and strategic focus on the more resilient medical space mitigate this concern.The banking sector is currently facing headwinds from rising interest rates, which can squeeze NIMs. Provident's low deposit beta, which measures the sensitivity of deposit costs to changing interest rates, suggests that the company is better positioned than some peers to manage this aspect of its balance sheet. This is a positive sign for investors looking for banks that can navigate the rising rate environment effectively.Investors should also consider the company's liquidity management, as indicated by the loan-to-deposit ratio. While Provident operates with a higher ratio, suggesting a more aggressive stance, its adequate liquidity, including on-balance sheet and contingent funding sources, should reassure stakeholders about its ability to meet short-term obligations. Credit Analyst KBRA's ratings provide a comprehensive view of Provident's creditworthiness, which is essential for assessing the risk of lending to or investing in the company. The ratings reflect a balance of strengths, such as a well-executed banking model and experienced management, against potential vulnerabilities like the high concentration in investor CRE loans.The credit implications of the pending merger with Lakeland Bancorp are significant. A successful integration can lead to a stronger, more diversified institution. However, investors should be aware of the potential for execution risk and the impact on capital ratios post-acquisition. Provident's intention to rebuild capital ratios to historical levels post-acquisition will be an important factor to track, as it speaks to the company's commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet.Finally, Provident's credit profile benefits from its disciplined approach to underwriting and loan monitoring, which has kept credit losses low historically. The company's conservative approach to capital management, with a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio averaging 11.6% since 2018, provides a buffer against potential credit losses, an aspect that is reassuring for debt holders and investors alike. 03/25/2024 - 02:40 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- KBRA assigns a senior unsecured debt rating of BBB+, a subordinated debt rating of BBB, and a short-term debt rating of K2 to Iselin, New Jersey-based Provident Financial Services, Inc. (NYSE: PFS) (""Provident"" or ""the company""). In addition, KBRA assigns deposit and senior unsecured debt ratings of A-, a subordinated debt rating of BBB+, and short-term deposit and debt ratings of K2 to its main subsidiary, Provident Bank. The Outlook for all long-term ratings is Stable. Provident’s ratings are supported by its well-executed banking model that has been implemented by an experienced management team, which has produced favorable long-term performance through various economic and interest rate cycles. The pending combination with Lakeland Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: LBAI or ""Lakeland"") is expected to provide significant scale, deepen the executive team, and deliver further diversification opportunities to the pro forma company. We view the anticipated transaction as strategically positive as both institutions reflect many similarities, including conservative credit cultures and an emphasis on maintaining strong core deposit franchises. Moreover, the acquisition offers meaningful potential for improved earnings capacity, with minimal integration/execution risk given the aforementioned cultural alignment, geographic overlap, and management’s proven track record. PFS has reported solid earnings results in recent years, with core ROA averaging just under 1.20% from 2018-2022, which was reinforced by a durable NIM, in part, due to its low-cost deposit base (1.95% for 4Q23), consistent noninterest income levels (tracking between 15%-20% of total revenue), and effective cost controls. Moreover, profitability has remained respectable in 2023 (core ROA just below 1.00%) despite NIM headwinds and a modest increase to provision for loan losses, principally driven by weakening economic forecasts. Despite an elevated concentration in investor CRE (58% of total loans or 469% of total risk-based capital as of 4Q23), we believe that the company reflects a comparatively lower risk credit profile, evidenced by an NCO ratio that has averaged a minimal 20 bps since 2007, and has been supported by stringent underwriting and in-depth monitoring and review. Moving forward, Provident is relatively insulated from the maturity wall looming in the CRE space, with a minimal amount of repricing set to occur over the next twelve months. Moreover, the company's exposure to the troubled office sector is manageable at 4% of total loans, with a meaningful portion of the tenant mix being concentrated in the medical space, which provides more resiliency, in our view. Additionally, it is worth noting, despite being situated in close proximity to the NYC markets, as well as reflecting an above average exposure to multifamily (17% of loans at YE23), PFS has a minimal concentration in the rent-regulated space (1% of total loans). As such, combined with the manageable level of criticized/classified loans, and minimal amount of delinquent loans, we believe the company's near-term credit risks are comparatively low. Capital has been consistently managed in a conservative fashion, with a CET1 averaging 11.6% since 2018, though ratios are expected to decrease considerably following the proposed acquisition and the related interest rate marks on LBAI’s securities and loan portfolios. However, management has made clear the intention to fully rebuild capital ratios closer to historical levels over the medium term. KBRA also recognizes Provident's quality core deposit franchise, which has been rather resilient despite the shrinking deposit levels across the industry and continues to reflect a majority of total funding (81% as of YE23). Moreover, as noted, the company maintains a below average deposit beta, which has persisted throughout various interest rate cycles, and has consistently tracked lower than local peers. While liquidity as measured by the loan-to-deposit ratio has generally been more aggressive at right above or below 100% (105% as of YE23), we view total available liquidity, including on-balance sheet and contingent funding sources, as adequate in the context of uninsured deposit balances, deposit flows, and growth prospects.

Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Provident Financial Services, Inc. and Lakeland Bancorp, Inc. have received regulatory approvals for their merger, pending approval from the Federal Reserve System. The combined company will operate under the Provident name, focusing on growth and profitability. Provident Bank will raise $200 million in capital before the merger, with specific conditions and commitments outlined in the approvals. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of regulatory approvals for the merger between Provident Financial Services and Lakeland Bancorp is a significant step towards the consolidation of these banking entities. From a financial standpoint, the merger is poised to create a 'super-community bank' with enhanced scale, which typically translates into improved bargaining power with vendors, access to a broader customer base and potential cost synergies.However, the condition of a $200 million capital raise through Tier 2 subordinated debt is noteworthy. This form of debt is subordinate to other debts should the company fall into liquidation, but it does count towards a bank's capital requirements. Investors should note that while this can be a strategic move to strengthen the bank's capital structure, it also implies an increase in debt levels, which could affect the bank's leverage ratios and interest expenses.The mandated capital ratios, such as the Tier 1 leverage ratio and total capital to risk-based assets ratio, are set above typical regulatory minimums, indicating a conservative approach by the regulators. Maintaining these ratios will ensure the bank's stability but may also limit its ability to deploy capital for aggressive growth strategies in the short term. Market Research Analyst The merger's impact on the market positioning of Provident Bank can be substantial, given the complementary strengths of the two banks. This strategic move is likely to enhance customer service and product offerings, providing a competitive edge in the regional banking sector.Furthermore, the commitment to develop an action plan to improve home mortgage applications and originations to all demographic populations could positively affect the bank's image and customer base diversity. This aligns with the broader industry trend towards greater financial inclusion and could potentially open up new market segments for the bank.It's also important to consider the composition of the combined board of directors, with a majority from Provident, which could indicate the direction of the bank's future strategy and governance post-merger. Such board dynamics often influence corporate culture and strategic decisions, which are critical factors for long-term success. Legal Expert The receipt of regulatory approvals with conditions and commitments is a legal milestone in the merger process. The specific capital requirements and ratios set forth are legally binding and failure to comply could result in significant repercussions, including potential regulatory actions.The agreement to maintain certain levels of commercial real estate loans relative to total capital and reserves is indicative of a regulatory environment focused on risk management, especially in the context of a bank's loan portfolio. This is designed to prevent overexposure to high-risk sectors, which is a prudent measure from a legal and regulatory standpoint.Lastly, the obligation to develop an action plan for home mortgage applications underscores the legal emphasis on fair lending practices and the need to adhere to regulations that promote equality in banking services. This is not only a legal requirement but also a strategic imperative in today's socially conscious market. 03/25/2024 - 01:00 PM ISELIN, N.J. and OAK RIDGE, N.J., March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Provident Financial Services, Inc. (NYSE:PFS) (“Provident”), the parent company of Provident Bank, and Lakeland Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq: LBAI) (“Lakeland”), the parent company of Lakeland Bank, today announced receipt of regulatory approvals from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance for Provident and Lakeland to complete their previously announced merger. With these approvals, the only pending regulatory approval required to complete the merger is the approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Upon completion of the merger, the combined company will operate under the Provident name and will benefit from enhanced scale, and opportunities for growth and profitability. Provident’s and Lakeland’s complementary strengths will provide exceptional service to customers and communities served. “We are very pleased to be closer to combining our two great banks to create a top-tier super-community bank. This merger will afford us greater opportunity to serve the financial needs of our customers and communities, and to continue to expand and grow our product offerings,” said Anthony Labozzetta, President and CEO of Provident Bank. “The combination of our two organizations gives me great pride as we bring together top talent and leadership under one team,” said Thomas J. Shara, Lakeland’s President and CEO. The regulatory approvals contain certain conditions and commitments, including that Provident complete a $200 million capital raise prior to completion of the merger. Provident intends to satisfy this condition by raising $200 million of Tier 2 qualifying subordinated debt prior to completing the merger. Further, for a period of three years following completion of the merger, Provident Bank will be required to maintain a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio of at least 8.5% and a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of at least 11.25%. In addition, Provident Bank will maintain its ratio of commercial real estate loans to total capital and reserves at or below the levels set forth in the three-year projections supporting its regulatory applications. Provident Bank will also be obligated to develop an action plan, subject to FDIC approval, to improve home mortgage applications from and originations to all demographic populations within the combined bank’s reasonably expected market area. In connection with these approvals, Provident and Lakeland expect to agree that the combined board of directors will consist of nine directors from Provident and five directors from Lakeland. The two companies also expect to extend their merger agreement to June 30, 2024, to provide time to receive the remaining regulatory approval and to complete the subordinated debt issuance. The merger is expected to be completed in the second calendar quarter, subject to the receipt of approval for the merger from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, completion of the debt issuance and satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

The project aims to cut 14,000 metric tons of carbon emissions annually, moving towards carbon neutrality for factories producing popular brands like Ben & Jerry's and Talenti. Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Sustainability Expert The initiative by Unilever to retrofit its Ice Cream Business Group's factories with electric boilers and industrial heat pumps is a noteworthy step in the food and beverage industry's journey towards environmental sustainability. The projected reduction of 14,000 metric tons of carbon emissions annually aligns with the broader trend of corporate responsibility and the transition to low-carbon operations.Implementing such technologies not only contributes to the company's carbon neutrality goals but also resonates with the increasing consumer demand for environmentally responsible products. This move could potentially enhance Unilever's brand reputation and customer loyalty. Moreover, the support from the U.S. Department of Energy underscores the viability and importance of this project, potentially influencing other companies to undertake similar initiatives.However, the upfront costs and the execution risks associated with the technological upgrades must be managed effectively. While the long-term benefits include energy savings and reduced environmental impact, short-term disruptions and financial implications could affect the business operation and its stakeholders. Financial Analyst Unilever's selection for award negotiations by the U.S. Department of Energy could have a positive impact on its financials, particularly if the $20.9 million support materializes. This financial injection would offset some of the capital expenditures required for the upgrades, potentially improving the company's net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) on the project.From an investor's perspective, the initiative could signal strong future positioning for Unilever in the market, as sustainability becomes increasingly important to consumers. However, investors should monitor the project's progress and its impact on the company's operating margins, as the initial investment and ongoing maintenance costs for the new technology could be significant.It is important to note that while this project could lead to cost savings in the long run, the immediate financial benefits may not be realized in the short term. Investors should consider the balance between long-term sustainability goals and short-term financial performance when evaluating Unilever's stock. Market Research Analyst The decision by Unilever to implement carbon-reducing technologies in its Ice Cream Business Group's U.S. factories could be seen as a strategic move to strengthen its market position. As consumers become more environmentally conscious, companies that proactively address sustainability issues may gain a competitive edge.By setting an example in the food and beverage sector, Unilever could influence consumer perceptions and set industry benchmarks. This project may also spur innovation within the sector, as competitors seek to match or exceed Unilever's sustainability efforts.The potential ripple effect of this initiative could extend beyond immediate carbon emission reductions, fostering a shift towards sustainable practices throughout the industry. However, it is essential to track consumer response to these changes and whether they translate into increased sales or market share for Unilever's brands. 03/25/2024 - 01:12 PM Company selected by U.S. Department of Energy for award negotiations ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Unilever today announced that a major project to significantly reduce carbon emissions at its Ice Cream Business Group’s four U.S. factories has been selected by the U.S. Department of Energy for award negotiations of up to $20.9 million of support. The proposed project would cut 14,000 metric tons of carbon emissions per year, a major step in moving toward carbon neutrality for the factories that produce Ben & Jerry’s, Talenti, Magnum, Breyers and other leading brands.

(Photo: Business Wire) Specifically, Unilever Ice Cream will replace natural gas boilers with electric boilers and industrial heat pumps using waste heat recovery. Unilever reached 100% renewable grid electricity globally in 2020 and is in the process of moving all its workplaces to 100% renewable energy. The facility upgrades will significantly reduce carbon emissions and will create a pathway to address 100% of heat-related process emissions at the factories in Missouri, Tennessee, and Vermont. This project was chosen as a selectee for award negotiations by the U.S. Department of Energy as part of the Industrial Demonstrations Program (IDP) for its potential to reduce emissions, benefit local communities, and serve as a model for further decarbonization throughout the food and beverage sector. “We are making progress to decarbonize our ice cream business, and these substantial upgrades will mean a major cut in emissions,” said Sandeep Desai, Chief Product Supply Chain Officer, Unilever Ice Cream. “This step moves us closer to our sustainability goals and is a significant investment in the future for our business and planet.” Read more about the actions Unilever is taking to tackle climate change in its recently updated Climate Transition Action Plan here: Unilever.com/CTAP.

Announces Final Tender Offer Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, Inc. and The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. announced the final results of the Fund's cash tender offer to purchase up to 10% of its outstanding common shares at 97.5% of the Fund's net asset value. The Fund will purchase 13.615645% of the common shares properly tendered. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The completion of the tender offer by The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund represents a strategic maneuver to optimize its capital structure. By repurchasing 10% of its outstanding shares at a slight discount to NAV, the Fund effectively returns capital to shareholders, potentially leading to an increase in the NAV per remaining share. This could be viewed favorably by investors as it reflects a proactive approach to managing shareholder value.It's also worth noting the significant oversubscription, as evidenced by the pro-ration factor of 13.615645%, which indicates a high level of shareholder participation. This could imply that investors found the offer attractive or that there was a desire for liquidity among shareholders. The repurchase at a discount can be a double-edged sword; while it is accretive to the NAV for remaining shareholders, it also suggests that the Fund's shares were trading at a discount to their NAV, which might raise questions about market perception and underlying asset valuation. Financial Analyst The financial implications of this tender offer are multifaceted. For one, the repurchase of shares at 97.5% of NAV is a common tactic used by funds to manage discounts to NAV. The Fund's ability to conduct such an offer and the subsequent reduction in the number of outstanding shares can lead to a more concentrated ownership and potentially enhance earnings per share for remaining investors.However, the tender offer's impact on the Fund's liquidity should also be considered. The cash outflow required to purchase the tendered shares might reduce the Fund's cash reserves, which could affect its ability to take advantage of future investment opportunities or weather market volatility. Investors should monitor the Fund's subsequent performance and management's strategy to ensure that the reduced share count translates into tangible benefits such as improved financial ratios or performance metrics. Legal Expert From a regulatory standpoint, the tender offer process is governed by the SEC and must adhere to strict disclosure and procedural requirements. The Fund's compliance with these regulations, as indicated by the involvement of EQ Fund Solutions, LLC as the information agent, is essential to ensure the integrity of the transaction. Investors should be aware that such offers are subject to legal review to protect their interests.Furthermore, the pro-rata basis for share repurchase is a standard legal mechanism to ensure fairness among shareholders when the offer is oversubscribed. It prevents selective repurchase and ensures that all participating shareholders are treated equitably. The exclusion of fractional shares is also a common practice to simplify the transaction process. 03/25/2024 - 04:00 PM MIAMI BEACH, Fla., March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Thomas J.

The company will present subset analyses in women, Hispanic/Latinx patients, and patients with obesity, showcasing additional data from the pivotal CLEAR Outcomes trial. Positive None. Negative None. Cardiovascular Research Scientist The acceptance of Esperion's subgroup analyses for presentation at the ACC.24 reflects ongoing research efforts in the cardiovascular field, particularly in the management of high cholesterol through pharmacological interventions. Bempedoic acid, as an ATP citrate lyase inhibitor, offers a novel mechanism of action distinct from statins, which have been the cornerstone of dyslipidemia management. The focus on statin-intolerant populations, including women, Hispanic/Latinx patients and those with obesity, is significant. These groups are often underrepresented in clinical trials and their inclusion can provide insights into the efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid across diverse populations.From a scientific standpoint, the potential impact of this research on clinical practice could be substantial. With cardiovascular disease remaining the leading cause of death globally, advancements in lipid-lowering therapies are essential. The CLEAR Outcomes trial data could influence future guidelines, particularly if the sub-analyses demonstrate significant benefits or identify specific patient populations that could derive greater benefit from bempedoic acid therapy. Healthcare Policy Analyst Esperion's participation in a moderated session discussing payer rejections and out-of-pocket costs is a critical aspect of healthcare delivery. Accessibility and affordability of new medications are key determinants of their real-world impact. Despite clinical efficacy, if bempedoic acid is not adequately covered by insurance providers or is priced out of reach for patients, its potential to improve cardiovascular outcomes will be limited. The discussion on patient access to bempedoic acid therapy could provide valuable information on the current barriers within the healthcare system and potential strategies to overcome them.Moreover, the focus on underserved populations in the CLEAR Outcomes trial aligns with a broader shift in healthcare towards health equity. Addressing disparities in cardiovascular care is not only a moral imperative but also a practical one, as it can lead to better overall health outcomes and reduced long-term healthcare costs. Insights from the trial could inform policymakers and healthcare providers on how to tailor interventions for these specific populations, potentially influencing health policy and resource allocation. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The CLEAR Outcomes trial and subsequent data presentations at ACC.24 could have implications for Esperion's market positioning and stock performance. The pharmaceutical market for cholesterol-lowering drugs is competitive, with established players and numerous generic options available. Esperion's ability to differentiate its products, NEXLETOL and NEXLIZET, hinges on demonstrating clear benefits over existing therapies, especially for statin-intolerant patients.Investors will be closely monitoring the outcomes of these presentations for signals on the drug's market potential. Positive data could lead to increased prescribing by clinicians and, consequently, higher sales revenue for Esperion. Conversely, if the data fails to impress or raises concerns about efficacy or safety in certain populations, it could negatively affect the company's valuation. It is also important to consider the long-term potential of bempedoic acid in the context of ongoing research and development in the lipid management space. 03/25/2024 - 04:00 PM ANN ARBOR, Mich., March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Esperion (NASDAQ: ESPR) today announced the acceptance of three CLEAR (Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic acid, an ACL-Inhibiting Regimen) Outcomes subgroup analyses as poster presentations at the 2024 American College of Cardiology’s Annual Scientific Session (ACC.24) in Atlanta, Georgia. Additionally, the Company will participate in a moderated session in partnership with UT Southwestern Medical Center, host an industry expert theatre, and have a commercial and medical information booth during ACC.24. ""Esperion welcomes the opportunity to showcase additional data from our pivotal CLEAR Outcomes trial at the American College of Cardiology's Annual Scientific Session,"" said JoAnne Foody, MD, Chief Medical Officer for Esperion.

The company operates on multiple exchanges (XPAR, CEUX, TQEX, AQEU) and provides detailed transaction information on its website.","TotalEnergies SE: Disclosure of Transactions in Own Shares Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary TotalEnergies SE (TTE) announces share repurchase transactions totaling EUR 106,863,591.01 from March 18 to March 22, 2024, with daily volumes and prices disclosed. The company operates on multiple exchanges (XPAR, CEUX, TQEX, AQEU) and provides detailed transaction information on its website. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The share repurchase program executed by TotalEnergies SE represents a strategic financial maneuver with direct implications for shareholder value and market perception. When a company buys back its own shares, it typically signals confidence in its financial health and future prospects. Moreover, this action can lead to earnings per share (EPS) accretion, as the number of shares outstanding decreases, potentially making the stock more attractive to investors.By analyzing the volume and the weighted average purchase price, one can infer that the company has allocated a significant amount of capital for these transactions. This could suggest that TotalEnergies is prioritizing shareholder returns in the form of capital gains over other potential investments or debt reduction. However, it is essential to consider the impact on the company's cash reserves and whether this aligns with its long-term strategic goals, such as investing in sustainable energy projects. Market Research Analyst From a market research perspective, TotalEnergies' repurchase activity must be evaluated in the context of the energy sector's dynamics and stock market conditions. Share repurchases can be a response to undervaluation in the market, providing support for the stock price. It also reflects the management's assessment that investing in their own shares will yield a better return than other avenues.It's important to monitor the market's reaction to such buybacks, as they can sometimes be interpreted as a lack of better investment opportunities, which might not align with investors looking for growth through reinvestment in business operations. The timing and scale of the buybacks should be scrutinized to assess whether TotalEnergies is optimizing its capital allocation in line with market trends and shareholder expectations. Economist From an economic standpoint, the repurchase program can be seen as a mechanism for adjusting the capital structure of TotalEnergies. By reducing the number of shares outstanding, the company is effectively increasing its debt-to-equity ratio, assuming debt levels remain constant. This financial leverage can be beneficial in a low-interest-rate environment but might pose risks should interest rates rise or if the company faces unexpected downturns.Additionally, the broader economic implications, such as the opportunity cost of not investing in other sectors or technologies, must be considered. The energy sector is at a crossroads with the transition towards renewable sources and TotalEnergies' allocation of resources to share repurchases should be weighed against the potential benefits of investing in innovation and diversification of its energy portfolio. 03/25/2024 - 01:00 PM PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News: In accordance with the authorization given by the ordinary shareholders’ general meeting on May 26, 2023, to trade on its shares and pursuant to applicable law on share repurchase, TotalEnergies SE (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE) (LEI: 529900S21EQ1BO4ESM68) declares the following purchases of its own shares (FR0000120271) from March 18 to March 22, 2024: Transaction Date Total daily volume (number of shares) Daily weighted average purchase price of shares (EUR/share) Amount of transactions (EUR) Market (MIC Code) 18/03/2024 282,926 62.656966 17,727,284.76 XPAR 18/03/2024 143,124 62.657103 8,967,735.21 CEUX 18/03/2024 29,970 62.657085 1,877,832.84 TQEX 18/03/2024 22,775 62.656132 1,426,993.41 AQEU 19/03/2024 278,013 63.899152 17,764,794.94 XPAR 19/03/2024 139,824 63.901490 8,934,961.94 CEUX 19/03/2024 29,201 63.905247 1,866,097.12 TQEX 19/03/2024 22,439 63.905183 1,433,968.40 AQEU 20/03/2024 281,155 63.192755 17,766,959.03 XPAR 20/03/2024 141,639 63.192643 8,950,542.76 CEUX 20/03/2024 30,094 63.192752 1,901,722.68 TQEX 20/03/2024 21,849 63.192739 1,380,698.15 AQEU 21/03/2024 91,009 63.146038 5,746,857.77 XPAR 21/03/2024 37,878 63.146288 2,391,855.10 CEUX 21/03/2024 8,047 63.146757 508,141.95 TQEX 21/03/2024 5,590 63.145084 352,981.02 AQEU 22/03/2024 79,956 62.912596 5,030,239.53 XPAR 22/03/2024 33,168 62.913836 2,086,726.11 CEUX 22/03/2024 7,096 62.916514 446,455.58 TQEX 22/03/2024 4,780 62.916883 300,742.70 AQEU Total 1,690,533 63.212958 106,863,591.01 Transaction details In accordance with Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 (the Market Abuse Regulation) a full breakdown of the individual trades are disclosed on the TotalEnergies website: https://totalenergies.com/investors/shares-and-dividends/total-shares/info/company-share-transactions About TotalEnergies TotalEnergies is a global multi-energy company that produces and markets energies: oil and biofuels, natural gas and green gases, renewables and electricity.

The focus on accountability and reliability in ad measurement could enhance the perceived value of AudienceXpress's offerings, potentially leading to a stronger competitive position in the market.However, it is important to monitor the execution of this strategy and the market's reception to these new tools. The success of the partnership will hinge on the ability to deliver on the promised innovations and to effectively monetize the enhanced capabilities.

The solution offers faster, more reliable connectivity, reduced costs, and power efficiencies, catering to the evolving needs of AI, cloud, and 5G services. Positive None. Negative None. Telecommunications Analyst The demonstration of the 800ZR solution by Juniper Networks, Coherent Corp. and Marvell Technology Inc. is a significant development in the telecommunications sector. The collaboration between these companies is set to provide a robust solution that addresses the growing demand for high-speed data transmission in various network scenarios, including data center interconnect (DCI), metro and long-haul networks.From a telecommunications perspective, the introduction of 800G technology is a substantial leap forward from the current 400G solutions. The ability to support 800 Gbps of bandwidth for optical connections up to 1,000km and 400Gbps for up to 2,000km with the Marvell Orion DSP is a testament to the technological advancements in optical networking. Furthermore, the reduction in cost and power per bit by 30 percent compared to previous generations signifies a move towards more economically viable and sustainable networking solutions.Coherent Corporation's contribution of an 800G Digital Coherent Optics transceiver that utilizes indium phosphide photonic integrated circuits is noteworthy for its high optical output power, which is important for enabling IP-over-DWDM in DCI and metro/regional networks. This technology allows for the integration of dense optical networks with traditional IP networking, potentially simplifying network architecture and reducing the need for complex optical equipment. Data Center Infrastructure Specialist The 800G solution's impact on data center infrastructure is profound, particularly in the context of AI/ML clusters and hyperscale data centers. As AI and cloud services continue to grow, the demand for high-bandwidth, low-latency interconnects within and between data centers is increasing. The Juniper Networks PTX10002-36QDD Packet Transport Router, with its 28.8 Tbps capacity, is designed to meet these demands by providing dense 100GbE, 400GbE and 800GbE support.Operational simplicity and power efficiency are paramount in environments where space and power are at a premium. The advancements in routing and optical transmission technologies are indicative of a trend towards more streamlined and energy-efficient data center operations. This is especially relevant for companies looking to minimize their carbon footprint while scaling up their data infrastructure.Furthermore, the ability to provide faster and more reliable connectivity directly impacts end-user experiences by enabling seamless access to bandwidth-intensive applications. For businesses, this translates to improved service delivery and the potential for new service offerings that leverage the enhanced network capabilities. Market Research Analyst The market implications of the 800G ZR/ZR+ technology are vast, with projections of Pluggable 800G shipments reaching 500k annually by 2028. This growth trajectory underscores the market's readiness to embrace higher-speed networking solutions. The shift towards smaller, more capable pluggable coherent optics indicates a broader industry trend where traditional, bulky optical equipment is being phased out in favor of more compact, power-efficient solutions.As hyperscalers and telecommunications providers continue to build out their infrastructure, the adoption of 800G technology is expected to accelerate. This will likely drive down costs and create a competitive market for high-speed networking equipment. It is also worth noting the importance of system integration and multivendor collaboration in bringing such technologies to market.

Replay of the call available until April 2, 2024, with access details provided. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The pre-announcement of Bragg Gaming Group's full year 2023 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA reflects a substantial growth trajectory, with a notable 10.4% increase in revenue and a more significant 26.3% rise in Adjusted EBITDA. This performance suggests an effective strategy in scaling operations and improving profitability. Investors may interpret these figures as indicators of strong company management and potential for sustained growth, especially in the context of the competitive B2B gaming technology sector.Furthermore, the Adjusted EBITDA margin improvement implies better cost management and operational efficiency. It's essential to consider how these margins compare to industry averages and whether they can be maintained as the company scales. Investors should also be aware of the capital expenditures that might be required to support further growth and how these could affect future earnings. The timing of this pre-announcement, just ahead of the full earnings release, could be strategically aimed at managing market expectations. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the increase in both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA is a positive signal to the market, potentially impacting Bragg's stock price positively. The Adjusted EBITDA is particularly important as it excludes non-cash expenses, interest, taxes and other one-time charges, providing a clearer picture of the company's operating performance. This metric is often used by investors to gauge a company's ability to generate cash flow and fund operations without the noise of accounting decisions.Analyzing the revenue growth in the context of the gaming industry's current trends, such as the shift towards online platforms and regulatory changes, is critical. Investors should also consider the company's growth in relation to its competitors. If Bragg is outperforming the market, it could suggest a competitive advantage. However, it's also important to look at the sustainability of this growth, taking into account the company's long-term strategy and market conditions. Economist The reported financial performance of Bragg Gaming Group can have broader economic implications, particularly within the tech and gaming industries. A 10.4% year-over-year revenue increase is a positive economic indicator, reflecting not only the company's growth but also suggesting a healthy consumer demand within the sector. The substantial rise in Adjusted EBITDA indicates that the company is not only increasing sales but also becoming more profitable, which is a sign of a maturing business model.However, it is vital to contextualize these figures within the broader economic environment, considering factors such as consumer spending trends, disposable income levels and economic cycles. While the company's performance is strong, external economic pressures, such as inflation or changes in discretionary spending, could impact future growth. Investors should weigh these macroeconomic factors when considering the long-term potential of their investment in Bragg Gaming Group. 03/25/2024 - 10:18 AM RECONFIRMS FULL FINANCIAL RESULTS TO BE RELEASED ON MARCH 26 TORONTO, March 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Bragg Gaming Group Inc.

This strategic collaboration could enhance investor confidence, potentially leading to a positive reaction in the stock market. However, it's important to monitor the outcomes of the study, as any setbacks could adversely affect investor sentiment. Military Medical Expert The collaboration between SAB and the NMRC underscores the military's interest in robust and deployable medical solutions. Influenza poses a threat to military readiness and effectiveness, making the development of a versatile and easily administered prophylactic like SAB-176 particularly relevant. The intramuscular administration could be a game-changer in field conditions, where ease and speed of delivery are paramount.Success in this study would not only benefit the military but could also set a precedent for rapid response mechanisms against other infectious diseases in challenging environments. The potential for SAB-176 to be administered pre- and post-exposure offers a tactical advantage in managing outbreaks and maintaining operational continuity. 03/25/2024 - 10:15 AM SIOUX FALLS, S.D., March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SAB Biotherapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: SABS), (“SAB” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a novel immunotherapy platform that is developing fully-human anti-thymocyte immunoglobulin (hIgG) for delaying the onset or progression of type 1 diabetes (T1D), today announced that the Navy Medical Research Command (NMRC) is moving forward with a safety and tolerability study to evaluate SAB-176, a therapy being investigated for use as a pre- and post-exposure prophylactic treatment for influenza type A and type B, pursuant to the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement that governs the relationship between SAB and the NMRC. With funding for research provided by the Henry Jackson Foundation, this partnership will move forward a pharmacokinetic (PK), safety and tolerability study designed as a double-blinded, randomized study with intramuscular SAB-176 administered to healthy volunteers. The NMRC Clinical Trials Center, located in Bethesda, Maryland, will be conducting this PK study under the leadership of Cmdr. Nehkonti Adams, Director, NMRC Clinical Trials Center. SAB has utilized its proprietary DiversitAb™ platform to manufacture SAB-176, fully human polyclonal antibodies targeting influenza from Transchromosomic (Tc) Bovine™. SAB-176 is a novel multi-target biologic that has shown sustained neutralization activity across multiple virus strains of Influenza A and B. In 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track Designations to SAB-176 based on the results of the completed clinical proof-of-concept Phase 2 study in an influenza challenge model with intravenous (IV) formulation. SAB-176, along with several other fully human anti-infective immunoglobulins developed by SAB have been administered through IV to over 700 healthy volunteers and patients. This will be the first study to examine intramuscular administration of any DiversitAb™ platform product. The DiversitAb™ platform produces fully human target-specific biologics that can be delivered across a range of therapeutic areas, including infectious diseases and autoimmune conditions like type 1 diabetes (T1D). SAB Chairman and CEO Samuel J. Reich stated that “we are pleased to continue our collaboration with the NMRC to explore new routes of administration for our products. While T1D remains our primary focus, studying the novel administration of a therapy using our proprietary platform could have tremendous positive health impacts and is a logical next step for SAB’s other therapeutic products as well.” “It is important to support studies that advance therapeutics that can be feasibly delivered in a deployed setting,” explained Cmdr. Nehkonti Adams, in a recent NMRC press release. “This research could impact thousands of lives, providing the capacity to rapidly respond to influenza and other infectious diseases.” According to the CDC, influenza causes substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide despite available antivirals and vaccines. Influenza is responsible for approximately 226,000 excess hospitalizations and 30,000 to 50,000 deaths each year in the United States alone. Despite the demonstrated reduction in disease rates following vaccination, the efficacy of annual influenza vaccination peaks around 60%. This sub-optimal effect is often due to antigenic drift and mismatches between the vaccine and circulating strains in any given influenza season, thus, one potential solution is to utilize fully human IgG isolated from transchromosomic bovine hyperimmunized with numerous representative influenza strains. About SAB Biotherapeutics, Inc. SAB Biotherapeutics (SAB) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing fully human, multi- targeted, high-potency immunoglobulins (IgGs), without the need for human donors or convalescent plasma, to treat and prevent immune and autoimmune disorders. The Company’s lead asset, SAB-142, targets type 1 diabetes (T1D) with a disease-modifying therapeutic approach that aims to change the treatment paradigm by delaying onset and potentially preventing disease progression. Using advanced genetic engineering and antibody science to develop Transchromosomic (Tc) Bovine™, the only transgenic animal with a human artificial chromosome, SAB’s DiversitAb™ drug development production system is able to generate a diverse repertoire of specifically targeted, high-potency, fully-human IgGs that can address a wide range of serious unmet needs in human diseases without the need for convalescent plasma or human donors.

The partnership aims to redefine the media and technology landscape, focusing on free expression and innovation. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The announcement of TMTG's listing on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbols 'DJT' and 'DJTWW' represents a significant event for the company and its investors. The transition from a private to a public entity typically provides a company with access to a larger pool of capital, which can be instrumental in funding growth initiatives. Additionally, public status can offer increased visibility and credibility in the market.However, the performance of the stock post-listing will be closely watched by investors and could be influenced by a variety of factors, including the company's ability to execute its vision against competitors, its financial performance and broader market conditions. Given the stated goal of TMTG to challenge 'Big Tech censors,' the company's strategy and operations will likely be under intense scrutiny to evaluate its capacity to capture market share in a highly competitive and politically sensitive environment. Technology Industry Analyst TMTG's positioning as an alternative in the media and technology space, with a focus on 'reclaiming the Internet from Big Tech censors,' indicates an attempt to tap into a niche market of users seeking platforms that prioritize free expression. The company's ability to differentiate itself technologically and offer a compelling value proposition will be critical for its success.Furthermore, the leadership under CEO Devin G. Nunes will be a key factor in the company's strategic direction and operational execution. Leadership plays a pivotal role in shaping company culture, driving innovation and navigating regulatory landscapes, which are all important for TMTG's stated mission. Stakeholders will be monitoring the company's product development, user growth and engagement metrics as indicators of long-term viability and competitive edge within the industry. Legal and Regulatory Expert The legal and regulatory environment for media and technology companies is complex, particularly for a company like TMTG that aims to challenge the status quo of content moderation and free speech on the Internet. The company's approach to these issues will have to balance user freedom with legal compliance, including adherence to regulations related to data privacy, cybersecurity and potentially contentious content.Legal advisors, such as Paul Hastings LLP and Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough LLP, play significant roles in guiding companies through the regulatory landscape. For TMTG, navigating these waters will be essential to avoid potential legal challenges that could impact its business operations and stock performance. Investors will need to consider the company's regulatory risk profile and how it aligns with their investment strategies and risk tolerance. 03/25/2024 - 11:30 AM TMTG to Begin Trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC on Tuesday, March 26, 2024 Under the Ticker Symbol ""DJT""MIAMI, FL and SARASOTA, FL / ACCESSWIRE / March 25, 2024 / Digital World Acquisition Corp.

The collection of interviews highlights the need for industry-wide transparency and integrity to meet the expected increase in global demand for aesthetics treatments. The global medical aesthetics industry is set to grow faster than ever before, with 23 million dermal filler and 14.6 million body procedures predicted by 2025.1 With the influx of new practitioners and patients, trusted information, and education to ensure high ethical standards is more important than ever. ""We are at a unique moment in the evolution of our industry, and we must ensure that ethics is front and center in our minds and in our clinical practice,"" says world renowned aesthetic surgeon Dr Mauricio de Maio. ""A coordinated effort is needed to reconsider the guiding principles of ethics, ensuring patient safety is prioritized."" Over ninety percent of practitioners (91%) believe those providing medical aesthetic procedures should be guided by ethical standards.2 As part of the Aesthetics-Ethics program, Allergan Aesthetics engaged in extensive global research, including global social media listening, insight gathering and face-to-face discussions across the industry in 13 countries3 to better understand the ethical environment and key topics in the industry today and into the future. Bringing together industry voices to discuss ethics Based on the research findings, the Moving the Needle on Ethics Book further examines the ethical landscape of aesthetic medicine and elevates the role and impact of ethical excellence across a range of scenarios including consultation, social media, training and education, product quality and patient care. The aim is to support patient safety and positive outcomes. ""The goal of this research is to raise the subject of ethics in aesthetics to a new, more transparent level by sharing data from those who participate in it every day,"" says Carrie Strom, President, Global Allergan Aesthetics. ""Recognizing that ethics plays a key role in aesthetics and elevating that conversation is critical for the success of this growing, healthy market and delivering safe aesthetic outcomes for patients.""

The technology encrypts fingerprint data, stored only on the card, providing better protection against hackers. It also prevents duplication of fingerprints. The card offers quick payments without the need for a PIN, improving checkout speed and reducing the risk of forgetting or losing the PIN. Positive None. Negative None. 03/25/2024 - 01:29 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SmartMetric, Inc. (OTC: SMME) A fingerprint scan credit card is a type of biometric card that uses a built-in fingerprint scanner to verify the identity of the cardholder when they try to make a payment. This technology is designed to enhance the security and convenience of credit card transactions, especially for contactless payments as well as standard contact payments and ATM transactions. Better protection of your data: Unlike PINs, fingerprint data is encrypted and is only stored in the card, bypassing the need for a central database connected to the internet, protecting a card user’s sensitive data from hackers1. Additionally, the technology safeguards against duplicated 2D and rubber fingerprints because it requires electrical capacitive sensing. In addition, the SmartMetric biometric credit/debit card has an inbuilt hardware based live fingerprint detection created by SmartMetric and only available on the SmartMetric biometric credit/debit card. Even more convenience: Credit cards save consumers time and allow them to pay quickly. With a fingerprint scan credit card, you don’t need to remember or enter a PIN, which can speed up the checkout process and reduce the risk of forgetting or losing your PIN. At the moment the card issuing brands such as Visa and Mastercard are not proposing to eliminate the use of a PIN with a biometric card. Discussion in Europe by Banking regulators is actively talking about the doing away with the widely accepted “insecure” PIN when users use a fingerprint scan credit/debit card. Credit card networks already have the ability to turn off PIN usage which they do for some low-cost transactions such as buying a coffee. Logic would have it as biometric credit cards proliferate non-PIN usage will expand without restriction to fingerprint biometric scan cards. Works with existing POS infrastructure: SmartMetric fingerprint scan credit cards are compatible with existing point-of-sale terminals that accept chip or contactless payments, so merchants don’t need to invest in new equipment or software to accept them. However, more recent players who are trying to test reader powered finger scan credit cards that rely on the power from the reader are trapped in having their cards not able to work at most Gas Stations, ATM’s and many restaurants that don’t have portable card readers that are brought to the table. Non-Self Powered Fingerprint Scan Cards (limited use credit cards) Only works when inserted into a card reader therefore limiting use of the card and not able to be used in all card user situations. These cards rely on the user touching the cards fingerprint sensor while the other end of the card with the contact chip is held in the reader. This allows the card to power the fingerprint scan only through the power from the card reader going into the card. So these cards are limited to readers that only partially insert the card into a reader. Otherwise, they have no power of their own to perform a fingerprint scan. Some of the places these none-powered cards will NOT work in are: ATM’s that swallow the card whole Restaurants that do not have a portable card reader but require the card to be taken from the table for transaction processing Gas station pumps that like ATM’s swallow the card whole Transit ticket dispensers that swallow the card whole Parking station ticket machines that swallow the card whole Non-Self Powered finger scan credit or debit cards require the user to go to a bank branch to have their fingerprint scanned and then transferred onto the card via a secure fingerprint capture device. This is bothersome to the card user. It raises trust issues about having the bank involved in the capture of the user’s fingerprint. For large scale credit issuers that rely on mass mailing of new and replacement credit cards requiring their customers to have to come into a bank branch just will not work. SmartMetric Self Powered Finger Scan Card The SmartMetric self-powered finger scan card because it has its own internal rechargeable power, scans the cared user’s finger prior to the card being inserted into a credit card reader. Therefore, the card is able to be used at all existing and types of credit card readers without the stark limitations of the non-self-powered fingerprint scan cards. The SmartMetric self-powered finger scan card does not require the card user to go into a bank branch to register their fingerprint on the card. Nor does it alternatively need a separate secure card reading device to be sent out to the card user for in home fingerprint download into the card. The SmartMetric finger scan card user simply touches the cards fingerprint sensor four (4) times an instantly their fingerprint is scanned and securely stored inside the card. No user friction. Instant fingerprint capture and store because the card is self-powered and acts immediately as a fingerprint scanner. Mass credit card issuers who rely on mail distribution for the credit cards need not to change the way they do business. SmartMetric finger scan cards are easily shipped to homes through the mail and without fuss or user friction are easily set up for future card use by the user’s fingerprint. The SmartMetric self-powered finger scan card works at ALL card readers such as: ATM’s Restaurants that take the card from the table to process (user touches the sensor which turns on the card for up to 8 minutes giving the table server enough time to have the card processed) Gas pumps Parking ticket vending machines Transit ticket vending machines “Because of the limitations of the user and card issuer experience we believe that trials and testing of the non-self-powered cards under way in Europe are doomed to failure. Much like inferior electric vehicles are failing in the market while Tesla continues to grow exponentially with its model Y becoming the biggest selling vehicle globally. Failed poorly thought-out products fail because no one wants them while it doesn’t distract from new innovations success trajectory when the new innovators get the product to align with customers expectations,” said SmartMetric’s President and CEO, Chaya Hendrick. It has taken years of research and development to perfect the internal power system within the SmartMetric finger scan card. Millions of dollars in research and development have been invested to create the only card of its kind in the world that will work at all card readers. A card that is simple to download your fingerprint into the card at home without the fear and inconvenience of going somewhere else to have your fingerprint scanned and stored into the card. The SmartMetric finger scan card is light years ahead and brings the reality of full biometric security technology to the ubiquitous credit and debit card world. Credit cards still dominate the way consumer make payments. Non credit card payments such as phones account for less than 5% of payment transactions while the majority of transactions are done using either a credit or debit card. According to a report published by Forbes Adviser on March 9, 2023 “Over the past year, nearly half the population (47.5%) opened at least one new account, bringing the total number of accounts to over 518 million by the end of 2022.” 1 The mass market version of the SmartMetric Gen4 biometric credit card is now under manufacture following the successful testing of the cards new and advanced internal operating system on the new card hardware platform.

Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The expanded partnership between Instacart and AWG is a strategic move that taps into the growing trend of e-commerce within the grocery sector. As consumers increasingly seek convenience in their shopping experiences, the integration of AI-powered smart carts and the extension of same-day delivery services cater to this demand. The collaboration could potentially increase market penetration for Instacart and strengthen customer loyalty for AWG's member retailers.From a business perspective, the adoption of these technologies may lead to operational efficiencies, such as reduced checkout times and improved inventory management. However, it is essential to monitor how the implementation of such technologies will impact the labor force within these stores, as the demand for traditional cashier roles may evolve.Overall, the partnership could enhance competitive positioning for both Instacart and AWG member companies, but careful execution and customer adoption rates will be key determinants of success. Retail Technology Expert The integration of Caper Carts into AWG's retail environment is a notable advancement in retail technology. These smart carts leverage computer vision and AI to streamline the shopping process, potentially reducing wait times at checkout and enhancing the overall customer experience. The ability to link loyalty accounts and receive personalized promotions can lead to increased customer engagement and spending.However, the success of this technology will depend on consumer acceptance and the effectiveness of the AI in accurately identifying a wide range of products. Additionally, the infrastructure and staff training required to maintain these smart carts will be important factors in realizing their benefits.While this technology is promising, its impact on sales and customer satisfaction should be assessed regularly to ensure it aligns with the business objectives of AWG's member retailers. Financial Analyst The financial implications of the partnership between Instacart and AWG could be significant. By expanding the reach to an additional 2,300 member retailer locations, Instacart is likely to see an increase in its revenue stream from the service fees and commissions associated with online orders and deliveries.For AWG member retailers, the upfront investment in smart cart technology and the fees paid to Instacart for e-commerce services need to be balanced against the potential uplift in sales volumes and customer retention. The long-term financial health of this initiative will hinge on the scalability of the solution and the ability to maintain cost efficiencies.Investors should watch for key performance indicators such as user adoption rates, average order values and frequency of orders to gauge the success of the partnership and its impact on the bottom line for both Instacart and AWG. 03/25/2024 - 01:14 PM Partnership enables more direct access to same-day delivery and AI-powered smart carts to AWG member companies across 3,500 locations in 32 states SAN FRANCISCO and KANSAS CITY, Kan., March 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Instacart (Nasdaq: CART), the leading grocery technology company in North America, and Associated Wholesale Grocers, Inc.

Negative None. 03/25/2024 - 11:30 AM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 25, 2024 / Subaru of America, Inc.By Genevieve BookwalterSubaru partners with Leave No Trace to send teams across the U.S. in a Subaru, providing hands-on training for how to reduce one's impact when recreating outdoors.Most nights of the year, Becca and Luke McGraw sleep in a tent perched on top of their Subaru Outback Wilderness, typically parked at a campsite in a beautiful natural setting. But sometimes, depending on where work takes them, they might sleep on top of their vehicle parked in the lot of a Cabela's® outdoor supply store or take advantage of an Airbnb to do some laundry.The married couple make up one of three Leave No Trace Traveling Teams, which road trip across the United States teaching outdoor enthusiasts the best ways to enjoy trails and trees while also preserving the resources for others to enjoy. Their reach stretches coast to coast and anywhere from urban parks to the nation's vast wilderness areas. Former teachers, the McGraws love being outside and applied for the job on a whim during the pandemic. Now, they reach the growing and diverse numbers of hikers, campers, dog walkers and others who cultivated a love for the outdoors during the pandemic and continue to enjoy it.They also delight in showing others how a person with a disability can both lead and enjoy the outdoors. Luke McGraw says he has about 30% vision, and Becca does all the driving.Public lands are ""getting much more engagement from people who have not traditionally spent time outdoors - especially people of color, people with disabilities, all sorts of people who have not traditionally spent time outside. We're seeing a lot more engagement and a lot more participation,"" Luke says.How It All Got StartedBased in Boulder, Colorado, Leave No Trace began unofficially in 1987 with a pamphlet to instruct those traveling in federally owned wilderness and backcountry about how to do so with minimum impacts on the land. The program grew in the early 1990s when the National Outdoor Leadership School was asked to develop training for nonmotorized recreation. In 1993, Leave No Trace formed as an independent organization, incorporating in 1994.Five years later, Subaru became a Leave No Trace partner, working together with the organization to create the Traveling Trainer Program. Since then, Leave No Trace trainers have reached more than 220 million people in 49 states nationwide.Leave No Trace PrinciplesPlan Ahead and PrepareTravel and Camp on Durable SurfacesDispose of Waste ProperlyLeave What You FindMinimize Campfire ImpactsRespect WildlifeBe Considerate of Other Visitors© Leave No Trace: www.LNT.orgLeave No Trace TrainingIn addition to the education offered by Traveling Teams, Leave No Trace offers free online education. The introductory LNT 101 Course provides 47 lessons, and their Backcountry Course consists of 39 lessons, including a 101 Course Recap. There are also in-person courses for instructor training and a Youth Program Accreditation. As for the McGraws, ""They've completed the newest, latest and greatest Leave No Trace training,"" says Faith Overall, community engagement manager for Leave No Trace. The couple is currently driving across the U.S. leading events from a Girl Scout program to a ""communication workshop with land managers to teach them how to talk to visitors."" What Do Traveling Teams Do?Traveling Trainer Teams road trip across the country in their Subaru vehicles providing hands-on educational training, workshops and outreach programs for children and adults.The teams visit big festivals, Subaru WinterFest events and camp more than 250 nights of the year, Overall says. A local Colorado artist designed the wrap that encompasses and decorates the vehicles that each team occupies for about nine months. Their outreach is important, Overall says, as community leaders and land managers ask Leave No Trace to help them reach the influx of new visitors who got active outside for the first time during or after the pandemic. ""The majority of folks don't want to create impacts outdoors - they just don't understand how their behaviors are causing impacts,"" Overall says. ""Even some folks who are seasoned. I run into people who have been outdoors their whole life, and I have to tell them to pick up their dog poop.""Some visitors might be taking up a new activity, such as hikers who start rock climbing, and need to learn best practices for that hobby, e.g., how to scale a rock with minimal impact to the stone. Or maybe they know Leave No Trace practices for a rainy deciduous forest and then visit the Utah desert and need to learn the least invasive spots to urinate and pitch a tent, Overall says.Leave No Trace works with the biggest federal land management agencies in the United States, including the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Park Service.In 2007, leaders partnered with the National Association of State Park Directors. Now, efforts stretch far beyond the backcountry to reach those walking on a neighborhood rail trail, to mountain biking in a county park, to running trails on BLM land.The two-person Traveling Teams host multiday Spotlight events, focusing on community conservation and education in popular outdoor destinations, and lead multiday programs at designated Hot Spots, popular outdoor areas that have been overused but still can be restored.A Former Advocate Reports BackGillian Rossi, parks and recreation director for the city of Manitou Springs, Colorado, says she served as a LNT Colorado state advocate for more than two years. The lessons she learned have helped her in her current job and her previous position with the city of Colorado Springs. ""It's really important to not come off like you're shaming people or yelling at them, nothing negative,"" Rossi says. ""That's the reason I like to go with the LNT model. It's all about positivity and giving people the benefit of the doubt. No one is outside to maliciously harm our parks and outdoor spaces. They just don't have the experience and knowledge of how to take care of them sometimes.""In both communities she reached out to the local parks friends' groups for help putting the practices in place. In turn, those groups began doing trail work and cleaning up dog feces and trash. She said she's still learning new things from Leave No Trace.""It's what you don't see that kind of speaks the loudest,"" Rossi says. ""You notice when things are out of place or if there's a complaint or if a park has been destroyed by a large group. When the park looks great, sometimes it just blends into the background.""ABOUT THE AUTHORGenevieve Bookwalter is a freelance writer based in Chicago.

ATSG's commitment to expanding its global leasing network showcases its dedication to serving e-commerce integrators and express carriers. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The delivery of a newly converted Boeing 767-300 freighter by Air Transport Services Group, Inc. (ATSG) to My Freighter Cargo Airlines represents a strategic move to expand its global footprint, particularly in Central and Southeast Asia. This region has been experiencing growth in e-commerce, which in turn drives demand for air freight services. The choice of the Boeing 767-300 model aligns with industry preferences for mid-sized, fuel-efficient aircraft capable of supporting the logistics of e-commerce and express carriers.ATSG's Lease+Plus strategy, which combines dry-leasing with aviation services, appears to be a competitive approach that could potentially secure long-term customer relationships and recurring revenue streams. By catering to the specific needs of freight markets with a tailored solution, ATSG is likely positioning itself as a partner of choice for emerging airlines like My Freighter Cargo Airlines. Financial Analyst ATSG's announcement of its fourth Boeing 767-300 freighter delivery this year is a positive indicator of the company's operational execution and ability to meet targets as per its fourth quarter investor release. The expansion of their relationship with My Freighter Cargo Airlines may be seen as a testament to the company's market penetration strategies and customer satisfaction levels. This could bode well for ATSG's future financial performance, given the high capital costs associated with aircraft conversions and the need for a strong lease portfolio to drive return on investment.Investors should note the potential for increased revenue through the Lease+Plus strategy, which may enhance ATSG's profitability by offering a combination of leasing and value-added services. However, it is important to monitor how the company manages the capital expenditures for conversions and the utilization rates of its aircraft, as these factors will significantly impact financial outcomes. Aviation Industry Expert The focus on the Boeing 767-300 freighter by ATSG underscores the aircraft's enduring relevance in the air cargo industry. Its operational flexibility and efficiency are key for building robust air networks, especially for e-commerce and express delivery services. This aircraft model, with its mid-range capacity and operating cost, fits well into the current trend where airlines are optimizing for more frequent deliveries over shorter routes, a model that e-commerce giants are increasingly dependent on.ATSG's strategic emphasis on emerging markets like Central and Southeast Asia is indicative of where the next wave of growth in the air cargo sector is expected. These markets show significant potential due to their growing middle-class populations and increased internet penetration, which are catalysts for e-commerce. ATSG's proactive approach in these regions could secure early-mover advantages, but it also requires careful navigation of regulatory environments and infrastructure challenges that are often present in emerging markets. 03/25/2024 - 02:01 PM WILMINGTON, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Air Transport Services Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATSG) announced today that it has delivered a newly converted Boeing 767-300 freighter to My Freighter Cargo Airlines of Tashkent, Uzbekistan. This delivery marks ATSG’s fourth newly converted Boeing 767-300 dry-lease delivery this year, as outlined in its fourth quarter investor release on February 26, 2024. ATSG's subsidiary, Airborne Global Leasing, executed this delivery in alignment with ATSG's Lease+Plus strategy, which provides freighter capacity and associated aviation services to meet demand within established and emerging global freight markets. “Our expanding relationship with My Freighter exemplifies the tangible value of our Lease+Plus strategy,” said Paul Chase, chief commercial officer of ATSG. “The Boeing 767-300 continues to be the freighter of choice among e-commerce integrators and express carriers as it provides the operational flexibility and efficiency to build those networks.” ATSG continues to focus on global market opportunities in Central and Southeast Asia to enhance its global leasing network.

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 34.9% decrease in revenue and significant drop in net income for J-Long Group Limited is a red flag for investors, indicating a potential contraction in the company's market share or operational challenges. The decline in sales of heat transfers, which was only partially offset by an increase in sales of other products, suggests a shift in product demand or competitive pressures that need to be closely monitored. Additionally, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, particularly due to higher payroll and rental fees, raises concerns about cost management and the scalability of the company's business model in the current economic climate. From a liquidity standpoint, while the company has a positive working capital ratio, the relatively low cash position of US$768,159 could limit its ability to navigate short-term obligations without resorting to additional financing or operational adjustments. The gearing ratio of 18.3% provides some insight into the company's leverage and financial risk, which appears moderate but warrants caution given the declining profitability. Market Research Analyst The apparel trims solution sector is highly competitive and subject to rapid shifts in consumer preferences and technological advancements. J-Long Group's performance needs to be contextualized within industry trends, such as the rise of sustainable materials and digital supply chain solutions. The significant reduction in heat transfer sales could be indicative of broader market trends away from traditional trims towards innovative, eco-friendly alternatives. It's important for the company to adapt its product portfolio to align with these trends to maintain relevance and market share. Furthermore, the Hong Kong market has been facing unique challenges, including political unrest and the impact of global trade tensions, which may have contributed to the company's performance. Investors should consider these external factors when evaluating the company's outlook and strategic direction. Tax Consultant The decrease in income tax expense aligns with the lower net income, reflecting a reduced tax burden due to declining profits. This is a straightforward consequence of the company's financial performance, as most tax jurisdictions calculate corporate tax based on profitability. However, investors should note that while a lower tax expense may provide some short-term relief, it is not a sustainable strategy for profitability. The company must address the underlying causes of the revenue decrease to improve its financial health and tax planning strategy in the long term. 03/25/2024 - 11:11 AM HONG KONG, March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- J-Long Group Limited (“JL” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: JL), JL conducts its primary operations of apparel trims solution services in Hong Kong, today announced its unaudited financial results for the six months ended September 30, 2023.

The acquisition validates the value of NIMML's TITAN-X Precision Medicine platform in discovering immunoregulatory therapeutics for autoimmune diseases. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The acquisition of Landos Biopharma by AbbVie represents a significant event in the biopharmaceutical sector, indicating a strategic move by AbbVie to bolster its portfolio in the inflammatory and autoimmune disease space. This is particularly relevant given AbbVie's established presence in the market with other inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatments.The clinical data showcasing omilancor's remission rates in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, significantly higher than the placebo group, suggests a potential competitive advantage in terms of efficacy. This could translate into a considerable market share in the UC treatment landscape, which is of interest to stakeholders and investors. However, it's important to scrutinize the long-term safety profile and the outcome of the Phase 3 trials to assess the sustainability of this competitive edge.Furthermore, the utilization of NIMML's TITAN-X A.I. platform for precision medicine highlights a growing trend in drug development, where A.I. technologies are leveraged to streamline the discovery and development process. This could have a ripple effect on R&D efficiency and costs across the industry. The focus on precision biomarkers may also lead to more personalized treatment options for patients, which could be a differentiating factor in a crowded market. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The strategic acquisition of NX-13 by AbbVie is a clear indicator of the company's commitment to expanding its immunology portfolio. Given the high unmet need in the autoimmune therapeutic area, the introduction of novel therapeutics like NX-13 and omilancor could address gaps in current treatment regimens and potentially improve patient outcomes.From a market perspective, the successful integration of NX-13 into AbbVie's product line could enhance the company's market capitalization and investor confidence, especially if the treatment can capture a significant portion of the UC market. This is reinforced by the promising Phase 2 data for omilancor, which, if replicated in Phase 3, could disrupt current treatment paradigms.Investors should also note the broader implications of A.I.-powered platforms in drug discovery, as demonstrated by NIMML's TITAN-X. The efficiency gains from such platforms could lead to a faster time-to-market for new drugs and potentially lower R&D costs, which would be favorable for the bottom line of companies like AbbVie and NImmune Biopharma. Biotech Patent Attorney The intellectual property strategy surrounding the development of NX-13 and the LANCL2 agonists is a critical aspect of this acquisition. The ownership of patents by the NIMML founders and their role in the discovery and development of these compounds underscores the importance of robust patent portfolios in the biotech industry.The exclusive targeting of NLRX1 by NX-13 as a novel mechanism of action presents a valuable proposition in terms of patentability and market exclusivity. This could afford AbbVie a significant period of market protection, which is a key consideration for investors looking at the long-term profitability of the acquisition. Ensuring the enforceability and defense of these patents will be vital in maintaining a competitive advantage in the marketplace.Moreover, the precision medicine collaboration and the development of biomarker-driven therapeutics point towards a future where patent strategies might also encompass diagnostic methods and personalized treatment protocols, potentially expanding the scope of intellectual property in the field. 03/25/2024 - 12:40 PM NIMML founders Dr. Bassaganya-Riera, Dr. Hontecillas, and scientific director Dr. Leber discovered, characterized, and led the development of NX-13 from discovery to successful clinical testing in Ulcerative Colitis (UC) patients. NIMML’s TITAN-X, an A.I. powered precision medicine platform, has also guided the target discovery and biomarker-driven development of first and best in class LANCL2 agonists, including omilancor, in Phase 3 development as a once daily, gut-restricted oral therapeutic in Ulcerative Colitis by NImmune Biopharma. Novel scientific discoveries made by the NIMML Institute team continue to yield novel druggable targets for autoimmune diseases and strengthen a global pipeline for safer and more effective oral I&I therapeutics. BLACKSBURG, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The NIMML Institute (“NIMML”), a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit institute dedicated to the discovery of novel precision medicines for autoimmune diseases, today recognized its co-founders, Dr. Josep Bassaganya-Riera and Dr. Raquel Hontecillas, and scientific director Dr. Andrew Leber for their leadership in the discovery and development of NX-13 that enabled today’s acquisition of Landos Biopharma, Inc. (“Landos”) by AbbVie, Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) (“AbbVie”). Dr. Bassaganya-Riera founded Landos in 2017 and led the Company’s subsequent growth from inception through multiple rounds of private funding, a successful IPO, growth as a NASDAQ-listed biopharma company with market capitalization in excess of $625 million, 7 INDs and 17 therapeutic development programs, including the successful clinical development of NX-13 and omilancor for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) and potentially other autoimmune diseases. “NIMML’s TITAN-X Precision Medicine platform and its advanced A.I. and computational modeling capabilities were instrumental for the characterization of NLRX1 as a therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases and the development of NX-13. The acquisition of Landos and NX-13 by AbbVie, the maker of several blockbuster IBD drugs, validates the value of the TITAN-X platform to discover a portfolio of first and best in class biomarker-driven immunoregulatory therapeutics for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases with high unmet patient needs,” said Dr. Bassaganya-Riera, President and CEO of NIMML. “Importantly, AbbVie is one of the world’s largest biopharma companies with an incredibly successful I&I franchise that it has built over the last two decades. This transaction is a tremendous validation of the work and dedication of the entire NIMML team and the robustness of the TITAN-X drug discovery platform in strengthening a global pipeline of I&I therapeutics.” Drs. Bassaganya-Riera, Hontecillas and Leber were the sole inventors of NX-13 and first designed the small molecule to target NLRX1 in 2017. After discovery, the three accelerated the de-risking of NX-13 preclinically, including translational target engagement and multiple mouse models (published in the Journal of Immunology), and a novel proprietary pig model of IBD previously developed by Drs. Bassaganya-Riera and Hontecillas, following the same path that was used to develop omilancor. With this robust data package, the team opened INDs for NX-13 in UC and Crohn’s disease (CD) and successfully completed a Phase I study in normal healthy volunteers. Prior to their departure from Landos, Drs. Bassaganya-Riera, Hontecillas and Leber designed, initiated, and conducted a Phase Ib study in UC patients for NX-13, which has yielded the only clinical efficacy results released to the public to date. In addition to Landos Biopharma, Dr. Bassaganya-Riera founded NImmune Biopharma (“NImmune”) with the purpose to advance the clinical development of the LANCL2 portfolio of immunoregulatory precision medicines. NImmune is led by Dr. Bassaganya-Riera as the Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Hontecillas as the Chief Scientific Officer, and Dr. Leber as the Chief Development Officer. In May 2023, the NIMML Institute executed a precision medicine research collaboration with NImmune to develop the LANCL2 portfolio of immunoregulatory therapeutics, including omilancor and NIM-1324, oral, once-daily agonistic therapeutics that bind and activate the LANCL2 pathway. Omilancor is currently in a global registration-directed Phase 3 program to treat UC. Final and complete Phase 2 data published on October 2023 at ACG showed that once daily omilancor induced a best-in-class remission rate of 30.4% in UC patients versus 3.7% in the placebo arm (P=0.01) with an unrivaled safety profile. NIM-1324 is anticipated to begin a Phase 2 program in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) patients during 2H’24. NIM-1324 is also in clinical development for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and other systemic autoimmune diseases. Both omilancor and NIM-1324 are guided by precision biomarkers discovered and developed by NIMML’s TITAN-X A.I.-powered Precision Medicine platform. “Today’s transaction reinforces the novel immunoregulatory target discovery programs of the NIMML Institute, including LANCL2 and NLRX1, as well as the strong efficacy and safety profile of the innovative therapeutics we continue to develop at NImmune,” said Dr. Hontecillas, Co-Director and Chief Scientific Officer at NIMML. “The acquisition of NX-13 by one of the world’s leading biopharma companies signals continued momentum behind the important work we are doing to advance the development of effective treatments that can safely address the significant unmet clinical needs of millions of patients living with autoimmune diseases.” Crucial to the development of NX-13, the NIMML team first characterized the key role of NLRX1 – a mitochondria-associated receptor involved in down-regulating inflammation – in the protection from IBD. NLRX1 modulates epithelial cell metabolism and the gut microbiota, which was demonstrated through seminal publications of immunology studies conducted by Dr. Bassaganya-Riera’s team, finding deficiency of NLRX1 worsens inflammatory responses in both CD4+ T cells and epithelial cells and shifts the metabolic preferences of cells. The NIMML team identified transdisciplinary mechanisms of NLRX1 anti-inflammatory effects whereby the regulation of lactate metabolism by NLRX1 aids in the prevention of effector T cell responses and the regulation of glutamine metabolism aids in the maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity. These immunometabolic findings laid the groundwork for Dr. Bassaganya-Riera’s team’s clinical development of NX-13 as a novel NLRX1 agonist oral therapy for the treatment of UC. About Omilancor By activating the LANCL2 pathway and modulating the interactions between immunological and metabolic signals in immune and epithelial cells, omilancor is a first-in-class, oral, once-daily, gut restricted therapeutic designed to create a favorable regulatory microenvironment in the gut, decreasing the production of key inflammatory mediators and increasing anti-inflammatory functions in regulatory T cells (Treg) within the site of inflammation. Omilancor has completed Phase 2 clinical testing in UC patients showing a clinical remission of 30.4% with a placebo-adjusted 12-week clinical remission rate of 26.7% (p=0.01) for the 440 mg dose.

(NASDAQ: WIMI) (""WiMi"" or the ""Company""), a leading global Hologram Augmented Reality (""AR"") Technology provider, today announced that it developed a lightweight software architecture for payment systems on a blockchain multiplexing platform. Through multiplexing, and real-time exchange rate processing, it provides users and merchants with a more flexible, convenient and secure payment experience. This payment system is expected to revolutionize cross-cryptocurrency payments. WiMi named it, MultiChainPay Hub. The system works with a number of crypto blockchain networks to support cross-cryptocurrency payments. Where the buyer can pay in one currency and the seller automatically receives another currency of his/her choice. This maximizes the convenience of the buyer and thus increases sales. With the built-in cryptocurrency exchange, cross-cryptocurrency payments can be processed using real-time exchange rates so that both the buyer and seller receive the cryptocurrency of their choice. To ensure that payments are fast, efficient and secure, MultiChainPay Hub's lightweight software architecture includes five key steps. Payment initialization: The buyer initiates checkout on the shopping platform, which sends the offer to the MultiChainPay Hub on the merchant's cryptocurrency blockchain network. The Hub records the offer on a smart contract, which then generates a cross-chain transaction message to be sent to the cryptocurrency network of the buyer's choice. Request messaging: Through internal messaging routers and bridges, messages are passed between different cryptocurrency networks to eventually reach the recipient. Payment execution: Sub-component that handles payment creation and recording, and generates an invoice to send to the buyer on the corresponding smart contract. Payments are processed through MultiChainPay Hub's cryptocurrency exchange. Response messaging: Similar to request messaging, response messages are passed through the paths of different cryptocurrency networks to ensure that they eventually reach the original network. Messages are deserialized and delivered for finalization. Payment confirmation: By updating the relevant offer record on the smart contract, the MultiChainPay Hub sends a new message containing a copy of the relevant deposited funds and proof of purchase. This signals that the payment is complete and the merchant can withdraw the money. WiMi's MultiChainPay Hub has a built-in cryptocurrency exchange that ensures accurate cross-cryptocurrency payments through real-time exchange rate processing. The cryptocurrency exchange deposits the converted net amount into the merchant's account, which is hosted on the native cryptocurrency blockchain network. The MultiChainPay Hub makes e-commerce payments easier by realizing the goal of buyers paying in one cryptocurrency and sellers having the option of another cryptocurrency. MultiChainPay Hub solves the problem of cross-cryptocurrency payments during transactions through its unique lightweight software architecture and multiplexing. Multiplexing: MultiChainPay Hub allows payments between different cryptocurrency networks through multiplexing. This allows buyers and sellers to choose cryptocurrencies respectively, simplifying payments to the greatest extent possible. Real-time exchange rate processing: Built-in cryptocurrency exchanges and real-time exchange rate processing ensure accuracy when paying across cryptocurrencies. This mechanism provides buyers and sellers with real-time market prices, reducing the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Lightweight software architecture: MultiChainPay Hub utilizes a lightweight software architecture that makes it easy to integrate into a variety of e-commerce systems. This design reduces system complexity, increases platform flexibility, and reduces the overall system burden. Automated payment process: MultiChainPay Hub eliminates the need for human intervention from payment initialization to final confirmation. This automated process increases payment efficiency. Payment system integration: MultiChainPay Hub is designed to be easily compatible with different e-commerce platforms. Its ability to adapt to a variety of technical differences and protocols makes it easy for merchants to use the payment system for e-commerce. WiMi's MultiChainPay Hub is expected to play an increasingly important role in the digital payment space. First, it will provide users and merchants with a more convenient, secure and efficient payment experience through continuous innovation and function expansion. And it will continue to optimize the platform to meet the evolving demand for digital payments, thereby gaining a larger share of the market. Secondly, MultiChainPay Hub is expected to become one of the preferred payment solutions for global e-commerce platforms. With the increasing demand for digital payments, multiplexing will enable merchants to accept multiple cryptocurrencies more flexibly, increasing the convenience and flexibility of global commerce. We will work with major e-commerce platforms to drive the promotion and adoption of MultiChainPay Hub globally. Finally, the successful application of MultiChainPay Hub will inject new vitality into the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. By facilitating the widespread use of cryptocurrencies in e-commerce, it is expected to accelerate the adoption and promotion of digital currencies. We look forward to seeing MultiChainPay Hub contribute to driving the innovation and development of future digital payments, creating a more open, convenient and intelligent payment ecosystem for users and merchants. MultiChainPay Hub marks an innovation in the field of e-commerce payment, bringing an unprecedented payment experience to users and merchants. Through multiplexing, real-time exchange rate processing and other advanced technologies, it successfully solves many challenges in cross-cryptocurrency payments and creates new possibilities for wider application of cryptocurrencies in e-commerce. In the future, WiMi will continue to dedicate itself to continuous technological innovation to meet the needs of users and merchants for more efficient and flexible digital payments, and MultiChainPay Hub will continue to lead digital payments, contributing to the construction of more convenient and secure payments.

The combined company will operate under the Provident name, aiming for enhanced scale and growth opportunities. The merger is expected to create a top-tier super-community bank, offering improved services to customers and communities. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The merger between Provident Financial Services and Lakeland Bancorp represents a significant consolidation within the banking sector, which is likely to have material effects on the market dynamics and competitive landscape. The enhanced scale of the combined entity is expected to drive operational efficiencies and could lead to improved profitability margins. This is particularly relevant as the banking industry is often driven by economies of scale, where larger institutions can leverage their size to reduce costs and enhance service offerings. Investors should note the regulatory conditions imposed, such as the $200 million capital raise and the stipulated capital ratios. The former will likely dilute existing shareholders but could also be a sign of the regulators' confidence in the merger's potential stability. The required capital ratios are indicators of the merged entity's financial health post-merger. An 8.5% Tier 1 capital ratio and an 11.25% total capital ratio are robust figures, suggesting a strong capital buffer that could reassure investors about the merged entity's resilience to potential economic downturns. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the merger between Provident and Lakeland indicates a trend towards consolidation in the regional banking sector, which may be a strategic response to the competitive pressures from larger national banks and fintech companies. The combined company's anticipated focus on enhanced customer service and expanded product offerings could be a strategic move to retain and grow their customer base in a highly competitive market. By pooling resources and talent, the new entity may be better positioned to invest in technology and innovate, which is increasingly important as digital banking services become more prevalent. The announcement also suggests a commitment to community and demographic inclusivity in mortgage services, which may improve the bank's public image and customer loyalty, potentially translating into a more stable customer deposit base. This focus on community engagement and service could differentiate the combined entity in an industry where customer trust and relationships are integral to business success. Legal Expert The receipt of regulatory approvals from the FDIC and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance is a significant milestone, indicating that the merger has passed stringent regulatory scrutiny up to this point. The conditions attached to the approvals, such as the capital raise and the maintenance of certain capital ratios, reflect a regulatory environment that is focused on ensuring the stability and soundness of financial institutions. The commitment to develop an action plan to improve home mortgage applications and originations to all demographic populations is also a sign of the current regulatory emphasis on fair lending practices and community reinvestment. The merger's completion is contingent upon the Federal Reserve's approval, which is the final hurdle. This process underscores the importance of regulatory compliance in the banking industry, where mergers and acquisitions are closely monitored to prevent excessive concentration of market power and to ensure safe banking practices. The extended merger agreement to June 30, 2024, provides a clear timeline for investors to monitor progress and anticipate the final stages of the merger process. 03/25/2024 - 01:06 PM ISELIN, N.J. and OAK RIDGE, N.J., March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Provident Financial Services, Inc. (NYSE:PFS) (“Provident”), the parent company of Provident Bank, and Lakeland Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq: LBAI) (“Lakeland”), the parent company of Lakeland Bank, today announced receipt of regulatory approvals from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance for Provident and Lakeland to complete their previously announced merger. With these approvals, the only pending regulatory approval required to complete the merger is the approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Upon completion of the merger, the combined company will operate under the Provident name and will benefit from enhanced scale, and opportunities for growth and profitability. Provident’s and Lakeland’s complementary strengths will provide exceptional service to customers and communities served. “We are very pleased to be closer to combining our two great banks to create a top-tier super-community bank. This merger will afford us greater opportunity to serve the financial needs of our customers and communities, and to continue to expand and grow our product offerings,” said Anthony Labozzetta, President and CEO of Provident Bank. “The combination of our two organizations gives me great pride as we bring together top talent and leadership under one team,” said Thomas J. Shara, Lakeland’s President and CEO. The regulatory approvals contain certain conditions and commitments, including that Provident complete a $200 million capital raise prior to completion of the merger. Provident intends to satisfy this condition by raising $200 million of Tier 2 qualifying subordinated debt prior to completing the merger. Further, for a period of three years following completion of the merger, Provident Bank will be required to maintain a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio of at least 8.5% and a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of at least 11.25%. In addition, Provident Bank will maintain its ratio of commercial real estate loans to total capital and reserves at or below the levels set forth in the three-year projections supporting its regulatory applications. Provident Bank will also be obligated to develop an action plan, subject to FDIC approval, to improve home mortgage applications from and originations to all demographic populations within the combined bank’s reasonably expected market area. In connection with these approvals, Provident and Lakeland expect to agree that the combined board of directors will consist of nine directors from Provident and five directors from Lakeland. The two companies also expect to extend their merger agreement to June 30, 2024, to provide time to receive the remaining regulatory approval and to complete the subordinated debt issuance. The merger is expected to be completed in the second calendar quarter, subject to the receipt of approval for the merger from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, completion of the debt issuance and satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

But if you ask an Aflac employee what they do for a living, there is one answer we all share: Together, we help create a world where people are better prepared for the unexpected and expected to help with expenses health insurance doesn't cover.It's the word ""together"" that provides the most opportunity for us to achieve that vision. And like every company, a vision comes with goals. I don't know a leader at a company who doesn't list ""growth"" as a goal. But in our industry, growth comes with the opportunity to help people lead a more financially secure and healthier life. Earning the trust of new and keeping the trust of existing policyholders allows us to help more people. And that is what makes Aflac truly special.Aflac was created based on our founders' firsthand experience of seeing what a cancer diagnosis can do to a family. In an effort to show care to others who may be experiencing this difficult journey, we became pioneers in this space; our cancer plan was introduced in 1957 and was among the first plans we offered. Now, almost 70 years later, we continue to make a difference in the lives of families going through a cancer.From the first moment a cancer policy is obtained, throughout the treatment journey and into survivorship, we aim to help provide a caring and supportive customer experience in addition to added financial support. For instance, when someone receives an initial cancer diagnosis and calls to file a claim, they are serviced by a team of experts who are trained in this delicate and important area.Together, we follow through on the promise we made when a customer applies for a policy. And we continue to look for ways to innovate and evolve our insurance policies to provide the most valuable benefits to our insureds.Of course, we provide that same level of care across all of our product offerings - including accident, cancer, critical illness, dental, vision, life and absence disability solutions and more - and we bring it to our employees and to the communities where we live and work. Our philosophy, Care on Purpose, is reflected in everything we do.Here is something that is very important to understand: We want to pay claims. We often remind ourselves that we don't sell a tangible product; we sell a promise, and fulfilling that promise is very important to us.Whether it's through our people, our products or a process, our commitment to helping people drives everything we do. We're not just one of the largest supplemental insurance provider in the U.S. - we are a company that cares.Coverage is underwritten by Aflac.

The company's options markets provide robust liquidity for market participants to manage industrial metals price risk effectively.","Copper Option Open Interest Surpasses 200,000 for the First Time Ever Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary CME Group achieves a significant milestone as open interest in Copper options surpasses 200,000 contracts for the first time ever, reflecting strong global demand. The company's options markets provide robust liquidity for market participants to manage industrial metals price risk effectively. Positive None. Negative None. Commodities Market Analyst The surge in open interest for Copper options at the CME Group is indicative of heightened market activity and interest in this industrial metal. Copper is often viewed as a gauge for global economic health due to its widespread use in various industries. The increase in open interest, particularly in a volatile market, suggests that investors are seeking to hedge against price fluctuations or speculate on future price movements.Historically, an uptick in the trading volume and open interest of a commodity's derivatives can be a precursor to significant price movements. For stakeholders, this could mean increased volatility in the price of copper, which could impact businesses that rely on copper as a raw material. Manufacturers in electronics, construction and energy sectors, for example, might experience cost-related pressures should copper prices rise as a result of this increased market activity. Risk Management Expert From a risk management perspective, the record levels of open interest in Copper options highlight the importance of these financial instruments as tools for managing price risk. Companies involved in the production or intensive use of copper can use these options to lock in prices and budget more accurately for future costs. The availability of robust on-screen liquidity, as mentioned by the Global Head of Metals at CME Group, ensures that market participants can execute their hedging strategies effectively, even during periods of uncertainty.This development could lead to a more stable business environment for those with significant exposure to copper prices. However, it's important for these companies to understand the intricacies of the derivatives market and work with skilled financial professionals to navigate it successfully. Financial Analyst For investors and analysts monitoring the stock market, the significant interest in Copper options at CME Group can serve as a barometer for investor sentiment regarding the global economy. A high level of open interest may signal expectations of increased economic activity or concerns over potential supply disruptions. Investors might interpret this as a sign to closely watch the stocks of companies in the copper industry, including miners, smelters and equipment manufacturers, for potential impacts on their performance.Furthermore, the doubling of the previous single daily volume record indicates a remarkable level of engagement from traders, which could lead to greater liquidity and potentially more efficient markets. However, investors should be wary of the risks associated with such rapid increases in trading activity, as they can also result in greater price swings and market instability. 03/25/2024 - 10:59 AM CHICAGO, March 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, today announced that open interest in Copper options surpassed 200,000 contracts for the first time ever after achieving several consecutive daily open interest records.

Historical Mineral Resource Estimates All mineral resources estimates presented in this news release are considered to be “historical estimates” as defined under NI 43-101, and have been derived from the following (See notes below). In each instance, the historical estimate is reported using the categories of mineral resources and mineral reserves as defined by the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Reserves, and mineral reserves at that time, and these “historical estimates” are not considered by ATHA to be current. In each instance, the reliability of the historical estimate is considered reasonable, but a Qualified Person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as a current mineral resource, and ATHA is not treating the historical estimate as a current mineral resource. The historical information provides an indication of the exploration potential of the properties but may not be representative of expected results. Notes on the Historical Mineral Resource Estimate for the Angilak Deposit: This estimate is considered to be a “historical estimate” under NI 43-101 and is not considered by any of to be current. See below for further details regarding the historical mineral resource estimate for the Angilak Property. Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.The estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by geology, environment, permitting, legal, title, taxation, sociopolitical, marketing or other relevant issues.The quality and grade of the reported inferred resource in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define these inferred resources as an indicated or measured mineral resource, and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or measured resource category.Contained value metals may not add due to rounding.A 0.2% U3O8 cut-off was used.The mineral resource estimate contained in this press release is considered to be “historical estimates” as defined under NI 43-101 and is not considered to be current.The “historical estimate” is derived from a Technical Report entitled “Technical Report and Resource Update For The Angilak Property, Kivalliq Region, Nunavut, Canada”, prepared by Michael Dufresne, M.Sc., P.Geol. of APEX Geosciences, Robert Sim, B.Sc., P.Geo. of SIM Geological Inc. and Bruce Davis, Ph.D., FAusIMM of BD Resource Consulting Inc., dated March 1, 2013 for ValOre Metals Corp.As disclosed in the above noted technical report, the historical estimate was prepared under the direction of Robert Sim, P.Geo, with the assistance of Dr. Bruce Davis, FAusIMM, and consists of three-dimensional block models based on geostatistical applications using commercial mine planning software. The project limits area based in the UTM coordinate system (NAD83 Zone14) using nominal block sizes measuring 5x5x5m at Lac Cinquante and 5x3x3 m (LxWxH) at J4. Grade (assay) and geological information is derived from work conducted by Kivalliq during the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 field seasons. A thorough review of all the 2013 resource information and drill data by a Qualified Person, along with the incorporation of subsequent exploration work and results, which includes some drilling around the edges of the historical resource subsequent to the publication of the 2013 technical report, would be required in order to verify the Angilak Property historical estimate as a current mineral resource.The historical mineral resource estimate was calculated in accordance with NI 43-101 and CIM standards at the time of publication and predates the current CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (May, 2014) and CIM Estimation of Mineral Resources & Mineral Reserves Best Practices Guidelines (November, 2019).A thorough review of all historical data performed by a Qualified Person, along with additional exploration work to confirm results would be required to produce a current mineral resource estimate prepared in accordance with NI 43-101. Notes on the Historical Mineral Resource Estimate for the Moran Lake Deposit: Jeffrey A. Morgan, P.Geo. and Gary H. Giroux, P.Eng. completed a NI 43-101 technical report titled “Form 43-101F1 Technical Report on the Central Mineral Belt (CMB) Uranium Project, Labrador, Canada, Prepared for Crosshair Exploration & Mining Corp.” and dated July 31, 2008, with an updated mineral resource estimate for the Moran Lake C-Zone along with initial mineral resources for the Armstrong and Area 1 deposits. They modelled three packages in the Moran Lake Upper C-Zone (the Upper C Main, Upper C Mylonite, and Upper C West), Moran Lake Lower C-Zone, two packages in Armstrong (Armstrong Z1 and Armstrong Z3), and Trout Pond. These mineral resources are based on 3D block models with ordinary kriging used to interpolate grades into 10 m x 10 m x 4 m blocks. A cut-off grade of 0.015% U3O8 was used for all zones other than the Lower C Zone which employed a cut-off grade of 0.035%. A thorough review of all historical data performed by a Qualified Person, along with additional exploration work to confirm results, would be required to produce a current mineral resource estimate prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 standards. Notes on the Historical Mineral Resource Estimate for the Anna Lake Deposit: The mineral resource estimate contained in this table is considered to be a “historical estimate” as defined under NI 43-101, and is not considered to be current and is not being treated as such. A Qualified Person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources. A qualified person would need to review and verify the scientific information and conduct an analysis and reconciliation of historical drill and geological data in order to verify the historical estimate as a current mineral resource.Reported by Bayswater Uranium Corporation in a Technical Report entitled “Form 43-101 Technical Report on the Anna Lake Uranium Project, Central Mineral Belt, Labrador, Canada”, prepared by R. Dean Fraser, P.Geo. and Gary H. Giroux, P.Eng., dated September 30, 2009.A 3-dimensional geologic model of the deposit was created for the purpose of the resource estimate using the Gemcom/Surpac modeling software. A solid model was created using a minimum grade x thickness cutoff of 3 meters grading 0.03% U3O8. Intersections not meeting this cutoff were generally not incorporated into the model. The shell of this modeled zone was then used to constrain the mineralization for the purpose of the block model. Assay composites 2.5 meters in length that honoured the mineralized domains were used to interpolate grades into blocks using ordinary kriging. An average specific gravity of 2.93 was used to convert volumes to tonnes. The specific gravity data was acquired in-house and consisted of an average of seventeen samples collected from the mineralised section of the core. The resource was classified into Measured, Indicated or Inferred using semi-variogram ranges applied to search ellipses. All resources estimated at Anna Lake fall under the “Inferred” category due to the wide spaced drill density. An exploration program would need to be conducted, including twinning of historical drill holes in order to verify the Anna Lake Project estimate as a current mineral resource.

The company discloses its carbon emissions data, highlighting its commitment to using 100% renewable energy. Gryphon's leadership in ESG is evident through its collaboration with CarbonChain for annual assessments and receiving the Sustainable Bitcoin certification by Energy Web. This milestone sets a new standard for the industry, emphasizing the importance of transparency and responsible corporate decisions. Positive None. Negative None. Sustainability Analyst With Gryphon Digital Mining's release of their carbon emissions data, we're witnessing a significant shift in the cryptocurrency mining sector towards greater sustainability and accountability. The move to disclose such detailed ESG data is not standard practice in the industry, which has been criticized for its environmental impact, particularly in terms of energy consumption.By utilizing 100% renewable energy, Gryphon is setting a benchmark that could potentially stimulate a ripple effect, encouraging other companies to follow suit. This could lead to a reevaluation of the sector's reputation and possibly attract environmentally conscious investors. However, the long-term impact on Gryphon's operational costs and profitability remains to be seen, as renewable energy solutions can sometimes be more expensive than non-renewable sources.Moreover, the Sustainable Bitcoin Certification by Energy Web adds a layer of credibility to Gryphon's claims, which could enhance its brand value and investor trust. The transparency Gryphon is championing may become a competitive advantage if market demand shifts towards more sustainable investment opportunities. Financial Analyst The strategic decision by Gryphon to publish its ESG data could have financial implications for the company and its investors. By aligning with the growing trend of sustainable investing, Gryphon may be able to tap into a larger pool of investment capital that is increasingly being directed towards companies with strong ESG practices.Investors are likely to scrutinize the report to understand the potential cost implications of Gryphon's commitment to renewable energy. If the shift to 100% renewable energy operations leads to cost savings in the long run, this could positively impact Gryphon's bottom line and make the company a more attractive investment. On the other hand, if the costs are higher, it could put pressure on profitability, at least in the short term.Additionally, Gryphon's Nasdaq listing and the transparency it brings could lead to increased stock market volatility as investors react to the new information. The company's pioneering approach might also set a precedent for regulatory expectations in the future, potentially affecting the entire industry's reporting standards and stock market performance. Environmental Policy Expert Gryphon's publication of its carbon emissions data represents an important intersection between corporate responsibility and environmental policy. This proactive approach to ESG reporting could influence policy makers by providing a model for transparency that might be emulated in regulatory frameworks.The company's use of third-party measurement by CarbonChain enhances the credibility of its data, which is important for policy discussions around the environmental impact of bitcoin mining. This level of detail can inform more nuanced policy that supports the growth of sustainable practices within the industry.From a policy perspective, Gryphon's actions could be seen as a response to the increasing demand for corporate environmental responsibility. It may also prompt other companies in the crypto industry to adopt similar practices, which would be beneficial for the overall goal of reducing the industry's carbon footprint. 03/25/2024 - 09:45 AM Gryphon Becomes First Miner to Publish its ESG data, leading the industry in transparency and environmental responsibilityLAS VEGAS, NV / ACCESSWIRE / March 25, 2024 / Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc. (Nasdaq:GRYP) (""Gryphon"" or the ""Company"") is taking a bold step in ESG leadership by publishing its carbon emissions data publicly. Today's release of the full report (available here), which includes two annual carbon emissions assessments undertaken by CarbonChain, is the first time a bitcoin mining company has provided a granular accounting of its company's carbon footprint. Gryphon uses CarbonChain for third-party measurement annually, and recently proved that it is using 100% renewable energy. Gryphon believes that transparency is what will drive the industry forward for achievement of climate goals and responsible corporate decision making.As previously reported, in fiscal year 2023, Gryphon used over 98% renewable energy, and started 2024 with 100% renewable operations ahead of its merger and listing on Nasdaq. This news followed Gryphon's receipt in 2023 of the Sustainable Bitcoin certification by Energy Web, an independent non-profit that develops open-source software for clean energy solutions. This certification known as Green Proofs for Bitcoin (""GP4BTC""), is a first-of-its kind initiative to establish an independent, standardized energy measurement system for the Bitcoin mining industry and represents over two years of collaborative work between Gryphon, Energy Web, and some of the world's largest asset managers and clean energy research organizations.Releasing the data upon which the Sustainable Bitcoin Certification was awarded to Gryphon is intended to open the door for further transparency and climate accounting initiatives in the bitcoin mining and wider crypto industry. This report provides interesting details about ways that companies can become less impactful on the environment such as choosing greener air freight or shipping options. Gryphon's management believes that the press and legislators too often comment on energy usage alone, without recognizing that other sources of carbon emissions should be counted and become a part of an overall carbon footprint strategy.""Championing transparency is a core value of bitcoin and blockchain technology, and something that should be standard for digital asset companies as bitcoin achieves global adoption. Showing by doing has always been the best way to counter false claims about bitcoin mining's negative impact. If we want support from legislators and the press, the industry needs to step up and use decentralized technologies to transparently prove and verify data on chain - the way it was intended,"" said Brittany Kaiser, Chair of the Board of Gryphon Digital Mining.""Gryphon's ambition to exclusively use renewable energy is now publicly accounted for, and we hope their approach is adopted more widely as all eyes are on bitcoin companies as the industry booms,"" said Adam Hearne, CEO of CarbonChain.To learn more about Gryphon, please visit https://gryphondigitalmining.com/.About Gryphon Digital Mining Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc. is an innovative venture in the bitcoin space dedicated to helping bring digital assets onto the clean energy grid.

The drug inhibits platelet activation by targeting SGLT1 and SGLT2, potentially reducing the risk of stroke and MI in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD. The study on heart failure medication prescriptions highlighted opportunities to improve guideline-directed medical therapy for patients with HF, emphasizing the need to address care gaps by sex and age. Negative None. Cardiologist The recent findings on sotagliflozin, particularly its efficacy in reducing stroke events in high-risk patients, add a significant chapter to cardiovascular pharmacotherapy. The reported 34% risk reduction in all-cause stroke and 32% in ischemic stroke is noteworthy, as stroke prevention is a pivotal aspect of managing type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. These conditions often coexist and synergistically elevate cardiovascular risk, making effective interventions essential.From a cardiological standpoint, the dual inhibition mechanism of sotagliflozin, targeting both SGLT2 and SGLT1, represents an innovative approach. SGLT2 inhibitors have already been recognized for their cardiovascular benefits and the additional SGLT1 inhibition could offer a broader therapeutic impact. The modulation of glucose transport and inflammatory proteins in endothelial cells, as well as the inhibition of platelet activation, suggest potential for sotagliflozin to address atherothrombosis beyond glycemic control.For patients, these findings may translate to improved clinical outcomes and quality of life. However, it's essential to consider the long-term safety profile of sotagliflozin, given the complex nature of its patient population. Ongoing surveillance and post-marketing studies will be important to monitor adverse effects and ensure the drug's net clinical benefit. Healthcare Economist From an economic perspective, the approval and subsequent utilization of sotagliflozin for heart failure and cardiovascular risk reduction could have substantial implications for healthcare costs and resource allocation. Stroke is a leading cause of disability and incurs significant healthcare expenses, not only due to the acute management but also from long-term rehabilitation and care needs.The potential cost savings from reduced stroke incidence and severity, as well as the decrease in hospitalizations for heart failure, could be significant. However, these benefits must be weighed against the cost of sotagliflozin, especially as healthcare systems grapple with budget constraints and the imperative to maximize the cost-effectiveness of interventions.Moreover, disparities in the initiation of guideline-directed medical therapies, as highlighted by the gender and age differences in prescription patterns, suggest that there may be systemic inefficiencies and biases in treatment approaches. Addressing these care gaps could lead to more equitable and effective management of heart failure, further enhancing the economic value of interventions like sotagliflozin. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The FDA's approval of sotagliflozin and its demonstrated efficacy in reducing cardiovascular events place Lexicon Pharmaceuticals in a favorable position within the cardiovascular drug market. As a first-in-class dual SGLT1/2 inhibitor, sotagliflozin could capture a significant market share, especially among patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease who are at high cardiovascular risk.The pharmaceutical market for diabetes and heart failure is highly competitive and differentiation is key to success. Sotagliflozin's dual mechanism offers a unique selling point. However, market penetration will depend on factors such as pricing, insurance coverage and the ability of Lexicon to communicate the drug's benefits to clinicians and patients effectively.It's also important to monitor the competitive landscape for potential new entrants or advancements in alternative therapies that could impact sotagliflozin's market position. Strategic partnerships, continued investment in research and attention to post-marketing safety data will be essential for sustaining growth and addressing the needs of a diverse patient population. 03/25/2024 - 09:20 AM THE WOODLANDS, Texas, March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: LXRX) today announced that four data presentations related to sotagliflozin, an inhibitor of two sodium glucose transport proteins (SGLT2 and SGLT1), will be delivered during the American College of Cardiology 73rd Annual Scientific Session & Expo being held April 6 - 8, 2024 in Atlanta, Georgia, including results from a post-hoc evaluation of the efficacy of sotagliflozin in reducing stroke events in patients with type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and high cardiovascular (CV) risk in the SCORED Phase 3 clinical trial. “Following FDA’s 2023 approval of INPEFA® (sotagliflozin) for heart failure (HF), researchers are adding to the overall scientific understanding of sotagliflozin, including clinical evidence of its ability to reduce the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction (MI), or heart attack,” said Craig Granowitz, M.D., Ph.D., Lexicon’s senior vice president and chief medical officer. Details of the presentations are as follows: Sotagliflozin Reduces Stroke Outcomes in Patients with Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease – a moderated poster presentation, Monday, April 8, 12:15 - 12:25 p.m. ET, Theater 8‚ presented by Rahul Aggarwal, M.D., Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New YorkStudy researchers evaluated the efficacy of sotagliflozin in reducing all-cause and cause-specific stroke outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes, CKD, and high CV risk. In a post-hoc analysis of data from the 10,584 patients in the SCORED Phase 3 clinical trial, 213 all-cause stroke events occurred, including 29 (13.6%) fatal events. Sotagliflozin reduced the risk of all-cause stroke by 34%, with 1.2 events per 100 patient-years in the sotagliflozin group and 1.8 events per 100 patient-years in the placebo group. Similarly, sotagliflozin reduced the risk of ischemic stroke by 32%, with 0.8 events per 100 patient-years in the sotagliflozin group and 1.2 events per 100 patient-years in the placebo group.Click here to access additional study details in the online abstract.

Lexicon has advanced multiple medicines to market and has a pipeline of promising drug candidates in heart failure, neuropathic pain, diabetes and metabolism and other indications. For additional information, please visit www.lexpharma.com. About INPEFA® (sotagliflozin) Discovered using Lexicon’s unique approach to gene science, INPEFA® (sotagliflozin) is an oral inhibitor of two proteins responsible for glucose regulation known as sodium-glucose cotransporter types 2 and 1 (SGLT2 and SGLT1). SGLT2 is responsible for glucose reabsorption by the kidney and SGLT1 is responsible for glucose absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. INPEFA has been studied in multiple patient populations encompassing heart failure, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease in clinical studies involving approximately 20,000 patients. INDICATION INPEFA is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and urgent heart failure visit in adults with: heart failure ortype 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and other cardiovascular risk factors IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION Dosing: Assess renal function and volume status and, if necessary, correct volume depletion prior to initiation of INPEFA. INPEFA dosing for patients with decompensated heart failure may begin when patients are hemodynamically stable, including when hospitalized or immediately upon discharge. Contraindications: INPEFA is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any component. Warnings and Precautions: Ketoacidosis: INPEFA increases the risk of ketoacidosis in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and pancreatic disorders are also risk factors. The risk of ketoacidosis may be greater with higher doses. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes using sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Before initiating INPEFA, assess risk factors for ketoacidosis. Consider ketone monitoring in patients with T1DM and consider ketone monitoring in others at risk for ketoacidosis, and educate patients on the signs/symptoms of ketoacidosis. Patients receiving INPEFA may require monitoring and temporary discontinuation of therapy in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis. Assess patients who present with signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis or ketoacidosis, regardless of blood glucose level. If suspected, discontinue INPEFA, evaluate, and treat promptly. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting INPEFA. Volume Depletion: INPEFA can cause intravascular volume depletion which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating INPEFA in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function, and monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension during therapy. Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis: Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors, including INPEFA, increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization have been reported. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly. Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues: Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. INPEFA may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used with INPEFA. Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier’s Gangrene): Reports of Fournier’s Gangrene, a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in post-marketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Assess patients who present with pain, tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue INPEFA, closely monitor patient signs and symptoms, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for heart failure. Genital Mycotic Infections: INPEFA increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. Monitor and treat as appropriate. Urinary Glucose Test and 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) Assay: these are not reliable for patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use alternative testing methods to monitor glucose levels. Common Adverse Reactions: the most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 5%) were urinary tract infection, volume depletion, diarrhea, and hypoglycemia. Drug Interactions: Digoxin: Monitor patients appropriately as there is an increase in the exposure of digoxin when coadministered with INPEFA 400 mg.Uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) Inducer: The coadministration of rifampicin, an inducer of UGTs, with sotagliflozin resulted in a decrease in the exposure of sotagliflozin.Lithium: Concomitant use of an SGLT2 inhibitor with lithium may decrease serum lithium concentrations. Monitor serum lithium concentration more frequently during INPEFA initiation and with dosage changes. Use in Specific Populations: Pregnancy and Lactation: INPEFA is not recommended during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, nor while breastfeeding.Geriatric Use: No INPEFA dosage change is recommended based on age. No overall differences in efficacy were detected between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Elderly patients may be at increased risk for volume depletion adverse reactions, including hypotension.Renal Impairment: INPEFA was evaluated in patients with chronic kidney disease (eGFR 25 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and in patients with heart failure with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. The safety profile of INPEFA across eGFR subgroups in these studies was consistent with the known safety profile. There was an increase in volume-related adverse events (e.g., hypotension, dizziness) in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2 relative to the overall safety population. Efficacy and safety studies with INPEFA did not enroll patients with an eGFR less than 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 or on dialysis. After starting therapy in the studies, patients were discontinued if eGFR fell below 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or were initiated on chronic dialysis.Hepatic Impairment: INPEFA is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.

The property, located at 181 Lombardy Street, offers convenient access and parking. TRNO focuses on industrial real estate in major U.S. markets with a 5.7% estimated stabilized cap rate. Positive None. Negative None. Real Estate Analyst The acquisition of an industrial property by Terreno Realty Corporation in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, represents a strategic expansion within a highly sought-after market. The location adjacent to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway offers logistical advantages for distribution companies, potentially increasing the property's value. The investment in industrial real estate aligns with the broader trend of e-commerce growth, requiring more distribution centers close to urban areas to facilitate quick delivery. A stabilized cap rate of 5.7% is moderately attractive, considering the current economic climate and the average cap rates in the region for industrial properties. However, the property's vacancy indicates that immediate income generation is not guaranteed. Terreno will need to invest in capital expenditures and leasing efforts to reach stabilization. The short-term costs may affect cash flow, but if managed effectively, the property could provide a steady income stream and asset appreciation in the long term, given the robust demand for industrial spaces in major cities. Market Research Analyst Industrial real estate remains a strong sector, especially in coastal markets with limited supply and high demand. Terreno Realty's focus on these areas could provide a competitive advantage. The acquisition in Brooklyn, a borough experiencing significant gentrification and industrial-to-residential conversions, suggests that Terreno is capitalizing on the scarcity of industrial zoned land. This scarcity may drive up rental rates and property values over time, benefiting Terreno's portfolio. Investors should monitor the company's ability to lease the vacant property, as it will be a critical factor in achieving the estimated stabilized cap rate. The company's track record in leasing and operating similar assets will be an important indicator of future performance. Additionally, the proximity to the expressway could make the property particularly attractive to logistics companies, a sector that has seen growth due to the rise in online shopping. Financial Analyst The $12.0 million acquisition by Terreno Realty is a significant capital allocation that reflects confidence in the industrial real estate market's resilience and potential for growth. The property's vacant status poses a risk, as immediate returns are not realized and there is a dependency on future leasing success. Investors should consider the company's expertise in rapidly leasing similar properties and the current market demand for such spaces. From a financial perspective, the estimated stabilized cap rate serves as an indicator of potential return on investment, but it is contingent upon achieving a 95% occupancy rate. The initial non-income generating status of the property could be a drag on earnings in the near term. However, given the strategic location and the ongoing trend of industrial space shortages in urban areas, the long-term outlook could be favorable if the company successfully leases the property at or above market rates. 03/25/2024 - 09:15 AM BELLEVUE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Terreno Realty Corporation (NYSE:TRNO), an acquirer, owner and operator of industrial real estate in six major coastal U.S. markets, acquired an industrial property located in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York on March 22, 2024 for a purchase price of approximately $12.0 million.

The property is at 181 Lombardy Street adjacent to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, provides one dock-high and one grade-level loading position and parking for 10 cars. The property is vacant and the estimated stabilized cap rate is 5.7%. Estimated stabilized cap rates are calculated as annualized cash basis net operating income stabilized to market occupancy (generally 95%) divided by total acquisition cost. Total acquisition cost includes the initial purchase price, the effects of marking assumed debt to market, buyer’s due diligence and closing costs, estimated near-term capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to achieve stabilization.

The assets are regulated under UK green attribute regulations and have no project debt. The acquisition closed at $66 million, representing an EV/EBITDA multiple of 6.6 times. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The acquisition of wind assets by Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure plc represents a strategic expansion into the U.K. renewable energy market. The investment aligns with global trends favoring sustainable and renewable energy sources, which are increasingly important as governments and corporations work towards carbon neutrality. With a combined installed capacity of 32 MW, these assets bolster Atlantica's portfolio, potentially increasing its market share in the renewable sector.From a financial standpoint, the Enterprise Value to EBITDA multiple of 6.6 is within a reasonable range for the industry, suggesting a fair valuation of the acquired assets. However, it's essential to monitor how these assets integrate with Atlantica's existing operations and whether the anticipated synergies, such as the use of net operating loss carryforwards, materialize in improved financial performance. Renewable Energy Consultant The U.K.'s green attribute regulation and the provision of renewables obligation certificates until 2033 provide a favorable regulatory environment for Atlantica's newly acquired wind assets. These certificates are a critical component in the U.K.'s support mechanism for renewable electricity generation, offering a degree of revenue certainty for Atlantica.Moreover, the absence of project debt on these assets is a positive indicator of operational efficiency and financial health. It suggests that Atlantica may be able to leverage these assets without the immediate burden of servicing debt, which could enhance the return on investment. The operational track record of the assets will be a key factor in determining their reliability and performance consistency in the U.K.'s variable climate. Tax Analyst Atlantica's use of existing net operating loss carryforwards as part of this acquisition is a strategic tax planning move. These carryforwards can offset taxable income from the wind assets, potentially reducing Atlantica's tax liability in the U.K. This approach could improve cash flows and overall returns from the investment, making it a savvy financial decision, assuming the carryforwards are utilized effectively.Investors should note, however, that the value of these tax assets is contingent on future profitability. It's important to assess whether Atlantica's projections for the use of these carryforwards are realistic and how they align with the company's broader financial strategy. 03/25/2024 - 09:11 AM Atlantica Announces the Acquisition of Two Wind Assets in the United Kingdom March 25, 2024 – Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure plc (NASDAQ: AY) (“Atlantica” or the “Company”), announced today that it completed the acquisition of a 100% equity interest stake in two wind assets, with a combined installed capacity of 32 MW in Scotland, United Kingdom.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, all statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this press release, including, without limitation, those regarding our future financial position and results of operations, our strategy, plans, objectives, goals and targets, future developments in the markets in which we operate or are seeking to operate. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “believe”, “could”, “estimate”, “expect“, “may”, “potential”, “should” or “will” or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions or terminology. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release and are not guarantees of future performance and are based on numerous assumptions. In particular, Atlantica does not guarantee any future performance of the newly-acquired assets nor that it will be able to realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisition. Our actual results of operations, financial condition and the development of events may differ materially from (and be more negative than) those made in, or suggested by, the forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA and Enterprise Value to EBITDA. Non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under IFRS as issued by IASB and should not be considered alternatives to operating profit or profit for the period or net cash provided by operating activities or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities. Please refer to the appendix of this press release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS as well as the reasons why management believes the use of non-GAAP financial measures (including EBITDA and Enterprise Value to EBITDA) in this press release provides useful information to investors. Appendix 1: Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Our management believes EBITDA and Enterprise Value to EBITDA are useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance or the operating performance of the assets recently acquired because such measures provide investors with additional tools to compare business performance across companies and across periods. EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. EBITDA and Enterprise Value to EBITDA are widely used by other companies in the same industry. Our management believes Enterprise Value to EBITDA is a useful valuation tool widely used by investors when evaluating transactions as it compares the investment’s value to its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. In this press release we present certain non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that they and other similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures employed by other companies and they may have limitations as analytical tools. These measures may not be fit for isolated consideration or as a substitute for analysis of our or our acquired assets’ operating results as reported under IFRS as issued by the IASB. Non-GAAP financial measures and ratios are not measurements of performance or liquidity under IFRS as issued by the IASB. Thus, they should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit, profit for the period, any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities. Some of the limitations of these non-GAAP measures are: they do not reflect cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs;they may not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments, on debt;although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA and Enterprise Value to EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements; andthe fact that other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA, and Enterprise Value to EBITDA differently than we do, which limits their usefulness as comparative measures. We define EBITDA as profit/(loss) for the period attributable to the acquired assets, after previously adding back loss/(profit) attributable to non-controlling interest, income tax expense, financial expense (net), depreciation, amortization and impairment charges. We define Enterprise Value as Atlantica’s total investment. We define Enterprise Value to EBITDA as an investment’s Enterprise Value divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.
