Yahoo Finance,Paramount stock drops after buyout rumors: 'The worst time in the world to sell',https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paramount-stock-drops-after-buyout-rumors-the-worst-time-in-the-world-to-sell-191703124.html,Paramount has reportedly entered into exclusive merger talks with David Ellison's Skydance Media. IAC chairman and Fox founder Barry Diller says the timing couldn't be worse.,"Paramount's (PARA) stock dropped nearly 10% on Thursday after a 15% surge the day prior following reports the company has entered into exclusive merger talks with David Ellison's Skydance Media.The timing of the discussions couldn't be worse, according to one media mogul.""First of all it's the worst time in the world to sell this thing,"" IAC chairman and Fox founder Barry Diller said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday. ""It is the perfect candidate for actually turning itself around but the idea that you ought to sell it? Whoever gets in that and whatever base they get in it for, there's an enormous amount of work that has to take place.""According to reports from The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg, Paramount entered into exclusive talks with Skydance after declining a $26 billion all-cash offer, which included $14 billion worth of debt, for the entire company from private equity firm Apollo. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)Paramount has been bleeding money in its streaming business. Although losses have narrowed, the company still reported a direct-to-consumer (DTC) loss of $490 million in the fourth quarter. It's also been plagued by plummeting linear TV revenue as more consumers cut the cord.To combat the declines, Paramount has committed to various cost-efficiency plans, including layoffs, business restructurings, price hikes, and even a surprise dividend cut. But a potential sale has been on the table for months.Skydance is aiming for a two-step deal targeting Paramount's holding company, National Amusements (NAI). Shari Redstone currently serves as the president of NAI. She's also the controlling shareholder of Paramount Global.National Amusements owns approximately 10% of Paramount's equity capital value and maintains 77% of voting shares — valued at around $1 billion.FILE PHOTO: According to multiple reports, Paramount has entered into exclusive merger talks with David Ellison's Skydance Media. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo (Reuters / Reuters)According to the Journal, Redstone and Ellison have agreed to terms that would allow Skydance to purchase Redstone's controlling stake. Skydance would then merge its production studio with Paramount's — an important contingency to the deal, which must first be approved by an independent committee of directors at Paramount. It's unclear what Ellison plans to do with the rest of the company.Story continuesWall Street analysts remain skeptical that a Skydance deal can make it to the finish line.""The more complicated the deal, the less likely it gets done,"" Needham analyst Laura Martin told Yahoo Finance. ""The Skydance deal with the two different pieces...that feels complicated.""Doug Creutz, TD Cowen managing director, agreed, telling Yahoo Finance, ""A purchase of NAI would allow somebody to control Paramount, [it] wouldn't necessarily help current Paramount shareholders.""Paramount has long been viewed as a potential acquisition target, primarily due to its small size relative to competitors. The company boasts a current market cap of just around $8 billion, compared to Disney's (DIS) $218 billion and Netflix's (NFLX) $273 billion.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

In other words, we're kind of fine where we are.""The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 286.27 points, or 0.73%, to 38,840.87, the S&P 500 lost 22.46 points, or 0.43%, to 5,189.03 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 48.71 points, or 0.3%, to 16,228.75.Investors are looking forward to Friday's monthly U.S. jobs report for further clues on the labor market and inflation.Economists polled by Reuters expect the nonfarm payrolls for March to fall to 200,000 from 275,000 in February, while the unemployment rate will likely remain steady at 3.9%.On the plus side, Levi Strauss shares jumped after the apparel maker raised its annual profit forecast, citing savings from its recent cost-cutting measures and fewer discounts.

Beauty After Market Jitters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-defend-e-l-f-183831514.html,"The mass beauty company's stock fell Wednesday, after Ulta Beauty's CEO raised concerns over cooling demand across the entire beauty category.","Market jitters over E.l.f. Beauty have been overblown, according to analysts.The mass beauty company’s shares fell almost 12 percent Wednesday, its biggest one-day fall since October, after Ulta Beauty CEO Dave Kimbell warned that demand for beauty in general had slowed by more than he had anticipated. Other beauty companies, including the Estée Lauder Cos. and Coty Inc., also saw shares slide by 4 percent and 6 percent respectively. Ulta, meanwhile, dropped 15 percent.More from WWDUlta Beauty CEO Sees Demand Cool Across the BoardEadem Scores Fable Investments FundingEXCLUSIVE: Serena Williams Launches the Inclusive Makeup Line She Always WantedBut in a note, Anna Lizzul, a research analyst at Bank of America, described E.l.f.’s share price slide as both “overblown” and “overdone.”She pointed to the fact that while Kimbell said the slowdown was across segments and prices during a Wednesday appearance at a J.P. Morgan conference in New York City, he highlighted E.l.f. as a “real growth driver for the category and for us,” contributing to Ulta’s share gain in the affordable beauty segment, with higher-end makeup and hair as more challenging categories.“Following the weakness week-to-date, we see an attractive opportunity for E.l.f. shares,” Lizzul said. “We continue to see outsized opportunity for growth ahead with shelf space gains at Walmart and CVS, where E.l.f. is underpenetrated.”At the same time, Ashley Helgans, an analyst at Jefferies, added that while E.l.f.’s data has slowed in recent months due to tough comparisons, she is still seeing meaningful consumer engagement in the company, whose brands include E.l.f., Naturium, Well People and Keys Soulcare with Alicia Keys.In particular, she said there is much opportunity for the E.l.f. brand internationally. In the Netherlands, it just rolled out in Etos and Douglas.“The footprint of these two retailers is significant. The Netherlands mass color cosmetics market in 2022 was worth $394 million and mass skin $547 million.”Story continuesIn October, E.l.f. entered Douglas in Italy, and last month it opened its first European office in London, furthering a commitment to grow the company’s international business.“We see significant runway in both the U.K. and other markets around the world,” said Tarang Amin, chairman and CEO of E.l.f. Beauty at the time of the London office opening. “E.l.f. will bring its unique value proposition, powerhouse innovation and disruptive marketing engine — which have proven to resonate across categories and geographies — into new places and spaces with the purpose to serve every eye, lip and face.”The company is forecasting full-year sales in a range of between $980 million and $990 million, compared with its previous forecast of $896 million to $906 million.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped 0.2%.All three major averages reversed midday gains in afternoon trading as Federal Reserve Bank of Minnesota President Neel Kashkari said the Fed won't cut at all this year if inflation stalls.Prior to the comments, the market had shaking off stocks' rough start to the second quarter after Chair Jerome Powell soothed concerns the Federal Reserve would lose its nerve for making rate cuts.The labor market remains in focus for investors with the March jobs report, due out Friday morning, seen as a key economic input for the Fed's data-dependent policy decision-making.

Bob Iger's contract is set to expire at the end of 2026.""[The board is] confident they will choose the right person at the right time,"" Iger added. ""They're treating it with a sense of urgency because it is so important.""Succession became a key sticking point for Peltz and his backers throughout a months-long proxy battle that officially ended at the company's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday.At the meeting, Disney revealed the current board will remain intact following a shareholder vote that gave the company's slate a win ""by a substantial margin."" Peltz had attempted to secure board seats for himself and former Disney CFO Jay Rasulo.""This whole process gave the board and some members of management an opportunity to engage with many shareholders, perhaps on an even deeper level,"" Iger said. ""What we heard was, surprisingly, consistent with exactly what our priorities are ... Clearly, shareholders are interested and care very much about succession.""Disney's succession problems began in 2020 after Iger hand-selected Bob Chapek, who at the time was head of the company's parks, experiences, and products segment, for the job.Shortly after, the COVID-19 pandemic upended the business. Under Chapek's tenure, Disney also faced political battles, A-list talent problems, and controversial reorganizations. Meanwhile, Chapek was left to contend with the ever-looming shadow of Iger, who spoke out against some of Chapek's decisions even prior to his return. Chapek was ousted from the position in November 2022 after less than three years on the job.Read more here.

The move, in this writer's humble view, has been fueled by better execution at GM around the EV transition and a new desire to return cash to shareholders.Wall Street may be finally getting into gear on the stock after years of disbelief.""With Q1 wrapping up, it's become clearer that GM is likely to post another resilient quarter. While industry headwinds and execution risks persist, the now five plus year running pushback that GM’s latest strong quarter/year will be its last is increasingly looking stale,"" said Citi analyst Itay Michaeli in a client note this morning.Michaeli adds the ""comeback"" for GM is well underway, and he sees the stock as one of his top picks.I came away impressed after spending the day touring an EV facility in Detroit with GM chair and CEO Mary Barra (video below).The company is working on a lot of hard stuff that takes precision execution to profitably pull off. Considering that organized chaos, it's a positive that GM is still a nicely profitable automaker and is out there buying back stock with its excess cash.It may be time to get GM's stock out of the single-digit PE multiple range it has been stuck in for eons."

After spiking on fears that rate cuts weren’t coming anytime soon, bond yields slipped early Thursday after Powell’s comments.TLT, the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF jumped Thursday but at $92.50, is still trading near its lows for the year. According to data available on etf.com, fund flows for TLT have been on a rollercoaster ride since the start of the year as investors have questioned the future path of rate cuts from the Fed.TLT flows YTD:Source: etf.comBond ETFs are notoriously sensitive to interest rate moves and “higher for longer” interest rates have provided a buying opportunity for investors. Since bond prices have an inverse relationship with yields, higher rates have kept yields high and prices low.Investors will still have to wait a few more months before it becomes clear when the Fed will begin to cut rates. After Powell’s comments, probability of a June rate cut jumped to 61%, according to the CME Fed Watch Tool.Elsewhere in markets, weekly jobless claims (or people filing for unemployment for the first time) increased to 221,000 for the last week in March, the Labor Department reported today. That’s more than economists had originally forecast. The numbers are the last bit of employment data investors will receive before nonfarm payrolls are released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday.Investors have been watching the employment situation as the jobs market serves as a proxy for economic strength by the Fed. Higher levels of unemployment and a weakening labor market could provide hopes that the Fed will cut rates sooner than later to help stimulate the economy.Story continuesAnd the aftermath of the Taiwanese earthquake still continues to hit SOXS, the Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3X Shares. Taiwan remains the global capital of semiconductor manufacturing, accounting for 60% of all chips production.
