Yahoo Finance,"Stock market today: S&P 500 hits fresh record, Dow jumps over 475 points",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-today-sp-500-hits-fresh-record-dow-jumps-over-475-points-200500649.html,A stock rebound would come after an unusual three-day losing streak for the S&P 500.,"US stocks rebounded Wednesday after several days of red closings, as the S&P 500 jumped to a fresh record and the Dow surged more than 475 points.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was up 0.8% to close at a record of 5,248.50. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 1.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.5%.The stock rebound came after a three-day losing streak for the benchmark S&P 500, which has set a new record closing high more than 20 times this year. And the gains extend beyond the start of 2024. As Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre notes, the index is on track for its fifth-straight monthly gain — and that could be a signal it's poised to run further.Later this week, investors will see the latest reading of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. That index, which contains the Federal Reserve's preferred ""core"" PCE inflation measure, is set for release on Friday.Also in focus is the return of the meme stock, the mania around companies that have become phenomena on social media. Investors need not look further than Reddit (RDDT), which as a platform has been responsible for much of the frenzy over the years. Reddit stock had doubled from its IPO price, though it fell 11% on Tuesday as the stock gained short interest due to its recent surge.Meanwhile, shares of Trump Media and Technology (DJT), the social media startup founded by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, gained another 14% after Tuesday's 16% gain. But perhaps the OG meme stock, GameStop (GME), plunged 15% after reporting what one analyst called an ""unsustainable"" sales decline and announcing job cuts.Live11 updatesWed, March 27, 2024 at 1:00 PM PDT Josh SchaferA day for the laggardsThe two worst performing sectors in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to start the year led the trade on Wednesday.Utilities (XLU) and Real Estate (XLRE) both rose more than 2% Wednesday.Real Estate is still down more than 2% for the year while Utilities is up more than 2%, lagging the S&P 500's more than 9% to start the year.The small cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT) also outperformed rising more than 1.7%. For the year, the Russell has gained less than 4%. Wed, March 27, 2024 at 12:30 PM PDT Josh SchaferTrending tickers Wednesday afternoonShares of Carnival Corporation (CCL) rose more than 1% as the company reported booking volumes. Also of note, the cruise line operator warned that the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore could impact the company's full-year net income by $10 million.Merck (MRK) stock rose roughly 5% after the company received FDA approval for drug that treats a threatening, but rare, lung condition.Shares of Robinhood (HOOD) were higher by nearly 4% after the company announced the launch of its first credit card. Robinhod CEO Vlad Tenev told Yahoo Finance the credit card business has ""very high margins"" and is ""very profitable,"" when discussing the launch. Wed, March 27, 2024 at 11:45 AM PDTAlexandra CanalParamount debt rating downgraded to junk Shares of Paramount Global (PARA) reversed losses after falling on the heels of another credit downgrade.S&P Global downgraded the company's debt rating to junk, citing the rapid decline of linear television as more consumers cut the cord in favor of streaming services.The ratings agency, which reduced its rating on Paramount to ""BB+"" from ""BBB-"", said the shift to streaming will continue to pressure Paramount's cash flow.Paramount shares, which are down more than 20% since the start of the year, edged about 1% higher in afternoon trading on Wednesday.The downgrade comes as the company weighs potential buyers. Most recently, Apollo Global reportedly offered $11 billion for the company's studio, according to The Wall Street Journal. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)Paramount has long been viewed as a potential acquisition target. Production studio Skydance Media has reportedly discussed a two-step deal targeting Paramount's holding company, National Amusements.Shari Redstone, who serves as the non-executive chairwoman of Paramount Global and president of National Amusements, will ultimately determine the company's fate. National Amusements owns approximately 10% of Paramount's equity capital value and maintains 77% of voting shares — valued at around $1 billion.Redstone has been hesitant to break up the company, with Paramount's studio business viewed as its most attractive asset amid a declining linear television ecosystem.Paramount's studio serves as the engine behind top Hollywood hits including ""Top Gun: Maverick"" and ""A Quiet Place,"" in addition to successful series like ""Yellowstone.""Wed, March 27, 2024 at 11:04 AM PDT Josh SchaferA 'stealthy' rotation in sectors dominated March's trading actionMarch is just about over, and it has definitively been a month of rotation in the stock market rally.As of Tuesday's close, Energy (XLE) had been the largest out performer, gaining more than 8%. Meanwhile, Materials (XLB), Utilities (XLU), Communications Services (XLC) and Financials (XLF) all beat the returns of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) for the month.Notably, this put Financials and Energy year-to-date performance above that of the benchmark index, furthering signs of a broadening out of the market rally from one that had largely been driven by gains in Tech and Communication Services (which contains several large tech companies).""What's happened so far this year, is more signs of a broadening under the surface,"" Citi US equity strategist Scott Chronert told Yahoo Finance.Chronert added that sectors that have outperformed are typically tied to economic growth while the sectors that have lagged the S&P 500 this year like Consumer Staples (XLP) would typically be considered defensive plays utilized when investors are prepping for an economic downturn.""What we're arguing is that that move [in stocks to star the year] is reflecting, one, conviction in the AI growth opportunity, but two is also reflecting increased confidence in a soft landing,"" Chronert said.Multiple strategists have told Yahoo Finance this rotation likely has further to run if the economic outlook remains intact or improves. If, however, the outlook dampens, the ""stealthy"" rotation among sectors could shift once again, according to Charles Schwab chief investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders.""If we were to see that economic growth deterioration, even if it meant that the Fed can justify starting to ease sooner and ease more aggressively, I think what you would see, even if you didn't see a major corrective phase for the indexes, you would probably see under the surface, a shift away from more cyclical areas, probably back to more defensive areas,"" Sonders told Yahoo Finance.Wed, March 27, 2024 at 10:15 AM PDTAlexandra CanalDisney, DeSantis board reach settlement in Florida lawsuitDisney (DIS) and the state of Florida reached a settlement on Wednesday to end litigation over the company's long-standing special tax district.The district, previously known as the Reedy Creek Improvement District (RCID), allowed Disney to operate as a self-governing entity since its inception; however, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis seized control of the district last year following Disney's opposition to the state's ""Don't Say Gay"" law. The law forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity from kindergarten through third grade.""We are pleased to put an end to all litigation pending in state court in Florida between Disney and the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District,"" Jeff Vahle, president of Walt Disney World, said in a statement.""This agreement opens a new chapter of constructive engagement with the new leadership of the district and serves the interests of all parties by enabling significant continued investment and the creation of thousands of direct and indirect jobs and economic opportunity in the State,"" he added.The high-profile Florida showdown has served as a years-long overhang for Disney as it fends off proxy battles and grapples with challenges that include a declining linear TV business, slower growth in its parks business, and losses in its streaming division.According to the settlement, both parties ""now express a mutual desire to resolve all disputes"" related to pending litigation in Florida's state court.The settlement also included language that suggests Disney may drop its federal complaint against Gov. DeSantis ""pending negotiations among other matters of a new development agreement between Disney and the District.""Last month, Disney filed a notice of appeal after a federal judge dismissed its free speech case against the governor, determining the company's position ultimately ""lacked standing,"" or the right to sue DeSantis and a separate government official.Disney filed the federal lawsuit last April, alleging DeSantis and the CFTOD board launched a ""targeted campaign of government retaliation"" to punish Disney for its position on ""Don't Say Gay.""Read more here and check out Yahoo Finance's timeline of the saga below:Wed, March 27, 2024 at 9:30 AM PDT Josh SchaferReddit shares slump as Hedgeye initiates short positionReddit stock fell more than 12% in afternoon trade on Wednesday following a new short report from Hedgeye Risk Management. After the stock more than doubled from its initial IPO price, Hedgeye described shares of the social media company as ""grossly overvalued"" and argued the stock has reached meme stock territory.""While we expect 1Q24 results to show positive fundamental momentum, our attention is focused on 2H24 and 1H25 where we expect a rapid deceleration in user and revenue growth,"" Hedgeye wrote in the reporrt. ""We see ~50% downside to it's original IPO price.""The report added: ""At [$75 per share Reddit] was the most expensive stock among internet and media peers in our coverage. To justify the price, we think RDDT would need to sustain +35% revenue growth in 1H24 (versus our 25-27%) and +30% in 2H24 (versus our 20-23%).""Hedgeye claims Reddit's platform overall is ""niche"" and could struggle to gain mainstream adoption in the longterm, including in international markets given Reddit's dominant language on the site is English.Hedgeye also points out that while Reddit has formed an AI pitch to investors given a new deal with Google, its prospects in the space are ""nascent"" with ""uncertainties around the long-term value and scalability.""Wed, March 27, 2024 at 8:39 AM PDTAlexandra CanalTrump Media stock surges again following strong market debutTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT) soared as much as 14% on Wednesday in its second day of trading on the Nasdaq (^IXIC).The parent company of Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social climbed 16% in its first official trading day on Tuesday. It went public after merging with special purpose acquisition vehicle Digital World Acquisition Corp. in a deal approved by shareholders last week.DJT's strong debut comes amid a meme stock resurgence as some trades viewed as lacking fundamentals have seen eye-popping returns.According to an SEC filing from DWAC, Trump Media lost $49 million in the first nine months of last year and brought in $3.4 million in revenue. At current levels, its market cap now sits around $8 billion.Other meme-friendly names like Reddit (RDDT) and GameStop (GME) had also seen massive run-ups in recent days while riskier assets like Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and commodities have soared since the start of the year.Some names are coming back down to earth. Reddit and GameStop were down about 13% and 16%, respectively, in Wednesday's trade.Short interest in DJT stock — bets that the stock price will fall rather than rise — is about 11% of outstanding shares, according to the latest data from S3 Partners.

The gauge traded well off session highs as some of the names that have powered the bull run came under pressure, with Nvidia Corp. leading losses in megacaps. The Nasdaq 100 wavered after an advance that approached 1%. Treasuries rose.Wall Street geared up for heightened swings, with institutional investors checking their exposures at the end of the quarter to make sure they meet strict allocation limits between equities and bonds, as well as between domestic and international shares.With stocks set to cap another strong quarter, pension funds are likely to sell an estimated $32 billion in equities to rebalance their positions, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. After the S&P 500 soared about 25% since late October, many have flagged concern that positioning is stretched and stocks are more vulnerable to short-term profit taking.“We saw some oddly timed action in the stock market yesterday,” said Matt Maley at Miller Tabak + Co. “So, maybe the quarterly rebalancing that everybody talks about each quarter, but rarely has much impact, just might create some more interesting moves before the week (and quarter) are over.”Traders also awaited Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller’s remarks at an event after the close.To Thierry Wizman at Macquarie, Waller may offer a “rebuke of Jay Powell’s dovishness.”Story continues“While not dismissing the prospect of a June cut, Waller may point to sturdy US aggregate demand and ‘sticky’ inflation in the January and February data to justify fewer rate cuts than the median ‘dots’ imply,” Wizman noted.Gentle rate cuts could create a mildly supportive environment for risk assets — which could also be helped by a high level of cash on the sidelines, according to Kristina Hooper at Invesco.“For those who believe that such cuts are already priced into stocks and fixed income, I would argue that there are other catalysts” Hooper said. “Keep in mind there is a high level of cash sitting on the sidelines, some of which could rotate into equities and fixed income, especially if rates begin to fall and/or more investors develop a fear of missing out.”To illustrate, she cited the fact that money-market assets peaked in the fourth quarter of 2008 before dropping significantly.“It seems no coincidence that cash started to move off the sidelines just as stocks began a strong and lengthy multi-year rally in March of 2009,” she concluded.A blistering five-month rally in US equities has seen valuations soar, but plenty of corners in the S&P 500 are still historically cheap.At the sector level, eight of 11 groups trade at a discount compared to pre-pandemic levels — while only technology, materials, and industrials are trading at a premium, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data.Meanwhile, nearly three fourths of the gauge trade below its capitalization-weighted price-to-book ratio — a measure that compares market capitalization to book value, used to find undervalued pockets of the market, BI’s analysis showed. A similar share of companies, 71%, carry forward-price-to earnings multiples beneath the index level, with roughly half below their average before Covid.“Multiples for the next year appear much loftier than they seem for the S&P 500 index, distorted by analysts’ conservative forecasts for an earnings recovery from the 2022-2023 profit recession,” said a BI team led by Gina Martin Adams.Trailing 12-month S&P 500 earnings per share contracted 13% from the March 2022 high — well short of the median 25.8% peak-to-trough drop in economic contractions since the 1969-1970 recession, and 16.8% excluding the 2007-09 and 2020 extreme outliers, the BI strategists noted. Only two recessions — 1980 and 1969-1970 — had shallower drops in earnings.S&P 500 EPS on median jumped 15.6% in the first 12 months after each recessionary trough since 1969 (excluding 2007-09 and 2020), the analysis showed.“Perhaps reflecting the smaller-than-usual drop that occurred in this cycle, consensus forecasts a mere 11.1% rise in earnings over the next year,” the strategists concluded.Corporate Highlights:Former president Donald Trump’s Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. is powering higher after a stellar Nasdaq debut.Merck & Co. won US approval for a new treatment for a rare, dangerous form of high blood pressure that’s expected to be among the company’s hits as sales from successful older drugs begin fading later this decade.Robinhood Markets Inc., best known for offering commission-free trading, is rolling out a credit card to US consumers as it looks to become a broader financial-services company.Carnival Corp. slightly raised its outlook for 2024 amid record setting demand for cruises. However, the company also citied a negative impact related to the collapse of Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore and is continuing to feel the effects of conflict in the Red Sea region.Reddit Inc. slipped after Hedgeye Risk Management released a report adding it as a short idea and saying it should trade about 50% below current levels.Fisker Inc. dramatically reduced the price of the Ocean sport utility vehicle — its only model — as the electric-car maker struggles to stay in business.Gamestop Corp. reported adjusted earnings per share and net sales that missed the average analyst estimate.Altimmune Inc.’s experimental weight-loss drug minimized muscle decline in a mid-stage trial, a sign that it can address a problem obesity drugmakers have been racing to solve.

He also reiterated his warning that excessive crowding in the market’s best-performing stocks raises the risk of an imminent correction.“It just might come one day out of the blue. This has happened in the past, we’ve had flash crashes,” Lakos-Bujos said in a webinar. “One big fund starts de-levering some positions, a second fund hears that and tries to re-position, the third fund basically gets caught off guard, and the next thing you know, we start having a bigger and bigger momentum unwind.”His remarks come in the final trading days of a strong first quarter for stocks, with the S&P 500 Index on track for a roughly 10% return. The broad US equities benchmark will post its fifth consecutive month of gains as corporate earnings remain strong, enthusiasm around artificial intelligence keeps building, the US economy continues to be healthy and the Federal Reserve signals its willingness to cut interest rates this yearBut to Lakos-Bujas, that list actually is a reason for concern.“A lot of goodies have gotten priced in,” he said, from earnings and Fed expectations, to even a potential election victory for former president Donald Trump, which he said would be viewed as helpful for the market. Moreover, he sees few sources of upside surprise beyond Nvidia Corp. and the prospects for AI innovation. “That source of upside surprise is becoming more and more limited, and on the flipside, you do have more risks that are hovering in the background,” he said.Story continuesMoreover, looking at recent history, the rush into popular momentum stocks like the Magnificent Seven typically is followed by a correction. It’s happened three times since the Global Financial Crisis.“Historically, whenever you had such a high degree of crowding it was a question of weeks before the momentum factor faced a big fat left tail unwind,” Lakos-Bujas said, pointing to Tesla Inc.’s 27% plunge and Apple Inc.’s 10% drop this year after strong 2023s as examples of what’s to come.“Who is going to be the next one — and when?” he said.Lakos-Bujas and other strategists at JPMorgan, including Marko Kolanovic, have been among few bearish contrarians on Wall Street this year. As most of their peers raise their US equity outlooks, with the stock market continually setting new highs, they have remained pessimistic that the gains would stick. Among the big Wall Street banks, the firm holds the lowest year-end target on the S&P 500 of 4,200, implying a drop of nearly 20% from Wednesday’s level.The bank’s house view on US equities has failed to materialize for two consecutive years as Lakos-Bujas and Kolanovic remained bullish throughout most of 2022’s rout and then held a bearish stance during last year’s 24% rally in the S&P 500.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekIn a Passive World, These Stockpickers Are ThrivingAI Is Putting the Silicon Back in Silicon ValleyHong Kong’s Elderly Are Increasingly Retiring in Mainland ChinaHow Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the CardsTesla’s Hunt for Self-Driving Revenue©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

Motley Fool,Why QuantumScape Stock Is Up Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-quantumscape-stock-today-182542157.html,"The battery start-up has sent a new prototype to customers for testing, a significant milestone.","Shares of electric vehicle (EV) battery start-up QuantumScape (NYSE: QS) were trading higher on Wednesday after the company said it had hit a key milestone on its development path.As of 2 p.m. ET, QuantumScape's stock was up about 7.2% from Tuesday's closing price.QuantumScape hit an important milestone this weekQuantumScape said in a statement that it has begun shipping a new prototype battery to its automaker customers for evaluation. The prototype battery, called Alpha-2, incorporates many of the improvements QuantumScape has made to its design and production processes over the past year. Delivering it to customers is a milestone in the company's 2024 plan.QuantumScape said that the new Alpha-2 prototype has only six layers (versus 24 in its last prototype), but it's more energy dense thanks to cathodes with more active material and a series of smaller improvements that add up to a more efficient package for the battery, with less internal space wasted.Image source: Getty Images.The company said that while the Alpha-2 isn't a full-size commercial product, it incorporates the key features of the full-size and close-to-production ""Beta-0"" prototype it's aiming to ship later this year. In the meantime, the Alpha-2 allows QuantumScape's automotive customers to test the performance and reliability of a battery with the most significant improvements made over the last year.Who are those customers? Volkswagen is one; it owns about 15% of QuantumScape. The battery start-up is believed to have at least one or two other automakers evaluating its prototypes, but it hasn't yet said which.A slow-motion race toward a critical goalBattery technology advances very slowly. QuantumScape has been at this for over a decade. But it's now getting close: If all goes well -- something that isn't common in the battery development space -- it could begin volume production of its batteries before the end of next year.Story continuesIs that likely?

Motley Fool,Nio Just Cut Delivery Estimates. Is It Time to Sell the Stock?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nio-just-cut-delivery-estimates-180523092.html,Nio's sales growth has slowed as early adopters have already gone electric in the Chinese market.,"American depositary shares of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Nio (NYSE: NIO) plunged as much as 7% Wednesday morning after the company lowered first-quarter delivery estimates.Nio had previously told investors it expected to ship as many as 33,000 vehicles in the quarterly period. Now it sees only about 30,000 units to be delivered. That news added to the pessimism investors have already felt regarding Nio's prospects. Nio shares are now down about 50% just this year.Is the electric vehicle market already saturated?China is the world's largest EV market. Even as Nio expands into Europe, it is relying on its home market to continue growing quickly. Last year, almost 9 million battery-electric vehicles were sold in China, the U.S. and Europe combined. More than two-thirds of those were in China. But the rate of growth has been slowing and automakers are slashing prices to try to continue supporting growth.With many early adopters already having purchased vehicles, a slowdown in growth has been evident in 2024. Nio's monthly unit volume sales have dropped noticeably since peaking last July.Data source: Nio. Chart by author.Investors need to decide whether they believe the slowing growth trend is just temporary, or whether a long-term pivot to electrify transportation is coming. Citigroup analyst Jeff Chung still sees about 27% of new car sales in China being all-electric in 2024. In the U.S. penetration is much lower so far, with only about 8% of car sales being fully electric.For those who believe the runway for adoption remains long, investing in Nio and other EV makers could make sense.
